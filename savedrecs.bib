Title = {A Social Media Campaign (\#datasaveslives) to Promote the Benefits of
   Using Health Data for Research Purposes: Mixed Methods Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide
   audience about scientific research, including the public. However,
   little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding
   what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media
   campaign \#datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive
   examples of the use and reuse of health data in research.
   Objective: This study aims to examine how the \#datasaveslives hashtag
   was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to
   provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the
   UK health informatics research community and further afield.
   Methods: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included
   the hashtag \#datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform
   Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a
   combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the
   frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to
   analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag
   users.
   Results: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets
   featuring \#datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total,
   66.01\% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once.
   Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent
   policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events.
   Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an
   interconnected series of groups of \#datasaveslives users in academia,
   health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic
   analysis of tweets showed that \#datasaveslives was used for a broader
   range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting,
   encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for
   data sharing.
   Conclusions: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign
   was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to
   disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the
   findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and
   bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors
   related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals
   to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore social network analysis (SNA) as an additional
   approach to elucidate quantifiable insight from qualitative
   health-related textual data. Methods: Key concepts gained from thematic
   analyses of a set of qualitative health data obtained from an
   implementation study was analysed using the Excel Add-on module NodeXL
   Results: Our results show that SNA provided useful visualisation and
   quantifiable information of the relationship between key concepts
   obtained from the thematic analysis. Discussion: SNA is a useful
   technique for exploring and analysing qualitative data, particularly
   when the research interest is in complex relationships that may exist
   among a large number of qualitative variables. In addition to providing
   a way to visualise the relationship between concepts, SNA provides
   metric measures that can be further analysed quantitatively. Conclusion:
   The SNA approach allows researchers to explore deeper relationships that
   may exist among various variables and enable researchers to derive
   potentially a fuller and more complete appreciation and comprehension of
   health-related data.},

Abstract = {Text, images, geotags and other data from social media sites lend
   researchers a unique window into population health trends and disease
   spread. While these data provide the opportunity to track and measure
   health outcomes across geographic regions, over extended periods of
   time, and through complex social networks, they also present challenges.
   Most notably, these data carry significant biases due to demographic
   differences in who chooses to use each platform, and what they choose to
   share. While several publications have discussed the limitations of
   leveraging social media data for public health research, the amount of
   literature systematically investigating their demographic bias and
   exploring mitigation strategies is limited and ripe for
   interdisciplinary contributions. In this discussion paper, we highlight
   that understanding the strengths and limitations of these data sources
   would enable a rigorous assessment of their usefulness for public health
   research and provide a means for quantifying uncertainty in research
   findings.},

Abstract = {Social media networks have shown rapid growth in the past, and massive
   social data are generated which can reveal behavior or emotion
   propensities of users. Numerous social researchers leverage machine
   learning technology to build social media analytic models which can
   detect the abnormal behaviors or mental illnesses from the social media
   data effectively. Although the researchers only public the prediction
   interfaces of the machine learning models, in general, these interfaces
   may leak information about the individual data records on which the
   models were trained. Knowing a certain user's social media record was
   used to train a model can breach user privacy. In this paper, we present
   SocInf and focus on the fundamental problem known as membership
   inference. The key idea of SocInf is to construct a mimic model which
   has a similar prediction behavior with the public model, and then we can
   disclose the prediction differences between the training and testing
   data set by abusing the mimic model. With elaborated analytics on the
   predictions of the mimic model, SocInf can thus infer whether a given
   record is in the victim model's training set or not. We empirically
   evaluate the attack performance of SocInf on machine learning models
   trained by Xgboost, logistics, and online cloud platform. Using the
   realistic data, the experiment results show that SocInf can achieve an
   inference accuracy and precision of 73\% and 84\%, respectively, in
   average, and of 83\% and 91\% at best.},

Abstract = {Various events and their perspectives around the world are discussed or
   posted at every moment on social media platforms like Twitter in near
   real-time, forming an enriched repository of information as historical
   records or time series. These include people's sentiments, emotions,
   opinions, and other information such as situational aspects of the
   spreading of a particular disease, ailment, or a population explosion of
   some vectors or pathogens. Exploring and harnessing such information
   about a disease for surveillance to prevent and control its spreading or
   becoming epidemic or pandemic is worthwhile for a country or the world.
   In this paper, we correlate tweeting activity with the reported disease
   cases, and take advantage of the predictive power of neural networks and
   auto-regressive models to estimate disease incidences for the current
   week (aka nowcasting) considering the social media data and the disease
   case counts reported by the Government agencies. We propose Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network models and autoregressive moving
   average models with two channels of inputs to incorporate social media
   and historic disease case count data for predicting current disease case
   counts. We employ various LSTM network models and autoregressive moving
   average models to estimate the current week's disease case count and
   compared their performance considering tweets as exogenous input to
   these models. The experimental results establish the efficacy of the
   LSTM network models with dynamically merged inputs for predicting
   disease case count with least prediction error.},

Title = {Emulating a virtual digital cohort study based on social media data as a

Abstract = {With an unprecedented volume of data generated online by individuals, it
   becomes more and more relevant to analyze them for health-related
   purposes. However, the field of digital epidemiology lacks
   standardization which prevents it from moving away from a
   reproducibility crisis. In this article, we introduce the concept of a
   virtual digital cohort study (VDCS), a standardized method that can
   mimic an actual cohort study design exclusively thanks to social media
   data. We draw parallels between principles in epidemiology and their
   adaptations for a VDCS, and we use two diabetes-related examples to
   illustrate how a VDCS can help address some research questions. We also
   argue that developing a VDCS is a valid alternative to a costly,
   real-life, cohort implementation for some but not all research
   questions. We provide guidelines and recommendations to future
   researchers willing to launch a VDCS and, finally, we demonstrate why
   combining both a virtual and a real-life cohort study, sequentially or
   in parallel, can help conduct more relevant, patient-centric,
   research.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. This

Abstract = {Social media data can provide valuable information regarding people's
   behaviors and health outcomes. Previous studies have shown that social
   media data can be extracted to monitor and predict infectious disease
   outbreaks. These same approaches can be applied to other fields
   including physical activity research and forensic science. Social media
   data have the potential to provide real-time monitoring and prediction
   of physical activity level in a given region. This tool can be valuable
   to public health organizations as it can overcome the time lag in the
   reporting of physical activity epidemiology data faced by traditional
   research methods (e.g. surveys, observational studies). As a result,
   this tool could help public health organizations better mobilize and
   target physical activity interventions. The first part of this paper
   aims to describe current approaches (e.g. topic modeling, sentiment
   analysis and social network analysis) that could be used to analyze
   social media data to provide real-time monitoring of physical activity
   level. The second aim of this paper was to discuss ways to apply social
   media analysis to other fields such as forensic sciences and provide
   recommendations to further social media research. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {Introduction:Suicide is a significant public health problem among
   teenagers and young adults in the United States, placing significant
   stress on emergency departments (EDs) to effectively screen and assess
   for the presence of suicidality in a rapid yet efficient
   manner.Methods:A literature search was performed using PubMed and
   MEDLINE with the following terms: Social media, Suicide, Facebook,
   Twitter, MySpace, Snapchat, Ethics, Digital Media, and Forums and Blog.
   Data were extracted from each article, specifically the sample size,
   study setting, and design. Only English-language studies were included.
   We reviewed the reference lists of included articles for additional
   studies, as well. Abstracts, unpublished data, and duplicate articles
   were excluded.Results:A total of 363 articles met our initial criteria.
   Studies older than 10 years and/or in a language other than English were
   removed. After review, a total of 31 peer-reviewed articles were
   included in the study. Teenagers and young adults often fail to disclose
   risk factors to physicians, despite sharing them with the public on
   social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore,
   physician access to a patient's social media can assist in identifying
   suicidal ideation and/or acts.Conclusions:Viewing a patient's social
   media accounts can help ED physicians gain perspective into his or her
   mental health status and identify those at risk for suicide; however,
   ethical and privacy concerns associated with this method of data
   gathering make implementation of such a practice controversial. To
   justify its use, formal prospective studies analyzing if and how
   physician access to a patient's social media influences care should be
   performed.},

Abstract = {Social media is an undeniable reality in our lives. The professional use
   of social media is increasing with every passing day. It has provided
   new avenues of service delivery in individual and hospital practices.
   But the operational structure of most social media platforms can create
   problems for its professional use in healthcare, as the controls that
   exists in physical environment under regulatory frameworks, aren't
   available there. Indeed, it's a daunting task to maintain, for example,
   confidentiality and ownership of health data, which once shared stays
   forever in cyberspace. Healthcare providers especially Physicians and
   all other stakeholders should focus on this changing face of healthcare
   and try to develop guidelines which can lessen fears, promote optimal
   use, and can help maintain ethos of practice of medicine on social
   media.},

   Neuroscience Perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Social media platforms are increasingly used across many population
   groups not only to communicate and consume information, but also to
   express symptoms of psychological distress and suicidal thoughts. The
   detection of suicidal ideation (SI) can contribute to suicide
   prevention. Twitter data suggesting SI have been associated with
   negative emotions (e.g., shame, sadness) and a number of geographical
   and ecological variables (e.g., geographic location, environmental
   stress). Other important research contributions on SI come from studies
   in neuroscience. To date, very few research studies have been conducted
   that combine different disciplines (epidemiology, health geography,
   neurosciences, psychology, and social media big data science), to build
   innovative research directions on this topic. This article aims to offer
   a new interdisciplinary perspective, that is, a Population Neuroscience
   perspective on SI in order to highlight new ways in which multiple
   scientific fields interact to successfully investigate emotions and
   stress in social media to detect SI in the population. We argue that a
   Population Neuroscience perspective may help to better understand the
   mechanisms underpinning SI and to promote more effective strategies to
   prevent suicide timely and at scale.},

Title = {Social network analysis of COVID-19 transmission in Karnataka, India},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Abstract = {We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel coronavirus
   (COVID-19) outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to assess the potential of
   SNA as a tool for outbreak monitoring and control. We analysed contact
   tracing data of 1147 COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years,
   61.99\% aged 11-40, 742 males), anonymised and made public by the
   Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to
   create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases)
   and edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree was
   1-47 for 199 (17.35\%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76\%)
   nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness.
   Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44\% cases. Bangalore city had the
   highest caseload in the state (229, 20\%), but comparatively low cluster
   formation. Thirty-four (2.96\%) `super-spreaders' (outdegree > 5) caused
   60\% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can
   allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint
   key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for
   rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially
   achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.},

Title = {Social Media Addiction among Vietnam Youths: Patterns and Correlated
   Factors},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Prior research has investigated how the excessive use of
   social media has an impact on one's functioning. Youths are among the
   most vulnerable subjects to the impacts of social media overuse,
   especially in Vietnam (a developing country). However, very little
   evidence has been provided on social media addiction. This work aims to
   determine the prevalence of social media addiction amongst Vietnamese
   individuals and the factors associated with social media addiction.
   Method: An online cross-sectional study was conducted from June to July
   2020 in Vietnam. Participants completed the structured questionnaire,
   which comprised four main components: (1) social characteristics; (2)
   The Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale; (3) stress associated with
   neglect and negative reactions by online peers and fear of missing out
   (FOMO); and (4) status of social media platform usage. Results: Some
   demographic factors, such as gender, the locality of accommodation, and
   relationship status affected the overall scores. The results also
   indicated Facebook, Zalo, and Youtube to be the most popular social
   media platforms among Vietnamese youths. Individuals who used social
   media for gaming also had higher BSMAS scores. FOMO and stress
   associated with neglect by online peers had a high correlation with
   social media addiction. Conclusions: This study is one of the first
   studies to examine social media addiction and its associated factors in
   Vietnam. Interventions for social media addiction need to be developed
   in different fields: clinical research, policy, and education.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of social media on the wave of
   Palestinian lone-wolf attacks against Israelis from October 2015 through
   September 2016. My principal argument is that social media played an
   important role in shaping the identity, perceptions, and behavioral
   patterns of dozens of assailants, and was key in creating the dynamic
   that ultimately characterized both the spreading of the idea of
   lone-wolf attacks and its execution. Social media reflected reality on
   the ground while simultaneously nourishing, amplifying, and escalating
   the situation by providing a platform for the emergence of new sources
   of authority, including an online subculture with distinct codes and
   pseudo-ritual patterns to support assailants. Social media also
   contributed substantially to shaping the contagious character of the
   attacks, and their capacity to persist without direct organizational
   guidance, following a typical epidemiological dynamic of spread,
   containment, and preservation.},

   While 43.80\% of participants considered real-life patient-physician
   friendship acceptable, 37.59\% thought it was acceptable to be virtual
   friends with their physicians, and only 27.14\% would accept friend
   requests from their patients. Students thought their physician's social
   media posts would not affect their trust (48.84\%) and respect (49.22\%)
   for their physician, and 47.29\% thought physician's posts on social
   media would make them feel closer to her. Finally, 64.34\% thought that
   learning more about patients via social media posts would not impact
   their attitude toward these patients. Discussion: Evaluating the medical
   students' perceptions of the issue will shape the structure of their
   medical education proactively and shed a light to their professional
   lives mainly with an ethical perspective.},

Abstract = {The digital world in which we live is changing rapidly. The evolving
   media environment is having a direct impact on traditional forms of
   communication and knowledge translation in public health and
   epidemiology. Openly accessible digital media can be used to reach a
   broader and more diverse audience of trainees, scientists, and the lay
   public than can traditional forms of scientific communication. The new
   digital landscape for delivering content is vast, and new platforms are
   continuously being added. In this article, we focus on several,
   including Twitter and podcasting, and discuss their relevance to
   epidemiology and science communication. We highlight 3 key reasons why
   we think epidemiologists should be engaging with these mediums: 1)
   science communication, 2) career advancement, and 3) development of a
   community and public service. Other positive and negative consequences
   of engaging in these forms of new media are also discussed. The authors
   of this commentary are all engaged in social media and podcasting for
   scientific communication, and we reflect on our experiences with these
   mediums as tools to advance the field of epidemiology.},

Abstract = {Social media are increasingly used to collect data and report on the
   personal health status, on health issues, symptoms and experiences with
   treatments. The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents
   a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and
   clinical decision making.
   Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them
   accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real
   time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data
   could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications,
   including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical
   Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases
   and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that
   can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as
   laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records
   and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so
   collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are
   employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases
   and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients'
   health issues more efficiently.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To better understand the benefits and harms of engagement with
   online pediatric liver disease communities within social media.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of caregivers of children with liver
   disease participating in online pediatric liver disease communities
   within social media, as well as a survey of healthcare providers (e.g.,
   physicians, surgeons, nurse coordinators) from this field to better
   understand the perceived benefits and harms of participation.
   Results: Among 138 caregivers of children with liver disease that
   completed the survey, 97.8\% agreed social media was a good place to
   learn about patient experiences and 88\% agreed it was a good source of
   general information. Among caregivers, 84.8\% agreed social media helps
   them to better advocate for their child. While 18\% agreed that the
   information over social media was equal to the information from their
   healthcare team and 19\% neither agreed/disagreed, only 3\% indicated
   they would use this information to change care without telling their
   provider; in contrast, among 217 healthcare providers, 55\% believed
   social media may lead caregivers to change management without telling
   their team.
   Conclusion: Engagement with online disease-specific communities in
   social media yields several benefits for caregivers and, in contrast to
   healthcare providers' concerns, participation is unlikely to lead to
   problems including caregivers changing the treatment plan without first
   discussing these plans with their team. Openness between caregivers and
   medical teams about the role for social media can help to improve trust
   and maximize the potential benefits of engagement with these groups.},

Abstract = {The degree of relatedness and an interacting unifying central member can
   exacerbate disease transmission within a social group. The severity of
   the disease depends on the route, dose and frequency of infection.
   Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the
   spread of the disease. LionsPanthera leoare social carnivores with
   individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion
   behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals
   and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger
   National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine
   tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal
   disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed
   us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of
   interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three
   prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised
   degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between
   pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other,
   a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in
   dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so,
   within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear
   from a pride. Persistence of the disease as noted for lions in Kruger
   can only realize through unlikely transmissions or through feeding on
   infected prey. Our results support lions as a spill-over host.},

Abstract = {Epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology frequently employ Real-World Data
   (RWD) from healthcare teams to inform research. These data sources
   usually include signs, symptoms, tests, and treatments, but may lack
   important information such as the patient's diet or adherence or quality
   of life. By harnessing digital tools a new fount of evidence, Patient
   (or Citizen/Person) Generated Health Data (PGHD), is becoming more
   readily available. This review focusses on the advantages and
   considerations in using PGHD for pharmacoepidemiological research. New
   and corroborative types of data can be collected directly from patients
   using digital devices, both passively and actively. Practical issues
   such as patient engagement, data linking, validation, and analysis are
   among important considerations in the use of PGHD. In our ever
   increasingly patient-centric world, PGHD incorporated into more
   traditional Real-Word data sources offers innovative opportunities to
   expand our understanding of the complex factors involved in health and
   the safety and effectiveness of disease treatments.
   Pharmacoepidemiologists have a unique role in realizing the potential of
   PGHD by ensuring that robust methodology, governance, and analytical
   techniques underpin its use to generate meaningful research results.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms have become ubiquitous and allow users to share
   information in real-time. Our study uses data analytics as an approach
   to explore non-communicable diseases on social media platforms and to
   identify trends and patterns of related disease symptoms. Exploring
   epidemiological patterns of non-communicable diseases is vital given
   that they have become prevalent in low-income communities, accounting
   for about 38 million deaths worldwide. We collected data related to
   multiple disease conditions from the Twitter microblogging platform and
   zoomed into symptoms related to heart diseases. As part of our analyses,
   we focussed on the mechanism and trends of disease occurrences. Our
   results show that specific symptoms may be attributed to multiple
   disease conditions and it is viable to identify trends and patterns of
   their occurrences using a structured analytics approach. This can then
   act as a supplementary tool to support epidemiological initiatives that
   monitor non-communicable diseases. Based on the study's results, we
   identify that non-communicable disease surveillance approach using
   social media analytics could support the design of effective health
   intervention strategies.},

Abstract = {Social media has become a major source for analyzing all aspects of
   daily life. Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as
   the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed
   on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to
   monitor people's health over time. The use of tweets has several
   benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost.
   Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies
   and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk
   factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems:
   health transition detection and health transition prediction. We first
   propose the Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model (TM-ATAM), a new latent
   model dedicated to solving the first problem by capturing transitions
   that involve health-related topics. TM-ATAM is a non-obvious extension
   to ATAM that was designed to extract health-related topics. It learns
   health-related topic transitions by minimizing the prediction error on
   topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and
   geographic granularities. To solve the second problem, we develop
   T-ATAM, a Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model where time is treated as a
   random variable natively inside ATAM. Our experiments on an 8-month
   corpus of tweets show that TM-ATAM outperforms TM-LDA in estimating
   health-related transitions from tweets for different geographic
   populations. We examine the ability of TM-ATAM to detect transitions due
   to climate conditions in different geographic regions. We then show how
   T-ATAM can be used to predict the most important transition and
   additionally compare T-ATAM with CDC (Center for Disease Control) data
   and Google Flu Trends.},

Title = {Social Media Terms and Conditions and Informed Consent From Children:
   Ethical Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Terms and conditions define the relationship between social
   media companies and users. However, these legal agreements are long and
   written in a complex language. It remains questionable whether users
   understand the terms and conditions and are aware of the consequences of
   joining such a network. With children from a young age interacting with
   social media, companies are acquiring large amounts of data, resulting
   in longitudinal data sets that most researchers can only dream of. The
   use of social media by children is highly relevant to their mental and
   physical health for 2 reasons: their health can be adversely affected by
   social media and their data can be used to conduct health research.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to offer an ethical analysis of how
   the most common social media apps and services inform users and obtain
   their consent regarding privacy and other issues and to discuss how
   lessons from research ethics can lead to trusted partnerships between
   users and social media companies. Our paper focuses on children, who
   represent a sensitive group among users of social media platforms.
   Methods: A thematic analysis of the terms and conditions of the 20 most
   popular social media platforms and the 2 predominant mobile phone
   ecosystems (Android and iOS) was conducted. The results of this analysis
   served as the basis for scoring these platforms.
   Results: The analysis showed that most platforms comply with the age
   requirements issued by legislators. However, the consent process during
   sign-up was not taken seriously. Terms and conditions are often too long
   and difficult to understand, especially for younger users. The same
   applies to age verification, which is not realized proactively but
   instead relies on other users who report underaged users.
   Conclusions: This study reveals that social media networks are still
   lacking in many respects regarding the adequate protection of children.
   Consent procedures are flawed because they are too complex, and in some
   cases, children can create social media accounts without sufficient age
   verification or parental oversight. Adopting measures based on key
   ethical principles will safeguard the health and well-being of children.
   This could mean standardizing the registration process in accordance
   with modern research ethics procedures: give users the key facts that
   they need in a format that can be read easily and quickly, rather than
   forcing them to wade through chapters of legal language that they cannot
   understand. Improving these processes would help safeguard the mental
   health of children and other social media users.},

Title = {Prediction of vaccine hesitancy based on social media traffic among
   Israeli parents using machine learning strategies},
Journal = {ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Introduction Vaccines have contributed to substantial reductions of
   morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases, mainly in
   children. However, vaccine hesitancy was listed by the World Health
   Organization (WHO) in 2019 as one of the top ten threats to world
   health. Aim To employ machine-learning strategies to assess how on-line
   content regarding vaccination affects vaccine hesitancy. Methods We
   collected social media posts and responses from vaccination discussion
   groups and forums on leading social platforms, including Facebook and
   Tapuz (A user content website that contains blogs and forums). We
   investigated 65,603 records of children aged 0-6 years who are insured
   in Maccabi's Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We applied three
   machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Random forest and
   Neural networks) to predict vaccination among Israeli children, based on
   demographic and social media traffic. Results Higher hesitancy was
   associated with more social media traffic, for most of the vaccinations.
   The addition of the social media traffic features improved the
   performances of most of the models. However, for Rota virus, Hepatitis A
   and hepatitis B, the performances of all algorithms (with and without
   the social media features) were close to random (accuracy up to 0.63 and
   F1 up to 0.65). We found a negative association between on-line
   discussions and vaccination. Conclusions There is an association between
   social media traffic and vaccine hesitancy. Policy makers are encouraged
   to perceive social media as a main channel of communication during
   health crises. Health officials and experts are encouraged to take part
   in social media discussions, and be equipped to readily provide the
   information, support and advice that the public is looking for, in order
   to optimize vaccination actions and to improve public health},

Journal = {BMC MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Understanding the patient perspective is fundamental to delivering
   patient-centred care. In most healthcare systems, however,
   patient-reported outcomes are not regularly collected or recorded as
   part of routine clinical care, despite evidence that doing so can have
   tangible clinical benefit. In the absence of the routine collection of
   these data, research is beginning to turn to social media as a novel
   means to capture the patient voice. Publicly available social media data
   can now be analysed with relative ease, bypassing many logistical
   hurdles associated with traditional approaches and allowing for
   accelerated and cost-effective data collection. Existing work has shown
   these data can offer credible insight into the patient experience,
   although more work is needed to understand limitations with respect to
   patient representativeness and nuances of captured experience.
   Nevertheless, linking social media to electronic medical records offers
   a significant opportunity for patient views to be systematically
   collected for health services research and ultimately to improve patient
   care.},

Abstract = {Objective Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are continually emerging
   and threatening health care systems. Little attention has been paid to
   the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care
   entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department
   of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social
   network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in
   Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in
   Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed
   network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of
   relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance
   data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include
   metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such
   as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional
   networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed
   that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the
   flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not
   be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care
   hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental
   health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for
   flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health
   care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals.
   Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public

Abstract = {Social networking site smartphone applications have been widely used
   among Chinese young adults. However, less is known about their effects
   on emotional health and the mechanisms through which they function. This
   study analyzes the relationship between college students' smartphone
   social networking service use patterns, social gratification, social
   media self-control failure, and emotional health. Data was collected
   from 360 college students in China via application log tracking and a
   self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling results
   showed that, after controlling for demographic variables, the use of
   video social networking site smartphone applications was associated with
   decreased social gratification, and ultimately, adverse emotional
   health. Using social networking site smartphone applications late at
   night exhibited worse emotional health via more social media
   self-control failure. The implications for designing and using social

Title = {Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing in a cohort study to
   investigate TB transmission in an educational setting},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Background: TB outbreaks in educational institutions can result in
   significant transmission and pose a considerable threat to TB control.
   Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological
   tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties
   characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole
   genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide
   additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health
   action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with
   traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak
   in an educational setting.
   Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with
   a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through
   laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through
   clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection.
   Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and
   screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M.
   tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial
   regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated
   with case status and risk communities.
   Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7\% positivity rate) and nine
   active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was
   39.1\% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious
   case (odds ratio 7.3, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The
   community structure analysis divided the students into five communities
   based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social
   network analysis identified that the community including the suspected
   index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds
   ratio 7.5, 95\% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were
   lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single
   SNP difference.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an
   undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting
   within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome
   sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission
   network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide
   further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological
   approaches to direct public health action in this setting.},

Month = {2022 JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives: To identify patterns of interactions that may influence
   guideline panels' decision-making. Study Design and Setting: Social
   network analysis (SNA) to describe the conversation network in a
   guideline development meeting in United States. Results: We analyzed one
   two-day guideline panel meeting that included 20 members who developed a
   guideline using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
   Development and Evaluation) approach. The conversation pattern of the
   guideline panel indicated a well-connected network (density = 0.59,
   clustering coefficient = 0.82). GRADE topics on quality of evidence and
   benefits versus harms accounted for 46\%; non-GRADE factors accounted
   for 30\% of discussion. The chair, co-chair and methodologist initiated
   53\% and received 60\% of all communications in the meeting; 42\% of
   their communications occurred among themselves. SNA metrics
   (eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) indicated that these
   individuals also exerted highest influence on discussion, controlled
   information flow and were at the center of all communications. Members
   were more likely to continue previous discussion with the same
   individuals after both morning breaks (r = 0.54, P < 0.005; r = 0.17, P
   = 0.04), and after the last break on day 2 ( r = 0.44, P = 0.015).
   Conclusion: Non-GRADE factors such as breaks, and the members' roles,
   affect guideline development more than previously recognized.
   Collectively, the chair, co-chair and methodologist dominated the
   discussion. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Social media use (SMU) has become an intrinsic part of
   adolescent life. Negative consequences of SMU for adolescent health
   could include exposures to online forms of aggression. We explored age,
   gender, and cross-national differences in adolescents' engagement in
   SMU, then relationships between SMU and victimization and the
   perpetration of cyber-bullying.
   Methods: We used data on young people aged 11-15 years (weighted n =
   180,919 in 42 countries) who participated in the 2017-2018 Health
   Behaviour in School-aged Children study to describe engagement in the
   three types of SMU (intense, problematic, and talking with strangers
   online) by age and gender and then in the perpetration and victimization
   of cyber-bullying. Relationships between SMU and cyber-bullying outcomes
   were estimated using Poisson regression (weighted n = 166,647 from 42
   countries).
   Results: Variations in SMU and cyber-bullying follow developmental and
   gender-based patterns across countries. In pooled analyses, engagement
   in SMU related to cyber-bullying victimization (adjusted relative risks
   = 1.14 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.19] to 1.48 {[}95\% CI:
   1.42-1.55]) and perpetration (adjusted relative risk = 1.31 {[}95\% CI:
   1.26-1.36] to 1.84 {[}95\% CI: 1.74-1.95]). These associations were
   stronger for cyber-perpetration versus cyber-victimization and for girls
   versus boys. Problematic SMU was most strongly and consistently
   associated with cyber-bullying, both for victimization and perpetration.
   Stratified analyses showed that SMU related to cyber-victimization in
   19\%-45\% of countries and to cyber-perpetration in 38\%-86\% of
   countries.
   Conclusions: Accessibility to social media and its pervasive use has led
   to new opportunities for online aggression. The time adolescents spend
   on social media, engage in problematic use, and talk to strangers online
   each relate to cyber-bullying and merit public health intervention.
   Problematic use of social media poses the strongest and most consistent
   risk. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for

   Shifts in Cryptocurrency Price Series},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {The recent extreme volatility in cryptocurrency prices occurred in the
   setting of popular social media forums devoted to the discussion of
   cryptocurrencies. We develop a framework that discovers potential causes
   of phasic shifts in the price movement captured by social media
   discussions. This draws on principles developed in healthcare
   epidemiology where, similarly, only observational data are available.
   Such causes may have a major, one-off effect, or recurring effects on
   the trend in the price series. We find a one-off effect of regulatory
   bans on bitcoin, the repeated effects of rival innovations on ether and
   the influence of technical traders, captured through discussion of
   market price, on both cryptocurrencies. The results for Bitcoin differ
   from Ethereum, which is consistent with the observed differences in the
   timing of the highest price and the price phases. This framework could
   be applied to a wide range of cryptocurrency price series where there
   exists a relevant social media text source. Identified causes with a
   recurring effect may have value in predictive modelling, whilst one-off
   causes may provide insight into unpredictable black swan events that can
   have a major impact on a system.},

Title = {Social media use and alcohol consumption among students in Uganda: a
   cross sectional study},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Background Globally, alcohol use significantly contributes to the
   disease burden. Alcohol consumption in Uganda is related to several
   health consequences among young people, including university students.
   Social media is commonly used by students to share academic information
   and create social networks. Among young people in high-income countries,
   previous studies have also shown that social media use can have negative
   health outcomes related to alcohol use, and associated problems. To
   date, similar studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries are
   largely missing. Objective To assess the prevalence of and associations
   between social media use and alcohol consumption among university
   students in Uganda. Method This was a cross-sectional study among 996
   undergraduate students at Makerere University. Data were collected using
   a questionnaire. Alcohol use in the previous 12 months was the dependent
   variable. The independent variable was social media use categorised as
   general use, alcohol-related use, and social media lurking/passive
   participation. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess
   associations. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were reported. Results
   Nearly all students (97\%) used social media and 39\% reported alcohol
   use. Regular alcohol use was significantly associated with moderate (OR
   = 2.22, CI: 1.35-3.66) and high level general social media use (OR =
   2.45, CI: 1.43-4.20). Regular alcohol use was also associated with
   alcohol-related social media (OR = 6.46, CI: 4.04-10.30), and
   alcohol-related lurking (OR = 4.59, CI: 2.84-7.39). Similar, although
   weaker associations were identified for occasional alcohol use.
   Conclusions Approximately four in ten students reported alcohol use in
   the past year, and almost all students used social media.
   Alcohol-related social media use was associated with occasional and
   regular alcohol use, with stronger associations for regular use. These
   findings may guide further research and present an opportunity for
   potential alcohol control interventions to improve health among young
   populations in low- and middle-income countries.},

Title = {Opioid use stigmatization and destigmatization in health professional
   social media},
Journal = {ADDICTION RESEARCH \& THEORY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {375-381},
Month = {2022 SEP 3},
Abstract = {Stigmatization of opioid use constitutes a significant barrier to
   addressing the opioid crisis. Increasing use of social media by health
   professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization.
   However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization
   within health professional social media Accordingly, this study
   investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four
   Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental
   Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these
   communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or
   destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low
   and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities.
   Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly
   bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1\% quarterly
   reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR =
   0.928, 95\% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p = .0159). Mental Health also shows a
   5\% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR =
   1.05, 95\% CI 1.02-1.09, p = .00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37\%
   quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95\%
   CI 1.15-1.64, p = .00291), and Public Health a 16\% increase (IRR =
   1.16, 95\% CI 1.11-1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression
   discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of
   destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the
   longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for
   increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language,
   especially post-COVID.},

Title = {Social Media Communication and Network Correlates of HIV Infection and
   Transmission Risks Among Black Sexual Minority Men: Cross-sectional
   Digital Epidemiology Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: In the United States, HIV disproportionately affects Black
   cisgender sexual minority men (BSMM). Although epidemiological and
   behavioral surveillance are integral to identifying BSMM at risk of HIV
   infection and transmission, overreliance on self-reported data,
   inability to observe social contexts, and neglect of populations with
   limited engagement in health care systems limits their effectiveness.
   Digital epidemiological approaches drawing on social media data offer an
   opportunity to overcome these limitations by passively observing in
   organic settings activities, beliefs, behaviors, and moods that indicate
   health risks but are otherwise challenging to capture.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether
   features of Facebook communication and networks were associated with
   biological, behavioral, and psychological indicators of HIV infection
   and transmission risk.
   Methods: Facebook and survey data were collected from BSMM aged 18 to 35
   years living in Chicago (N=310). Participants' Facebook posts were
   characterized using 4 culturally tailored topic dictionaries related to
   aspects of HIV protection and risk among BSMM (sexual health; substance
   use; sex behavior; and ballroom culture, a salient subculture in
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities of color).
   Social network methods were used to capture structural features of
   BSMM's Facebook friendships (centrality, brokerage, and local
   clustering) and Facebook group affiliations. Multivariable regressions
   revealed relationships between these Facebook features and 5 ground
   truth indicators of HIV infection and transmission risk (sexually
   transmitted infection incidence, condomless sex, sex drug use,
   biomedical prevention, and depression).
   Results: Although analysis of participants' Facebook posts revealed that
   HIV-related topics occupied a small portion of the total messages posted
   by each participant, significant associations were found between the
   following HIV risk indicators and Facebook features: Condomless sex,
   including communication about sexual health (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.58,
   95\% CI 1.09-2.29), ballroom culture (OR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.63-0.93), and
   friendship centrality (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.52-0.92); Sex drug use,
   including communication about substance use (OR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.17-2.79)
   and friendship centrality (OR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.55-0.96) and brokerage (OR
   0.71, 95\% CI 0.51-0.99); Biomedical prevention, including communication
   about ballroom culture (OR 0.06, 95\% CI 0.01-0.71); and Depression,
   including communication about sexual health (beta=-0.72, 95\% CI -1.42
   to -0.02), ballroom culture (beta=.80, 95\% CI 0.27-1.34), friendship
   centrality (beta=-0.90, 95\% CI -1.60 to -0.21), and Facebook group
   affiliations (beta=.84, 95\% CI 0.25-1.43). Facebook features provided
   no significant explanatory value for sexually transmitted infection
   incidence.
   Conclusions: Finding innovative strategies to detect BSMM at risk of
   contracting or transmitting HIV is critical to eliminating HIV
   disparities in this community. The findings suggest that social media
   data enable passive observance of social and communicative contexts that
   would otherwise go undetected using traditional HIV surveillance
   methods. As such, social media data are promising complements to more
   traditional data sources.},

Title = {Reconstructing a COVID-19 outbreak within a religious group using social
   network analysis simulation in Korea},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We reconstructed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   outbreak to examine how a large cluster at a church setting spread
   before being detected and estimate the potential effectiveness of
   complying with mask-wearing guidelines rec-ommended by the government.
   METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA)
   approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time
   stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19
   within the Sarang Jeil church. A coun-terfactual experiment using a
   calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential
   benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations
   estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the outbreak,
   which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 937.3 to 970.4)
   cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The
   counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing estimated an average of
   45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1.
   The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing
   guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the
   size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and
   controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.
   Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the
   precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are
   still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are
   unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to develop
   precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places
   that are susceptible to cluster out-breaks.},

Abstract = {Recently, health social media have engaged more and more people to share
   their personal feelings, opinions, and experience in the context of
   health informatics, which has drawn increasing attention from both
   academia and industry. In this paper, we focus on the behavioral
   influence analysis based on heterogeneous health data generated in
   social media environments. An integrated deep neural network (DNN)-based
   learning model is designed to analyze and describe the latent behavioral
   influence hidden across multiple modalities, in which a convolutional
   neural network (CNN)-based framework is used to extract the time-series
   features within a certain social context. The learned features based on
   cross-modality influence analysis are then trained in a SoftMax
   classifier, which can result in a restructured representation of
   high-level features for online physician rating and classification in a
   data-driven way. Finally, two algorithms within two representative
   application scenarios are developed to provide patients with
   personalized recommendations in health social media environments.
   Experiments using the real world data demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our proposed model and method.},

Abstract = {Millions of users share their experiences on social media sites, such as
   Twitter, which in turn generate valuable data for public health
   monitoring, digital epidemiology, and other analyses of population
   health at global scale. The first, critical, task for these applications
   is classifying whether a personal health event was mentioned, which we
   call the (PHM) problem. This task is challenging for many reasons,
   including typically short length of social media posts, inventive
   spelling and lexicons, and figurative language, including hyperbole
   using diseases like ``heart attack{''} or ``cancer{''} for emphasis, and
   not as a health self-report. This problem is even more challenging for
   rarely reported, or frequent but ambiguously expressed conditions, such
   as ``stroke{''}. To address this problem, we propose a general, robust
   method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that
   combines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based
   features. WESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by
   automatically distorting the word embedding space to most effectively
   detect the true health mentions. Unlike previously proposed
   state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning techniques, WESPAD
   requires relatively little training data, which makes it possible to
   adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We
   evaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection
   benchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions
   of multiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD
   outperforms the baselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in
   cases when the number and proportion of true health mentions in the
   training data is small.},

Title = {The journey to overdose: Using spatial social network analysis as a
   novel framework to study geographic discordance in overdose deaths},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose deaths are often geographically discordant
   (the community in which the overdose death occurs is different from the
   community of residence). Thus, in many cases there is a journey to
   overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine
   characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 \%
   of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study.
   First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs
   (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant
   overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which
   journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and
   characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used
   temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent,
   sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we
   identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus
   non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower
   housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated
   relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more
   likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be
   authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved
   fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be
   accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other
   than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of
   suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to
   overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in
   metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.},

Title = {Measuring attitudes towards mental health using social media:
   investigating stigma and trivialisation},

Abstract = {BackgroundThere are numerous campaigns targeting mental health stigma.
   However, evaluating how effective these are in changing perceptions is
   complex. Social media may be used to assess stigma levels and highlight
   new trends. This study uses a social media platform, Twitter, to
   investigate stigmatising and trivialising attitudes across a range of
   mental and physical health conditions.MethodsTweets (i.e. messages)
   associated with five mental and five physical health conditions were
   collected in ten 72-h windows over a 50-day period using automated
   software. A random selection of tweets per condition was considered for
   the analyses. Tweets were categorised according to their topic and
   presence of stigmatising and trivialising attitudes. Qualitative
   thematic analysis was performed on all stigmatising and trivialising
   tweets.ResultsA total of 1,059,258 tweets were collected, and from this
   sample 1300 tweets per condition were randomly selected for analysis.
   Overall, mental health conditions were found to be more stigmatised
   (12.9\%) and trivialised (14.3\%) compared to physical conditions (8.1
   and 6.8\%, respectively). Amongst mental health conditions the most
   stigmatised condition was schizophrenia (41\%) while the most
   trivialised was obsessive compulsive disorder (33\%).ConclusionsOur
   findings show that mental health stigma is common on social media.
   Trivialisation is also common, suggesting that while society may be more
   open to discussing mental health problems, care should be taken to
   ensure this is done appropriately. This study further demonstrates the
   potential for social media to be used to measure the general public's
   attitudes towards mental health conditions.},

Title = {News and social media coverage is associated with more downloads and
   citations of manuscripts that focus on substance use},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {218},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Background: A variety of substance use-related topics are discussed in
   the public discourse; however, it is unknown how public discussion of
   published substance-related findings relates to manuscript downloads and
   citations. This manuscript examines how traditional and social media
   coverage of published findings about substance use affects downloads and
   scientific citations.
   Methods: Altmetric and bibliographic information was obtained for
   manuscripts published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence between 2018 and
   2019 (n = 943). Associations were examined between news and social media
   coverage (i.e., Twitter, Facebook) in relation to number of manuscript
   downloads and number of citations. This was done in a bivariable manner
   and in a multivariable manner examining correlates of being in the top
   10th percentile of downloads and citations.
   Results: 73.3 \% of articles were shared on Twitter, 23.6 \% were shared
   on Facebook, and 13.9 \% were covered in news sources (with 4.0 \%
   receiving major media coverage). Epidemiology papers were among the most
   covered in the news, and e-cigarette review papers were among the most
   downloaded. News and social media coverage were positively associated
   with number of downloads and citations in bivariable models and with
   achieving the top 10 \% of downloads and citations in multivariable
   models (ps < .001). Publishing a press release was associated with
   higher likelihood of receiving additional news coverage (aPR = 7.85, 95
   \% CI: 5.15-11.97).
   Conclusions: Traditional and social media coverage of manuscripts
   focusing on substance use are associated with more downloads and
   citations. Researchers should consider sharing findings not only to
   increase downloads and citations but also to educate the general public.},

Title = {The Role of Social Media on the Research Productivity of Neurosurgeons
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {E1419-E1425},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic committees of all countries restricted
   face-to-face interactions. This study aimed to determine how the
   pandemic changed the research output for many neurosurgeons while
   highlighting how social media may have been used as a contactless
   platform to maintain research productivity during these times.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, 24-item, and non-randomized
   online survey was applied worldwide, and shared using social media
   platforms and emails. The questions mainly focused on comparing the
   results of the pre-pandemic period to the pandemic period (after March
   2020).
   RESULTS: A total of 202 respondents from 60 different countries
   responded to the survey. Interest in neurosurgical education increased
   from 24\% to 76\%, while the topic of epidemiology gained interest from
   28\% to 72\% when the pre-pandemic era was compared to the pandemic era.
   Preference for prospective studies decreased from 66\% to 34\%, while
   interest in retrospective studies increased from 39\% to 61\%. In
   evaluating publication types, the preference for reviews increased from
   36\% to 64\%. Sixty-two percent of the respondents stated they had
   concerns over delays in individual contributions/lack of accountability.
   These concerns were followed by problems with theft of intellectual
   property/data and authorship disputes. Forty-one percent believed that
   the support of extra hands on a load-heavy project was the most powerful
   benefit of social media collaboration. Those who reported increased
   publications during the pandemic were also more likely to collaborate
   using social media (P = 0.030).
   CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, social media collaborations helped
   increase research output for neurosurgeons.},

Abstract = {Evidence on whether social media use is associated with poor mental
   health and stress remains mixed and controversial. It is suggested that
   this effect may vary according to individual differences. Emotional
   intelligence (EI) is considered a protective resource that can buffer
   the effects of stressors in certain contexts. We examine whether this
   protective effect extends to the experience of social media stress. 201
   young adults (mean age 26.12; 83.6\% female) completed measures of EI
   (trait; ability), social media stress (SMS), anxiety, depression and
   wellbeing. SMS related to poorer mental health (symptoms and wellbeing)
   whilst higher EI was linked to reduced levels of SMS and better mental
   health. Data show the relationship between SMS and depression is
   moderated by trait (not ability) EI, such that those with lower levels
   of trait EI, who experience high levels of SMS, report higher levels of
   depression symptoms compared to those with higher TEL Implications and
   directions for research are explored.},

Journal = {ONE HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent outbreaks of Avian Influenza across Europe have highlighted the
   potential for syndromic surveillance systems that consider other modes
   of data, namely social media. This study investigates the feasibility of
   using social media, primarily Twitter, to monitor illness outbreaks such
   as avian flu. Using temporal, geographical, and correlation analyses, we
   investigated the association between avian influenza tweets and
   officially verified cases in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022.
   Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate Moran's I analysis and time
   series analysis, were among the methodologies used. The findings show a
   weak, statistically insignificant rela-tionship between the number of
   tweets and confirmed cases in a temporal context, implying that relying
   simply on social media data for surveillance may be insufficient. The
   spatial analysis provided insights into the overlaps between confirmed
   cases and tweet locations, shedding light on regionally targeted
   interventions during out-breaks. Although social media can be useful for
   understanding public sentiment and concerns during outbreaks, it must be
   combined with traditional surveillance methods and official data sources
   for a more accurate and comprehensive approach. Improved data mining
   techniques and real-time analysis can improve outbreak detection and
   response even further. This study underscores the need of having a
   strong surveillance system in place to properly monitor and manage
   disease outbreaks and protect public health.},

Abstract = {To better understand factors influencing infectious agent dispersal
   within a livestock population information is needed on the nature and
   frequency of contacts between farm enterprises. This study uses social
   network analysis to describe the contact network within a vertically
   integrated broiler poultry enterprise to identify the potential
   horizontal and vertical transmission pathways for Salmonella spp. Nodes
   (farms, sheds, production facilities) were identified and the daily
   movement of commodities (eggs, birds, feed, litter) and people between
   nodes were extracted from routinely kept farm records. Three time
   periods were examined in detail, 1-and 8-and 17-weeks of the production
   cycle and contact networks were described for all movements, and by
   commodity and production type. All nodes were linked by at least one
   movement during the study period but network density was low indicating
   that all potential pathways between nodes did not exist. Salmonella spp.
   transmission via vertical or horizontal pathways can only occur along
   directed pathways when those pathways are present. Only two locations
   (breeder or feed nodes) were identified where the transmission of a
   single Salmonella spp. clone could theoretically percolate through the
   network to the broiler or processing nodes. Only the feed transmission
   pathway directly connected all parts of the network. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {PrEP in India's HIV Prevention Policy in the Era of Social Media and Sex
   Positivity},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Introduction: The global revolution of online social media and
   connectivity had a tremendous effect on sexual behavior in both
   developed and developing countries. This global change is influencing
   the societal structure and existing social principles. Moreover, it has
   a significant impact on the epidemiology of different infectious
   diseases, especially HIV.
   Discussion: India is one of the most diverse democratic countries that
   has undergone a social-cultural transition in the last decade. However,
   having the second-highest HIV infection rate in the world, India does
   not have any other new prevention tools in their national HIV prevention
   strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a boon of HIV prevention
   widely used in different countries, is still not implemented in India.
   The concept of ``Digital India{''} by the Government of India is giving
   wide access of internet to the people of India. Furthermore, people are
   exposed to social media, and that is impacting their sex seeking
   behavior. Interestingly, recent legal changes in India promotes sex
   positivity. It also calls for introspection on existing HIV preventive
   strategies.
   Conclusion: Given the current scenario of PrEP and other existing
   preventive measurements of HIV, further research is needed to determine
   the acceptance and efficacy of PrEP and improve engagement in care for
   individuals in India. Various international studies recommend effective
   implication of PrEP to reduce the rate and economic burden of HIV
   infection.},

Abstract = {Sentiment analysis has been increasingly used to analyze online social
   media data such as tweets and health forum posts. However, previous
   studies often adopted existing, general-purpose sentiment analyzers
   developed in non-healthcare domains, without assessing their validity
   and without customizing them for the specific study context. In this
   work, we empirically evaluated three general-purpose sentiment analyzers
   popularly used in previous studies (Stanford Core NLP Sentiment
   Analysis, TextBlob, and VADER), based on two online health datasets and
   a general-purpose dataset as the baseline. We illustrate that none of
   these general-purpose sentiment analyzers were able to produce
   satisfactory classifications of sentiment polarity. Further, these
   sentiment analyzers generated inconsistent results when applied to the
   same dataset, and their performance varies to a great extent across the
   two health datasets. Significant future work is therefore needed to
   develop context-specific sentiment analysis tools for analyzing online
   health data.},

Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate behavioural intentions to receive free
   and self-paid COVID-19 vaccinations (BICV-F and BICV-SP) among Chinese
   university students if the vaccine was 80\% effective with rare mild
   side effects, to examine their associations with social media exposures
   and peer discussions regarding COVID-19 vaccination, and to explore the
   mediational role of perceived information sufficiency about COVID-19
   vaccination. An online anonymous survey (N = 6922) was conducted in
   November 2020 in five Chinese provinces. Logistic regression and path
   analysis were adopted. The prevalence of BICV-F and BICV-SP were 78.1\%
   and 57.7\%. BICV-F was positively associated with the frequencies of
   passive social media exposure (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.32, P <
   0.001), active social media interaction (AOR = 1.13, P < 0.001) and peer
   discussions (AOR = 1.17, P < 0.001). Indirect effects of the three
   factors on BICV-F via perceived information sufficiency were all
   significant (P < 0.001). The direct effect of active social media
   interaction on BICV-F was significantly negative (P < 0.001). Similar
   associations/mediations were observed for BICV-SP. The COVID-19
   vaccination intention of Chinese university students needs improvement.
   Boosting social media exposures and peer discussions may raise students'
   perceived information sufficiency and subsequently increase their
   vaccination intention. Considering the potential negative effect of
   active social media interaction, caution is needed when using social
   media to promote COVID-19 vaccination.},

Abstract = {In this study, a procedure is proposed for surveying public opinion from
   big social media domain-specific textual data to minimize the
   difficulties associated with modeling public behavior. Strategies for
   labeling posts relevant to a topic are discussed. A two-part framework
   is proposed in which semiautomatic labeling is applied to a small subset
   of posts, referred to as the ``seed{''} in further text. This seed is
   used as bases for semi-supervised labeling of the rest of the data. The
   hypothesis is that the proposed method will achieve better labeling
   performance than existing classification models when applied to small
   amounts of labeled data. The seed is labeled using posts of users with a
   known and consistent view on the topic. A semi-supervised multiclass
   prediction model labels the remaining data iteratively. In each
   iteration, it adds context-label pairs to the training set if
   softmax-based label probabilities are above the threshold. The proposed
   method is characterized on four datasets by comparison to the three
   popular text modeling algorithms (n-grams + tfidf, fastText, VDCNN) for
   different sizes of labeled seeds (5,000 and 50,000 posts) and for
   several label-prediction significance thresholds. Our proposed
   semi-supervised method outperformed alternative algorithms by capturing
   additional contexts from the unlabeled data. The accuracy of the
   algorithm was increasing by (3-10\%) when using a larger fraction of
   data as the seed. For the smaller seed, lower label probability
   threshold was clearly a better choice, while for larger seeds no
   predominant threshold was observed. The proposed framework, using
   fastText library for efficient text classification and representation
   learning, achieved the best results for a smaller seed, while VDCNN
   wrapped in the proposed framework achieved the best results for the
   bigger seed. The performance was negatively influenced by the number of
   classes. Finally, the model was applied to characterize a biased dataset
   of opinions related to gun control/rights advocacy. The proposed
   semi-automatic seed labeling is used to label 8,448 twitter posts of 171
   advocates for guns control/rights. On this application, our approach
   performed better than existing models and it achieves 96.5\% accuracy
   and 0.68 F1 score.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public
   health professionals work and communicate. Over a very short time span,
   remote working arrangements have become the norm, and meetings have
   shifted online. Physical distancing measures have accelerated a trend
   toward digital communication and social exchange. At the same time, the
   work of epidemiologists has been held under a magnifying glass by
   journalists, governments and the general public, in a way not previously
   seen. With social media becoming an integral part of our society over
   the last decade, Twitter is now a key communication tool and platform
   for social networking among epidemiologists (\#EpiTwitter). In this
   article, we reflect on the use of Twitter by field epidemiologists and
   public health microbiologists for rapid professional exchange, public
   communication of science and professional development during the
   pandemic and the associated risks. For those field epidemiologists new
   to social media, we discuss how Twitter can be used in a variety of
   ways, both at their home institutions and during field deployment. These
   include information dissemination, science communication and public
   health advocacy, professional development, networking and experience
   exchange. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined (1) whether intense and problematic social
   media use (SMU) were independently associated with adolescent
   well-being; (2) whether these associations varied by the country-level
   prevalence of intense and problematic SMU; and (3) whether differences
   in the country-level prevalence of intense and problematic SMU were
   related to differences in mobile Internet access.
   Methods: Individual-level data came from 154,981 adolescents (mean(age)
   = 13.5) from 29 countries that participated in the 2017/2018 Health
   Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Intense SMU was
   measured by the time spent on social media, whereas problematic SMU was
   defined by symptoms of addiction to social media. Mental (life
   satisfaction and psychological complaints), school (school satisfaction
   and perceived school pressure), and social (family support and friend
   support) well-being were assessed. Country-level data came from
   aggregated individual-level data and data from the Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Internet access.
   Results: Two-level regression analyses indicated that in countries with
   a lower prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported lower levels
   of life satisfaction and family support and more psychological
   complaints than nonintense users. In contrast, in countries with a
   higher prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported higher levels
   of family support and life satisfaction than 0nonintense users, and
   similar levels of psychological complaints. In all countries, intense
   users reported more friend support than nonintense users. The findings
   regarding problematic SMU were more consistent: In all countries,
   problematic users reported lower well-being on all domains than
   nonproblematic users. Observed differences in country-level prevalence
   rates of intense and problematic SMU could not be explained by mobile
   Internet access.
   Conclusions: Adolescents reporting problematic SMU are particularly at
   risk of lower well-being. In many countries, intense SMU may be a
   normative adolescent behavior that contributes positively to specific
   domains of their well-being. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by abnormal eating habits and
   obsessive thought about food, weight, shape, and body image. EDs are
   experienced by a significant portion of our population. Social media is
   identified as a possible source of influence for EDs, and there is
   growing evidence of a large amount of ED-related discussions on the Web
   via social media platforms, such as Twitter. With this growing trend,
   automatic content analysis for EDs is becoming increasingly important.
   To date, there does not exist any comprehensive benchmark ED lexicon to
   identify ED-related conversations that would, in turn, facilitate these
   content analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
   generating a lexicon base for ED language, called EDBase. The method
   starts with collecting over 3.7 million ED-focused tweets. In order to
   semantically represent potential ED terminology in a vector space, an ED
   word embedding model (EDModel) is trained. Then we develop a novel
   multi-seeded hierarchical density-based algorithm with contrasting
   corpora for ED lexicon expansion. The EDModel is queried by the proposed
   lexicon expansion algorithm to expand the seed terms to a comprehensive
   lexicon base. Our EDBase consists of a (further expandable) list of 3794
   high-quality ED terms, quantified by an ED score, and linked to their
   parent terms. The proposed method significantly outperforms all existing
   alternative baseline methods and models by over 25\% in terms of
   precision and 1500 in terms of true positives. This research is expected
   to be impactful in the health data science and healthcare community.},

Title = {Prescribing Associated with High-Risk Opioid Exposures Among Non-cancer
   Chronic Users of Opioid Analgesics: a Social Network Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE},

Volume = {34},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe continued rise in fatalities from opioid analgesics
   despite a steady decline in the number of individual prescriptions
   directing >= 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day may be
   explained by patient exposures to redundant prescriptions from multiple
   prescribers.ObjectivesWe evaluated prescribers' specialty and social
   network characteristics associated with high-risk opioid exposures
   resulting from single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.DesignRetrospective cohort
   study.ParticipantsA cohort of prescribers with opioid analgesic
   prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users in an Illinois
   Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016.Main MeasuresPer prescriber
   rates of single-prescriber high-daily-dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.Key ResultsFor 2280 beneficiaries,
   36,798 opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers.
   Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\%
   of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted
   for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions
   (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following
   specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared
   to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence
   interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and
   surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis
   identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume
   pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of
   predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians.
   Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected
   sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk
   exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's
   periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing
   than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing
   discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated
   practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and
   integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to
   specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential
   policy implications.},

Title = {Social media use as a predictor of handwashing during a pandemic:
   evidence from COVID-19 in Malaysia},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Abstract = {Although handwashing is an effective way to prevent infections, there is
   scarce evidence on predictors of handwashing during a pandemic. This
   paper aims to identify behavioural and demographic predictors of
   handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020
   regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing
   contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social
   media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or
   more children. However, for males without children, social media use was
   negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not
   significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time
   spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only
   for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of
   handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than
   three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of
   children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social
   media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive
   predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a
   predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing,
   and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication
   during a pandemic - particularly through social media. Further, more
   conventional predictors like gender and number of children exhibit
   contingency effects with social media use.},

Abstract = {Social media enables medical professionals and authorities to share,
   disseminate, monitor, and manage health-related information digitally
   through online communities such as Twitter and Facebook. Simultaneously,
   artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital
   capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict
   problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the
   patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such
   improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI
   raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations
   obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the
   responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper
   examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from
   analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The
   exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible
   AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage
   of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing
   initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer
   research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and
   limitations of the study have been discussed.},

Title = {Social media use and cannabis vaping initiation among US youth},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {249},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: Youth cannabis vaping has increased in recent years, and
   there is growing evidence of cannabis vaping content on social media.
   This study investigated if social media use is associated with the
   initiation of cannabis vaping among US youth, using the youth dataset
   from Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Waves 4
   (2016-2018) and 5 (2018-2019). Methods: Using youth respondents who
   never vaped cannabis at Wave 4 (N=8357), we conducted a multivariable
   logistic regression analysis on initiation of cannabis vaping at Wave 5
   (i.e., ever-vaped cannabis) by frequency of social media use, after
   controlling for covariates (e.g., sociodemographic, other tobacco and
   substance use). Results: In this analytic sample, 66.5\% reported daily
   social media use, 16.2\% reported non-daily and 17.3\% reported `not
   having a social media account' or `no social media use' at Wave 4.
   Further, 14.0\% (n=1183) initiated cannabis vaping at Wave 5. In the
   multivariable logistic regression model, daily social media use (vs.
   never use; aOR=2.68; 95\% CI=2.05, 3.49) and non-daily social media use
   (vs. never use; aOR=1.54; 95\% CI=1.14, 2.09) at Wave 4 were associated
   with cannabis vaping initiation at Wave 5. Conclusions: Our evidence
   suggests that social media use by youth is associated with cannabis
   vaping initiation among youth in subsequent years, even after
   controlling for other risk factors. Consistent surveillance and
   regulation of cannabis vaping-related content on social media, as well
   as prevention efforts, including counter -messaging on social media
   about the potential harms of cannabis vaping, are critically needed.},

Abstract = {Given insufficient prospective evidence for relationships between social
   media use and well-being among adults, the present study examined the
   temporal sequence between social media use and psychological distress
   and life satisfaction, and explored age and gender differences. A
   representative sample of adults (N = 7331; 62.4\% women; M-age = 51.94;
   SD = 13.48; 15-94 years) were surveyed annually across four waves.
   Cross-lagged panel models demonstrated bidirectional relationships
   between social media use and well-being. Higher psychological distress
   and lower life satisfaction predicted higher social media use more
   strongly than the reverse direction, with effects particularly
   pronounced for the impact of psychological distress. Although the
   patterns of findings were relatively consistent across age and gender,
   results suggested that women and middle- and older-aged adults
   experience detrimental effects of social media use on well-being, which
   may drive subsequent increased use of social media. The bidirectional
   relationships suggest that adults who experience psychological distress
   or lower life satisfaction may seek to use social media as a way to
   alleviate poor well-being. However, paradoxically, this maladaptive
   coping mechanism appears to drive increased social media use which in
   turn can exacerbate poor well-being. Clinicians should be aware of these
   bidirectional relationships and work with clients towards replacing
   ineffective strategies with more helpful coping approaches. As this
   study used a simplistic measure of social media use, future research
   should address this limitation and explore nuanced relationships
   afforded by assessing specific social media activities or exposure to
   certain types of content.},

Abstract = {In this modern era, infectious diseases, such as H1N1, SARS, and Ebola,
   are spreading much faster than any time in history. Efficient approaches
   are therefore desired to monitor and track the diffusion of these deadly
   epidemics. Traditional computational epidemiology models are able to
   capture the disease spreading trends through contact network, however,
   one unable to provide timely updates via real-world data. In contrast,
   techniques focusing on emerging social media platforms can collect and
   monitor real-time disease data, but do not provide an understanding of
   the underlying dynamics of ailment propagation. To achieve efficient and
   accurate real-time disease prediction, the framework proposed in this
   paper combines the strength of social media mining and computational
   epidemiology. Specifically, individual health status is first learned
   from user's online posts through Bayesian inference, disease parameters
   are then extracted for the computational models at population-level, and
   the outputs of computational epidemiology model are inversely fed into
   social media data based models for further performance improvement. In
   various experiments, our proposed model outperforms current disease
   forecasting approaches with better accuracy and more stability.},

Title = {The Relationships Between Social Media and Human Papillomavirus
   Awareness and Knowledge: Cross-sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
   transmitted infection. HPV can infect both females and males, and it can
   cause many cancers, including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and
   penile cancers. HPV vaccination rates are lower than vaccination rates
   within other national vaccination programs, despite its importance.
   Research literature indicates that people obtain health-related
   information from internet sources and social media; however, the
   association between such health-seeking behavior on social media and
   HPV-related behaviors has not been consistently demonstrated in the
   literature. Objective: This study aims to examine the association
   between social media usage and HPV knowledge and HPV awareness. Methods:
   This study analyzed public health data collected through the Health
   Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) conducted by the US National
   Cancer Institute. The analysis used data collected in 2020; in total,
   2948 responses were included in the analysis. Six HPV-related questions
   were used to identify HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, and HPV
   knowledge about HPV-related cancers. Four questions about social media
   usage and one question about online health information-seeking behavior
   were used to analyze the associations between social media usage and
   HPV-related behaviors. Initially, six logistic regressions were
   conducted using replicate weights. Based on the results, significant
   factors were included in a second set of regression analyses that also
   included demographic variables. Results: About half of the respondents
   were aware of HPV (68.40\%), the HPV vaccine (64.04\%), and the
   relationship between HPV and cervical cancer (48.00\%). However, fewer
   respondents were knowledgeable about the relationships between HPV and
   penile cancer (19.18\%), anal cancer (18.33\%), and oral cancer
   (19.86\%). Although social media usage is associated with HPV awareness,
   HPV vaccine awareness, and knowledge of cervical cancer, these
   associations were not significant after adjusting for demographic
   variables. Those less likely to report HPV awareness and knowledge
   included older participants, males, those with a household income of
   less than US \$20,000, those with a formal education equal to or less
   than high school, or those who resided in a household where adults are
   not fluent in English. Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic
   variables, social media use was not related to HPV knowledge and
   awareness, and survey respondents were generally not aware that HPV can
   lead to specific types of cancer, other than cervical cancer. These
   results suggest that perhaps a lack of high-quality information on
   social media may impede HPV awareness and knowledge. Efforts to educate
   the public about HPV via social media might be improved by using
   techniques like storytelling or infographics, especially targeting
   vulnerable populations, such as older participants, males, those with
   low incomes, those with less formal education, or those who reside in
   the United States but are not fluent in English.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Depression is increasingly common among US adolescents; the
   extent to which social media exposure contributes to this increase
   remains controversial.
   Methods: We used Monitoring the Future data from 8th and 10th grade
   students (n = 74,472), 2009-2017, to assess the relationship between
   daily social media use and depressive symptoms. Self-reported depressive
   symptom score (range: 4-20) was assessed continuously using a
   log-transformed outcome and at varying cut scores with logistic
   regression analyses. First, these outcomes were examined overall,
   comparing adolescents using social media daily to adolescents who were
   not. We then estimated predicted depressive symptom scores using 26
   predictors in order to establish underlying depression risk. We
   partitioned students into depression risk quintiles to control for
   confounding due to underlying depression risk and examine heterogeneity
   in the association between social media use and depressive symptoms.
   Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of results with
   different configurations of the predicted score model, and overall
   associations were examined in two-year groups to identify differences in
   effects.
   Results: For girls, in adjusted risk-stratified analysis, daily social
   media use was not associated with high (vs. low) depressive symptoms.
   For boys, results were inconsistent, suggesting a protective effect of
   daily social media use at some cut scores. Results were consistent
   across sensitivity analyses, and any potential harmful effects appear to
   be limited to 2009-2010, limiting the evidence supporting social media
   as a current risk factor for depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Among US adolescents, daily social media use is not a
   strong or consistent risk factor for depressive symptoms. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the relationship between frequent social
   media use , subsequent mental health in a representative sample of US
   adolescents. Also investigated were sex differences in multiyear growth
   trajectories of mental health problem internalization relative to social
   media use. Methods: Four waves (2013-2018) of nationally representative,
   longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health data were
   analyzed. A total of 5,114 US adolescents aged 12-14 years at baseline
   had repeated data across all waves. Statistical analysis involved
   testing a series of sequential-weighted single-group and multi-group
   latent growth curve models using R version 3.6.2. Results: Of the 5,114
   respondents, 2,491 were girls (48.7\%). The percentage of frequent
   social media use was 26.4\% at Wave 1 and 69.1\% at Wave 4 for boys
   compared to 38.3\% and 80.6\% for girls (p < .001). Boys showed an
   improving (-0.218, p = .005) but girls showed a deteriorating linear
   trend (0.229, p = .028) for mental health at the full multigroup latent
   growth curve model. Social media use accounted for mental health
   conditions across Waves 1-3 for boys (ps<.01) but only at Wave 1 for
   girls (p = .035). With the addition of the social media use variable
   alone, model fit dramatically improved , residual variances in growth
   patterns (i.e., random effect) became nonsignificant for boys.
   Substantial sex differences existed in baseline status, directionality,
   and shape of mental health growth trajectories as well as interplay of
   social media use with other factors. Discussion: Findings of the study
   suggest that frequent social media use is associated with poorer
   subsequent mental health for adolescents.(c) 2021 Society for Adolescent

Abstract = {Purpose: The American College of Epidemiology held its 2021 Annual
   Meeting virtually, September 8-10, with a conference theme of `From Womb
   to Tomb: Insights from Health Emergencies'. The American College of
   Epidemiology Ethics Committee hosted a symposium session in recognition
   of the ethical and social challenges brought to light by the coronavirus
   disease 2019 pandemic and on the occasion of the publication of the
   third edition of the classic text, Ethics and Epidemiology. The American
   College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee invited the book editor and
   contributing authors to present at the symposium session titled `Current
   Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology.' The purpose of this paper is
   to further highlight the ethical challenges and presentations.Methods:
   Three speakers with expertise in ethics, health law, health policy,
   global health, health information technology, and translational research
   in epidemiology and public health were selected to present on the social
   and ethical issues in the current landscape. Dr. S Coughlin presented on
   the `Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology', Dr. L Beskow presented
   on `Ethical Challenges in Genetic Epidemiology', and Dr. K Goodman
   presented on the `Ethics of Health Informatics'.Results: New digital
   sources of data and technologies are driving the ethical challenges and
   opportunities in epidemiology and public health as it relates to the
   three emerging topic areas identified: (1) digital epidemiology, (2)
   genetic epidemiology, and (3) health informatics. New complexities such
   as the reliance on social media to control infectious disease outbreaks
   and the introduction of computing advancements are requiring
   re-evaluation of traditional bioethical frameworks for epidemiology
   research and public health practice. We identified several cross-cutting
   ethical and social issues related to informed consent, benefits, risks
   and harms, and privacy and confidentiality and summarized these
   alongside more nuanced ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias,
   group harms related to data (mis)representation, risks of
   misinformation, return of genomic research results, maintaining data
   security, and data sharing. We offered an integrated synthesis of the
   stages of epidemiology research planning and conduct with the ethical
   issues that are most relevant in these emerging topic areas.Conclusions:
   New realities exist for epidemiology and public health as professional
   groups who are faced with addressing population health, and especially
   given the recent pandemic and the widespread use of digital tools and
   technologies. Many ethical issues can be understood in the context of
   existing ethical frameworks; however, they have yet to be clearly
   identified or connected with the new technical and methodological
   applications of digital tools and technologies currently in use for
   epidemiology research and public health practice. To address current
   ethical challenges, we offered a synthesis of traditional ethical
   principles in public health science alongside more nuanced ethical
   considerations for emerging technologies and aligned these with
   lifecycle stages of epidemiology research. By critically reflecting on
   the impact of new digital sources of data and technologies on
   epidemiology research and public health practice, specifically in the
   control of infectious outbreaks, we offered insights on cultivating
   these new areas of professional growth while striving to improve
   population health.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   Characteristics of Regular and Nonregular Social Media Users in Nurses'

Abstract = {With advances in natural language processing and machine learning,
   researchers are leveraging social media as a low-cost, low-burden method
   for measuring various psychosocial factors. However, it is unclear
   whether information derived from social media is generalizable to
   broader populations, especially middle-aged and older adults. Using data
   on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; n =
   49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics,
   health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular
   and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park,
   California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (phi) coefficients
   (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds
   ratios with 95\% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between
   regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this
   large sample, effect sizes were mostly ``very small{''} (conventionally
   defined as phi or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: mean regular users =
   19 vs. mean(nonregular users) = 19 (d = -0.03); physical activity:
   mean(regular users) = 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week
   vs. mean(nonregular users) = 24 MET-hours/week (d = 0.01)). Some factors
   had slightly larger differences for regular users versus nonregular
   users (e.g., depression: 28\% vs. 23\% (phi = 0.05); odds ratio = 1.27
   (95\% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.33); obesity: 34\% vs. 26\% (phi =
   0.07); odds ratio = 1.42 (95\% confidence interval: 1.36, 1.48)).
   Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular
   users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly
   worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms. In future
   research, investigators should evaluate other demographic groups.},

Title = {A New Method to Extract Health-Related Quality of Life Data From Social
   Media Testimonies: Algorithm Development and Validation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Background: Monitoring social media has been shown to be a useful means
   to capture patients' opinions and feelings about medical issues, ranging
   from diseases to treatments. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a
   useful indicator of overall patients' health, which can be captured
   online.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe a social media listening
   algorithm able to detect the impact of diseases or treatments on
   specific dimensions of HRQoL based on posts written by patients in
   social media and forums.
   Methods: Using a web crawler, 19 forums in France were harvested, and
   messages related to patients' experience with disease or treatment were
   specifically collected. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) and EQ-5D
   (Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions) HRQoL surveys were mixed and adapted
   for a tailored social media listening system. This was carried out to
   better capture the variety of expression on social media, resulting in 5
   dimensions of the HRQoL, which are physical, psychological,
   activity-based, social, and financial. Models were trained using
   cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Oversampling was used
   to increase the infrequent dimension: after annotation, SMOTE (synthetic
   minority oversampling technique) was used to balance the proportions of
   the dimensions among messages.
   Results: The training set was composed of 1399 messages, randomly taken
   from a batch of 20,000 health-related messages coming from forums. The
   algorithm was able to detect a general impact on HRQoL (sensitivity of
   0.83 and specificity of 0.74), a physical impact (0.67 and 0.76), a
   psychic impact (0.82 and 0.60), an activity-related impact (0.73 and
   0.78), a relational impact (0.73 and 0.70), and a financial impact (0.79
   and 0.74).
   Conclusions: The development of an innovative method to extract health
   data from social media as real time assessment of patients' HRQoL is
   useful to a patient-centered medical care. As a source of real-world
   data, social media provide a complementary point of view to understand
   patients' concerns and unmet needs, as well as shedding light on how
   diseases and treatments can be a burden in their daily lives.},

Abstract = {Objectives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred
   online, through social media. This study aimed to provide patient
   perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with
   rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based
   patient-generated health data (PGHD).
   Methods. A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by
   people with RMDs was extracted between 1 March and 12 July 2020 and
   examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that
   mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2)
   and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint)
   conditions (ankylosing spondylitis, RA, PsA, lupus/SLE and gout).
   Results. The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs
   across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of
   the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (i) lack of understanding of
   SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (ii) critical changes in health behaviour; (iii)
   challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare
   professionals; (iv) difficulties with access to medical care; (v)
   negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (vi)
   issues around work participation; (vii) negative effects of the media;
   and (viii) awareness-raising.
   Conclusion. The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data
   source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with
   RMDs. The platform provided `early signals' of potentially critical
   health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the
   real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs,
   facilitate communication and inform clinical practice decisions.},

Title = {Sample Bias in Web-Based Patient-Generated Health Data of Dutch Patients
   With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor: Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Increasingly, social media is being recognized as a
   potential resource for patient-generated health data, for example, for
   pharmacovigilance. Although the representativeness of the web-based
   patient population is often noted as a concern, studies in this field
   are limited.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the sample bias of
   patient-centered social media in Dutch patients with gastrointestinal
   stromal tumor (GIST).
   Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in the Netherlands
   among 328 patients with GIST diagnosed 2-13 years ago to investigate
   their digital communication use with fellow patients. A logistic
   regression analysis was used to analyze clinical and demographic
   differences between forum users and nonusers.
   Results: Overall, 17.9\% (59/328) of survey respondents reported having
   contact with fellow patients via social media. Moreover, 78\% (46/59) of
   forum users made use of GIST patient forums. We found no statistically
   significant differences for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time
   since diagnosis between forum users (n=46) and nonusers (n=273). Patient
   forum users did differ significantly in (self-reported) treatment phase
   from nonusers (P=.001). Of the 46 forum users, only 2 (4\%) were cured
   and not being monitored; 3 (7\%) were on adjuvant, curative treatment;
   19 (41\%) were being monitored after adjuvant treatment; and 22 (48\%)
   were on palliative treatment. In contrast, of the 273 patients who did
   not use disease-specific forums to communicate with fellow patients, 56
   (20.5\%) were cured and not being monitored, 31 (11.3\%) were on
   curative treatment, 139 (50.9\%) were being monitored after treatment,
   and 42 (15.3\%) were on palliative treatment. The odds of being on a
   patient forum were 2.8 times as high for a patient who is being
   monitored compared with a patient that is considered cured. The odds of
   being on a patient forum were 1.9 times as high for patients who were on
   curative (adjuvant) treatment and 10 times as high for patients who were
   in the palliative phase compared with patients who were considered
   cured. Forum users also reported a lower level of social functioning
   (84.8 out of 100) than nonusers (93.8 out of 100; P=.008).
   Conclusions: Forum users showed no particular bias on the most important
   demographic variables of age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time since
   diagnosis. This may reflect the narrowing digital divide.
   Overrepresentation and underrepresentation of patients with GIST in
   different treatment phases on social media should be taken into account
   when sourcing patient forums for patient-generated health data. A
   further investigation of the sample bias in other web-based patient
   populations is warranted.},

Abstract = {BackgroundOlder adults' engagement on social media may be a resource to
   reduce loneliness and improve mental health. Purpose: This study aimed
   to examine loneliness and social media use and its association with
   severe psychological distress among older adults and whether social
   media use moderated the association of loneliness on severe
   psychological distress among older adults.MethodsThis study is a
   secondary analysis of the 2019-2020 California Health Interview Survey.
   The Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (K6) assessed symptoms
   of psychological distress, with a K6 score \& GE; 13 associated with
   severe mental illness. Loneliness was measured using a revised Three
   Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) score. Multiple regression analyses were
   conducted to examine associations between loneliness and severe
   psychological distress.ResultsLoneliness, health status, and
   identification as Asian, remained strong predictors of severe
   psychological distress among older adults when adjusting for other
   factors. In bivariate analysis, high-frequent social media users, but
   did not remain significant when accounting for covariates. Social media
   use did not moderate the association between loneliness and severe
   psychological distress.ConclusionThis study underscores the significant
   impact of loneliness on poor mental health among older adults,
   emphasizing that while frequent social media use correlates with severe
   psychological distress, it may not alleviate the association of
   loneliness on poor mental health, thus highlighting the urgent need to
   address social isolation and promote genuine social connectedness,
   particularly among Asian older adults.},

Title = {Detection of emerging drugs involved in overdose via diachronic word
   embeddings of substances discussed on social media},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
Month = {2021 JUL},
Abstract = {Substances involved in overdose deaths have shifted over time and
   continue to undergo transition. Early detection of emerging drugs
   involved in overdose is a major challenge for traditional public health
   data systems. While novel social media data have shown promise, there is
   a continued need for robust natural language processing approaches that
   can identify emerging substances. Consequently, we developed a new
   metric, the relative similarity ratio, based on diachronic word
   embeddings to measure movement in the semantic proximity of individual
   substance words to `overdose' over time. Our analysis of 64,420,376
   drug-related posts made between January 2011 and December 2018 on
   Reddit, the largest online forum site, reveals that this approach
   successfully identified fentanyl, the most significant emerging
   substance in the overdose epidemic, >1 year earlier than traditional
   public health data systems. Use of diachronic word embeddings may enable
   improved identification of emerging substances involved in drug
   overdose, thereby improving the timeliness of prevention and treatment
   activities.},

Title = {Adolescent alcohol use: use of social network analysis and
   cross-classified multilevel modeling to examine peer group, school, and
   neighborhood-level influences},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an important
   role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors. Methodological advances permit
   simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and
   joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and
   studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include
   contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data;
   or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an
   eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual
   contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary
   parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta
   parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified
   models are also used to understand how each context may matter
   differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534
   females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and
   traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full
   and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups,
   schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%,
   respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do
   not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge
   as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in
   adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both
   methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model
   contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in
   youth alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention
   strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer
   networks.},

Title = {Social Media Engagement and Influenza Vaccination During the COVID-19
   Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of
   modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine
   hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza
   vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is
   required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real
   world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of
   health and medical information. Elucidating the association between
   social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may
   be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19.
   Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social
   media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association
   with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future
   web-associated vaccination campaigns.
   Methods: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over
   social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected
   during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years
   and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social
   media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior;
   health-related information searching, its reliability, and its
   influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate
   descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate
   analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important
   attributes associated with vaccination compliance.
   Results: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207
   were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were
   female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central
   Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a
   salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8\%)
   were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media.
   Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in
   high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates.
   The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social
   media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about
   influenza.
   Conclusions: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with
   seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of
   noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health
   care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This
   is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19.
   Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health
   communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media.
   Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and
   personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination
   rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.},

Abstract = {Background:Social media platforms have emerged as a valuable data source
   for public health research and surveillance. Monitoring of social media
   and user-generated data on the Web enables timely and inexpensive
   collection of information, overcoming time lag and cost of traditional
   health reporting systems. Objectives:This article identifies personally
   experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine reactions
   expressed on Twitter and validate the findings against an established
   vaccine reactions reporting system. Methods:We collected around 3
   million tweets from 1.4 million users between February 1, 2021, to
   January 31, 2022, using COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine reactions keyword
   lists. We performed topic modeling on a sample of the data and applied a
   modified F1 scoring technique to identify a topic that best
   differentiated vaccine-related personal health mentions. We then
   manually annotated 4,000 of the records from this topic, which were used
   to train a transformer-based classifier to identify likely personally
   experienced vaccine reactions. Applying the trained classifier to the
   entire data set allowed us to select records we could use to quantify
   potential vaccine side effects. Adverse events following immunization
   (AEFI) referred to in these records were compared with those reported to
   the state of Victoria's spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system,
   SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the
   Community).Results The most frequently mentioned potential vaccine
   reactions generally aligned with SAEFVIC data. Notable exceptions were
   increased Twitter reporting of bleeding-related AEFI and allergic
   reactions, and more frequent SAEFVIC reporting of cardiac AEFI.
   Conclusion:Social media conversations are a potentially valuable
   supplementary data source for detecting vaccine adverse event mentions.
   Monitoring of online observations about new vaccine-related personal
   health experiences has the capacity to provide early warnings about
   emerging vaccine safety issues.},

Title = {Is more always better? Exploring field survey and social media
   indicators of quality of urban greenspace, in relation to health},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the growing body of research exploring health benefits of
   greenspace, most studies treat greenspace as homogenous. There remains a
   need to focus on `quality' rather than quantity of greenspace. Quality
   may be a substantial determinant for use and experience within
   greenspaces and therefore may influence health and wellbeing benefits
   derived from that use. This small-area level ecological study was
   undertaken within the city of Sheffield, UK. Health data were drawn from
   the general health question within the 2011 UK Census. Greenspace
   quality was measured using field surveys by Sheffield City Council and a
   range of measures from social media (from Flickr and Twitter). The
   extent to which quality measures extracted from social media were
   comparable to those from field surveys was explored to investigate
   whether they could proxy quality thus negating the requirement for
   resource intensive field surveys. The potential greenspace quality
   proxies from social media, however, showed low levels of correlation
   with quality measures from detailed field surveys. In exploring levels
   of health associated with greenspace quality - after adjustment for
   potential confounders - we found that greenspaces with lower quality, in
   terms of cleanliness, were associated with higher prevalence of
   self-reported poor health. The prevalence ratio of poor health for the
   quintile with the lowest cleanliness was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.00-1.18),
   compared against the quintile with the highest cleanliness. We found
   little evidence of association between social media indicators of
   quality and poor health. Our work indicates that cleanliness of
   greenspace may affect adversely the health of surrounding residents.
   Whilst the precise mechanism for this is not yet known it is suggested
   that lack of cleanliness produces feelings of discomfort and insecurity,
   discouraging greenspace usage and inhibiting accrual of potential health
   and well-being benefits associated with that usage. This has important
   implications for greenspace provision and management.},

Title = {Evaluating the predictability of medical conditions from social media
   posts},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {We studied whether medical conditions across 21 broad categories were
   predictable from social media content across approximately 20 million
   words written by 999 consenting patients. Facebook language
   significantly improved upon the prediction accuracy of demographic
   variables for 18 of the 21 disease categories; it was particularly
   effective at predicting diabetes and mental health conditions including
   anxiety, depression and psychoses. Social media data are a quantifiable
   link into the otherwise elusive daily lives of patients, providing an
   avenue for study and assessment of behavioral and environmental disease
   risk factors. Analogous to the genome, social media data linked to
   medical diagnoses can be banked with patients' consent, and an encoding
   of social media language can be used as markers of disease risk, serve
   as a screening tool, and elucidate disease epidemiology. In what we
   believe to be the first report linking electronic medical record data
   with social media data from consenting patients, we identified that
   patients' Facebook status updates can predict many health conditions,
   suggesting opportunities to use social media data to determine disease
   onset or exacerbation and to conduct social media-based health
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Social media use increased early in the Covid-19 pandemic, but little
   information is available about its impact. The present study examined
   associations of frequency of use of different social media and the
   motives for use with subsequent social well-being and mental health.
   Data were gathered on a nationwide sample of 843 Americans during the
   first wave of lockdowns and infections in mid-April 2020, and again five
   weeks later. Participants were adults ages 20 to 88 years old (M = 39.3
   years old) recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Controlling
   for age and gender, greater frequency of Facebook and video chat app use
   predicted higher levels social support but also higher levels of
   cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals and posttraumatic stress
   symptoms. Greater use of video chat apps also predicted less loneliness.
   Greater use of both Instagram and Snapchat predicted more anxiety and
   cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals. Greater use of Instagram
   also predicted higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Motives
   for use (e.g., connect with others, waste time/avoid responsibility,
   online video gaming with others) also differentially predicted social
   well-being and mental health. Results indicate that greater social media
   use early in the pandemic was often associated with more distress and
   lower levels of social well-being but, effects varied depending on
   types, frequency, and motivations for use. Overall, the study revealed
   that social media use related to social well-being and mental health in
   complex ways.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has increased social media engagement globally. This
   study examined the correlation between social media use and
   physical/mental health among university students, considering gender and
   academic year. Out of 146 responses, 119 were analyzed after excluding
   participants with pre-existing psychological conditions. Results showed
   a significant correlation between social media use and mental health for
   all participants (correlation coefficient = 0.30, p < 0.001), indicating
   a negative impact on mental health with increased use. Gender-specific
   analysis revealed a non-significant correlation among males (p = 0.21),
   while females exhibited a significant correlation (correlation
   coefficient = 0.32, p = 0.01), suggesting an adverse effect on their
   mental health. Regarding physical health, females displayed an even
   higher correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.40, p < 0.001),
   highlighting the negative influence of social media on their physical
   well-being. Conversely, no significant correlation was observed among
   males. Analyzing by academic year, both pre-clerkship and clerkship
   students showed a significant correlation between social media use and
   mental health (correlation coefficients of 0.26, p = 0.01, and 0.42, p =
   0.03, respectively). Similarly, a significant correlation was found
   between social media use and physical health among pre-clerkship
   students (correlation coefficient = 0.34, p = 0.001), but not among
   clerkship students. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the
   adverse impact of social media use on physical and mental health among
   university students, particularly among females and across different
   academic years. These findings underscore the importance of promoting
   healthy social media habits and raising awareness about the potential
   negative effects on well-being.},

Title = {Does the number of hours spent daily on social media have any
   correlation to the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms in Saudi Adults?},
Journal = {WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Pages = {47-55},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: There is substantial evidence that links usage of social
   media as being marginally associated with numerous harmful effects on
   the human body consisting of adverse symptoms differing in their
   manifestation and onset of action. These include including anxiety,
   depression, sleep deprivation, chronic fatigue, and functional
   gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). This study aimed to determine the
   relationship between the number of hours spent daily on social media and
   Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms in Saudi adults.
   Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among the Saudi adult
   population. The method of distribution was performed by providing a
   self-administered, semi-structured online questionnaire containing 16
   items designated as demographic information (i.e., age, gender, marital
   state, and residency), the prevalence of IBS, and frequency of social
   media usage.
   Results: Eight hundred and ten participants completed the survey (59.8\%
   females vs. 40.2\% males). The most common age group was 20-29 years
   (58.1\%). 43\% of participants recorded screen time of 6 hours or more,
   and 75.8\% had used social media for six years or more. The prevalence
   of participants who were positive for IBS symptoms was 41.2\%. In a
   multivariate regression model, female gender, associated chronic
   disease, and the use of Twitter were the significant independent
   predictors of IBS, but screen time did not predict the symptoms.
   Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, there was a high prevalence
   of IBS among the adult population living in Saudi Arabia. This study
   also demonstrated that the duration of social media use and the number
   of hours of screen time were not independently accounted for as
   predictors of IBS. Further research is needed to establish the link
   between IBS and the use of social media in the region.},

Title = {Social Media Impact of the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Safety
   Communication Messaging About Zolpidem: Mixed-Methods Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues drug safety
   communications (DSCs) to health care professionals, patients, and the
   public when safety issues emerge related to FDA-approved drug products.
   These safety messages are disseminated through social media to ensure
   broad uptake.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the social media
   dissemination of 2 DSCs released in 2013 for the sleep aid zolpidem.
   Methods: We used the MedWatcher Social program and the DataSift historic
   query tool to aggregate Twitter and Facebook posts from October 1, 2012
   through August 31, 2013, a period beginning approximately 3 months
   before the first DSC and ending 3 months after the second. Posts were
   categorized as (1) junk, (2) mention, and (3) adverse event (AE) based
   on a score between -0.2 (completely unrelated) to 1 (perfectly related).
   We also looked at Google Trends data and Wikipedia edits for the same
   time period. Google Trends search volume is scaled on a range of 0 to
   100 and includes ``Related queries{''} during the relevant time periods.
   An interrupted time series (ITS) analysis assessed the impact of DSCs on
   the counts of posts with specific mention of zolpidem-containing
   products. Chow tests for known structural breaks were conducted on data
   from Twitter, Facebook, and Google Trends. Finally, Wikipedia edits were
   pulled from the website's editorial history, which lists all revisions
   to a given page and the editor's identity.
   Results: In total, 174,286 Twitter posts and 59,641 Facebook posts met
   entry criteria. Of those, 16.63\% (28,989/174,286) of Twitter posts and
   25.91\% (15,453/59,641) of Facebook posts were labeled as junk and
   excluded. AEs and mentions represented 9.21\% (16,051/174,286) and
   74.16\% (129,246/174,286) of Twitter posts and 5.11\% (3,050/59,641) and
   68.98\% (41,138/59,641) of Facebook posts, respectively. Total daily
   counts of posts about zolpidem-containing products increased on Twitter
   and Facebook on the day of the first DSC; Google searches increased on
   the week of the first DSC. ITS analyses demonstrated variability but
   pointed to an increase in interest around the first DSC. Chow tests were
   significant (P<.0001) for both DSCs on Facebook and Twitter, but only
   the first DSC on Google Trends. Wikipedia edits occurred soon after each
   DSC release, citing news articles rather than the DSC itself and
   presenting content that needed subsequent revisions for accuracy.
   Conclusions: Social media offers challenges and opportunities for
   dissemination of the DSC messages. The FDA could consider strategies for
   more actively disseminating DSC safety information through social media
   platforms, particularly when announcements require updating. The FDA may
   also benefit from directly contributing content to websites like
   Wikipedia that are frequently accessed for drug-related information.},

Title = {Endangered Exotic Pets on Social Media in the Middle East: Presence and
   Impact},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: The exotic pet trade is impacted by social media via
   greater accessibility to photos and videos including these species and
   the increasing popularity of online animal marketplaces. The social
   media presence of public figures owning exotic pets has a major
   influence on exotic species demand. This study aimed to investigate
   exotic pet popularity, featured species on social media in the Middle
   East, and public perception of the animals spotlighted by public
   figures. We discuss the impact of such on the exotic pet trade and
   possible solutions to this issue. Male public figures from the United
   Arab Emirates predominated in the collected data, with most posts
   sourced from Instagram (R). Eighty-five percent of the species displayed
   on social media posts were Convention on International Trade in
   Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I- and
   II-listed, including big cats, birds of prey, and great apes. Through an
   investigation of social media posts of public figures in the Middle
   East, we found that there was an overall positive audience reception
   toward endangered exotic pets. Geographic region, social media platform,
   animal species, and animal age all influenced the results. We recommend
   improving public education and awareness of wildlife conservation and
   laws regarding exotic pet possession to combat the idolization of the
   exotic pet industry. The popularization of exotic pets on celebrity
   social media in the Middle East has led to questionable impacts on
   exotic pet demand and threats to species conservation. The objective of
   this study was to identify exotic animal species featured on Middle
   Eastern celebrity social media account posts, the public perception of
   those posts, and their potential impacts on exotic pet demand and
   conservation (for global-scale extrapolation). Public social media
   accounts of highly influential persons from oil-rich Middle Eastern
   regions were manually investigated to evaluate subject demographics,
   species features, and post information (likes, comments) between January
   2017 and August 2018. Twenty-five subjects possessed active social media
   accounts, from which 418 social media posts were extracted based on
   their inclusion of a privately owned exotic animal. SPSS Version 25 was
   used for frequency and descriptive analyses of these posts, in addition
   to comment analyses to evaluate quantitative (emojis) and qualitative
   (text) audience perceptions from a total of 10 social media posts of
   CITES Appendix I- or II-listed species. A greater frequency of positive
   than negative comments was observed (n = 8017), demonstrating the higher
   likelihood of social media promotion rather than negation of the exotic
   pet trade. Public education on wildlife conservation and exotic animal
   trade risks is imperative for successful conservation and welfare
   protection.},

Title = {Using Patient-Reported Health Data From Social Media to Identify Diverse
   Lupus Patients and Assess Their Symptom and Medication Expressions: A
   Feasibility Study},
Journal = {ARTHRITIS CARE \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-372},
Month = {2023 FEB},
Abstract = {Objective Patient communities use social media for peer support and
   information seeking. This study assessed the feasibility of using public
   patient-generated health data from the social network Twitter to
   identify diverse lupus patients and gather their perspectives about
   disease symptoms and medications. Methods We extracted public
   lupus-related Twitter messages (n = 47,715 tweets) in English posted by
   users (n = 8,446) in the US between September 1, 2017 and October 31,
   2018. We analyzed the data to describe lupus patients and the expressed
   themes (symptoms and medications). Two independent coders analyzed the
   data; Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to ensure interrater
   reliability. Differences in symptom and medication expressions were
   analyzed using 2-tailed Z tests and a combination of 1-way analysis of
   variance tests and unpaired t-tests. Results We found that lupus
   patients on Twitter are diverse in gender and race: approximately
   one-third (34.64\%, 62 of 179) were persons of color (POCs), and 85.47\%
   were female. The expressed disease symptoms and medications varied
   significantly by gender and race. Most of our findings correlated with
   documented clinical observations, e.g., expressions of general pain
   (8.39\%, 709 of 8,446), flares (6.05\%, 511 of 8,446), and fatigue
   (4.18\%, 353 of 8,446). However, our data also revealed less well-known
   patient observations, e.g., possible racial disparities within ocular
   manifestations of lupus. Conclusion Our results indicate that social
   media surveillance can provide valuable data of clinical relevance from
   the perspective of lupus patients. The medical community has the
   opportunity to harness this information to inform the patient-centered
   care within underrepresented patient groups, such as POCs.},

Title = {Social media mining for birth defects research: A rule-based,
   bootstrapping approach to collecting data for rare health-related events
   on Twitter},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {68-78},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Although birth defects are the leading cause of infant
   mortality in the United States, methods for observing human pregnancies
   with birth defect outcomes are limited.
   Objective: The primary objectives of this study were (i) to assess
   whether rare health-related events-in this case, birth defects-are
   reported on social media, (ii) to design and deploy a natural language
   processing (NLP) approach for collecting such sparse data from social
   media, and (iii) to utilize the collected data to discover a cohort of
   women whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed on
   social media for epidemiological analysis.
   Methods: To assess whether birth defects are mentioned on social media,
   we mined 432 million tweets posted by 112,647 users who were
   automatically identified via their public announcements of pregnancy on
   Twitter. To retrieve tweets that mention birth defects, we developed a
   rule-based, bootstrapping approach, which relies on a lexicon, lexical
   variants generated from the lexicon entries, regular expressions,
   post-processing, and manual analysis guided by distributional
   properties. To identify users whose pregnancies with birth defect
   outcomes could be observed for epidemiological analysis, inclusion
   criteria were (i) tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth
   defect, and (ii) accessibility to the user's tweets during pregnancy. We
   conducted a semi-automatic evaluation to estimate the recall of the
   tweet-collection approach, and performed a preliminary assessment of the
   prevalence of selected birth defects among the pregnancy cohort derived
   from Twitter.
   Results: We manually annotated 16,822 retrieved tweets, distinguishing
   tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect (true
   positives) from tweets that merely mention birth defects (false
   positives). Inter-annotator agreement was substantial: K = 0.79 (Cohen's
   kappa). Analyzing the timelines of the 646 users whose tweets were true
   positives resulted in the discovery of 195 users that met the inclusion
   criteria. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth
   defect reported on Twitter, consistent with findings in the general
   population. Based on an evaluation of 4169 tweets retrieved using
   alternative text mining methods, the recall of the tweet collection
   approach was 0.95.
   Conclusions: Our contributions include (i) evidence that rare
   health-related events are indeed reported on Twitter, (ii) a
   generalizable, systematic NLP approach for collecting sparse tweets,
   (iii) a semi-automatic method to identify undetected tweets (false
   negatives), and (iv) a collection of publicly available tweets by
   pregnant users with birth defect outcomes, which could be used for
   future epidemiological analysis. In future work, the annotated tweets
   could be used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically
   identify users reporting birth defect outcomes, enabling the large-scale
   use of social media mining as a complementary method for such
   epidemiological research.},

Title = {Risk of recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy: survey from a social
   media group},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS \& GYNECOLOGY MFM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare but serious
   complication in the last trimester of pregnancy or postpartum period.
   Data on the recurrence risk are largely unavailable, as only case
   reports or very small case series exist in which only 1 woman had
   recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the risk of acute fatty liver of
   pregnancy recurrence and to compare disease severity and gestational age
   between primary and recurrent disease using patient-provided data from
   an acute fatty liver of pregnancy social media patient group.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and distributed an electronic
   questionnaire through an international Facebook group called ``Acute
   Fatty Liver of Pregnancy.{''} The data collection took place from June
   11, 2018, to August 17, 2018, using REDCap. Our main outcome measures
   were recurrence of acute fatty liver of pregnancy, severity with
   recurrence, and gestational age at delivery.
   RESULTS: A total of 69 women with previous acute fatty liver of
   pregnancy completed the questionnaire; 24 women had a subsequent
   delivery, of whom 5 women were diagnosed with acute fatty liver of
   pregnancy again. In 4 of 5 of these women (80\%), acute fatty liver of
   pregnancy took a milder course, whereas in 1 woman it worsened in the
   next pregnancy. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy recurrence
   delivered at a median gestational age at 265 days (interquartile range,
   242-287 days) in their first pregnancy with acute fatty liver of
   pregnancy as compared to delivery by a prelabor cesarean delivery at 245
   days (interquartile range, 235-261 days) in their second pregnancy with
   acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Male fetal sex was not associated with
   an increased risk of recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
   CONCLUSION: One in 5 women reported having had recurrent acute fatty
   liver of pregnancy, with most cases being milder, possibly because of an
   earlier gestational age at delivery.},

Title = {Cross-Verification of COVID-19 Information Obtained From Unofficial
   Social Media Accounts and Associated Changes in Health Behaviors:
   Web-Based Questionnaire Study Among Chinese Netizens},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: As social media platforms have become significant sources of
   information during the pandemic, a significant volume of both factual
   and inaccurate information related to the prevention of COVID-19 has
   been disseminated through social media. Thus, disparities in COVID-19
   information verification across populations have the potential to
   promote the dissemination of misinformation among clustered groups of
   people with similar characteristics.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the characteristics of social
   media users who obtained COVID-19 information through unofficial social
   media accounts and were (1) most likely to change their health behaviors
   according to web-based information and (2) least likely to actively
   verify the accuracy of COVID-19 information, as these individuals may be
   susceptible to inaccurate prevention measures and may exacerbate
   transmission.
   Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was
   disseminated by West China Hospital via its official online platforms,
   between May 18, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The questionnaire collected the
   sociodemographic information of 14,509 adults, and included questions
   surveying Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19, personal social
   media use, health behavioral change tendencies, and cross-verification
   behaviors for web-based information during the pandemic. Multiple
   stepwise regression models were used to examine the relationships
   between social media use, behavior changes, and information
   cross-verification.
   Results: Respondents who were most likely to change their health
   behaviors after obtaining web-based COVID-19 information from celebrity
   sources had the following characteristics: female sex (P=.004), age >=
   50 years (P=.009), higher COVID-19 knowledge and health literacy (P=.045
   and P=.03, respectively), non-health care professional (P=.02), higher
   frequency of searching on social media (P<.001), better health
   conditions (P<.001), and a trust rating score of more than 3 for
   information released by celebrities on social media (P=.005).
   Furthermore, among participants who were most likely to change their
   health behaviors according to social media information released by
   celebrities, female sex (P<.001), living in a rural residence rather
   than first-tier city (P<.001), self-reported medium health status and
   lower health care literacy (P=.007 and P<.001, respectively), less
   frequent search for COVID-19 information on social media (P<.001), and
   greater level of trust toward celebrities' social media accounts with a
   trust rating score greater than 1 (P <=.04) were associated with a lack
   of cross-verification of information.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that governments, health care
   agencies, celebrities, and technicians should combine their efforts to
   decrease the risk in vulnerable groups that are inclined to change
   health behaviors according to web-based information but do not perform
   any fact-check verification of the accuracy of the unofficial
   information. Specifically, it is necessary to correct the false
   information related to COVID-19 on social media, appropriately apply
   celebrities' star power, and increase Chinese netizens' awareness of
   information cross-verification and eHealth literacy for evaluating the
   veracity of web-based information.},

Title = {Using Tweets to Understand How COVID-19-Related Health Beliefs Are
   Affected in the Age of Social Media: Twitter Data Analysis Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ie, COVID-19) has given rise to
   a global pandemic affecting 215 countries and over 40 million people as
   of October 2020. Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic
   induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some
   inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social
   media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination
   of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher
   interactivities.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health
   beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as
   well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in
   health beliefs on social media.
   Methods: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media
   platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets
   corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020,
   were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health
   belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility,
   perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We
   utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to
   automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each
   of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually
   annotated for training the machine learning architectures.
   Results: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the
   receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the
   classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic
   reproduction number R(0 )of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter
   users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The
   fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect
   dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and
   public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as
   scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians'
   speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief
   trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92
   for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively).
   Conclusions: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an
   infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R-0
   greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about
   COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could
   partially intensify the infodemic. It is ``unhealthy{''} that both
   scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting
   the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as
   politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and
   could sometimes be misleading.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the association between degree of real-life
   closeness of social media (SM) contacts and depressive symptoms.
   Participants: Students ages 18-30 (N = 1124) were recruited in August
   2016. Methods: Participants completed an online survey assessing SM use
   and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess
   associations between real-life closeness of SM contacts and depressive
   symptoms. Results: After controlling for covariates, each 10\% increase
   in the proportion of SM friends with whom participants had no
   face-to-face relationship was associated with a 9\% increase in odds of
   depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.09; 95\% CI = 1.05-1.13). However, each
   10\% increase in the proportion of SM friends with whom participants had
   a close face-to-face relationship was associated with a 7\% decrease in
   depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.93; 95\% CI = 0.89-0.97). Conclusions:
   Having no in-person relationship with SM contacts is associated with
   increased depressive symptoms; however, having close in-person
   relationships with SM contacts is associated with decreased depressive
   symptoms.},

Month = {2020 NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction and Aims Infoveillance approaches (i.e. surveillance
   methods using online content) that leverage big data can provide new
   insights about infectious disease outbreaks and substance use disorder
   topics. We assessed social media messages about HIV, opioid use and
   injection drug use in order to understand how unstructured data can
   prepare public health practitioners for response to future outbreaks.
   Design and Methods We conducted an retrospective analysis of Twitter
   messages during the 2015 HIV Indiana outbreak using machine learning,
   statistical and geospatial analysis to examine the transition between
   opioid prescription drug abuse to heroin injection use and finally HIV
   transmission risk, and to test possible associations with disease burden
   and demographic variables in Indiana and Marion County. Tweets from
   October 2014 to June 2015 were compared to disease burden at the county
   level for Indiana, and classification of census blocks by presence of
   relevant messages was done at the census block level for Marion County.
   Marion County was used as it exhibited the highest total count of
   Tweets.
   Results 257 messages about substance abuse and HIV were significantly
   related to HIV rates (P < 0.001) and opioid-related hospitalisations (P
   = 0.037). Using 157 characteristics from the American Community Survey,
   a linear classifier was computed with an appreciable correlation (r =
   0.49) to risk-related social media messages from Marion County.
   Discussion and Conclusions Communities appear to communicate online in
   response to disease burden. Classification produced an accurate equation
   to model census block risk based on census data, allowing for
   high-dimensional estimation of risk for blocks with sparse populations.},

Title = {Big Data and Infectious Disease Epidemiology: Bibliometric Analysis and
   Research Agenda},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Background: Infectious diseases represent a major challenge for health
   systems worldwide. With the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, the need
   to research strategies to treat these health problems has become even
   more pressing. Although the literature on big data and data science in
   health has grown rapidly, few studies have synthesized these individual
   studies, and none has identified the utility of big data in infectious
   disease surveillance and modeling.Objective: The aim of this study was
   to synthesize research and identify hotspots of big data in infectious
   disease epidemiology. Methods: Bibliometric data from 3054 documents
   that satisfied the inclusion criteria retrieved from the Web of Science
   database over 22 years (2000-2022) were analyzed and reviewed. The
   search retrieval occurred on October 17, 2022. Bibliometric analysis was
   performed to illustrate the relationships between research constituents,
   topics, and key terms in the retrieved documents.Results: The
   bibliometric analysis revealed internet searches and social media as the
   most utilized big data sources for infectious disease surveillance or
   modeling. The analysis also placed US and Chinese institutions as
   leaders in this research area. Disease monitoring and surveillance,
   utility of electronic health (or medical) records, methodology framework
   for infodemiology tools, and machine/deep learning were identified as
   the core research themes.Conclusions: Proposals for future studies are
   made based on these findings. This study will provide health care
   informatics scholars with a comprehensive understanding of big data
   research in infectious disease epidemiology.},

Title = {Perceived Unmet Needs in Patients Living With Advanced Bladder Cancer
   and Their Caregivers: Infodemiology Study Using Data From Social Media
   in the United States},
Journal = {JMIR CANCER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Background: Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer (BC), which is
   generally termed advanced BC (aBC), has a very poor prognosis, and in
   addition to its physical symptoms, it is associated with emotional and
   social challenges. However, few studies have assessed the unmet needs
   and burden of aBC from patient and caregiver perspectives.
   Infodemiology, that is, epidemiology based on internet health-related
   content, can help obtain more insights on patients' and caregivers'
   experiences with aBC.
   Objective: The study aimed to identify the main discussion themes and
   the unmet needs of patients with aBC and their caregivers through a
   mixed methods analysis of social media posts.
   Methods: Social media posts were collected between January 2015 and
   April 2021 from US geolocalized sites using specific keywords for aBC.
   Automatic natural language processing (regular expressions and machine
   learning) methods were used to filter out irrelevant content and
   identify verbatim posts from patients and caregivers. The verbatim posts
   were analyzed to identify main discussion themes using biterm topic
   modeling. Difficulties or unmet needs were further explored using
   qualitative research methods by 2 independent annotators until
   saturation of concepts.
   Results: A total of 688 posts from 262 patients and 1214 posts from 679
   caregivers discussing aBC were identified. Analysis of 340 randomly
   selected patient posts and 423 randomly selected caregiver posts
   uncovered 33 unique unmet need categories among patients and 36 among
   caregivers. The main unmet patient needs were related to challenges
   regarding adverse events (AEs; 28/95, 29\%) and the psychological impact
   of aBC (20/95, 21\%). Other patient unmet needs identified were
   prognosis or diagnosis errors (9/95, 9\%) and the need for better
   management of aBC symptoms (9/95, 9\%). The main unmet caregiver needs
   were related to the psychological impacts of aBC (46/177, 26.0\%), the
   need for support groups and to share experiences between peers (28/177,
   15.8\%), and the fear and management of patient AEs (22/177, 12.4\%).
   Conclusions: The combination of manual and automatic methods allowed the
   extraction and analysis of several hundreds of social media posts from
   patients with aBC and their caregivers. The results highlighted the
   emotional burden of cancer for both patients and caregivers. Additional
   studies on patients with aBC and their caregivers are required to
   quantitatively explore the impact of this disease on quality of life.},

Title = {Drug Abuse Ontology to Harness Web-Based Data for Substance Use
   Epidemiology Research: Ontology Development Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Web-based resources and social media platforms play an
   increasingly important role in health-related knowledge and experience
   sharing. There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data
   sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and
   trends.Objective: The key aims were to describe the development and
   application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for
   analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and
   substance use research in the following areas: determining user
   knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of
   buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of
   web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing
   patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving
   cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of
   Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the
   availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of
   cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends
   in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per
   Mental Health America reports.Methods: The domain and scope of the DAO
   were defined using competency questions from popular ontology
   methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes
   determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing
   knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the
   classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The
   quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best
   practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial
   intelligence community that engage in natural language
   processing.Results: The current version of the DAO comprises 315
   classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The
   ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The
   integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms
   dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge
   to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to
   capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze
   data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.Conclusions: The
   DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be
   expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health
   domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for
   substance use epidemiology research.},

Title = {Understanding Public Perceptions of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps:
   Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Social Media Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent
   spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many
   governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed
   on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
   Objective: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of
   artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using
   Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19
   contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom.
   Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media
   posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We
   used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were
   predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then
   applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and
   a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based
   ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep
   learning-based approaches.
   Results: Overall, we observed 76\% positive and 12\% negative
   sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the
   North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced
   by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing
   by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health
   service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.
   Conclusions: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates
   surrounding the information governance of health-related information.
   AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can
   help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies hold promise for supporting the detection and
   management of schizophrenia. This exploratory study aimed to generate an
   initial understanding of whether patterns of communication about
   depression and anxiety on popular social media among individuals with
   schizophrenia are consistent with offline representations of the
   illness. From January to July 2016, posts on Twitter were collected from
   a sample of Twitter users who self-identify as having a schizophrenia
   spectrum disorder (n = 203) and a randomly selected sample of control
   users (n = 173). Frequency and timing of communication about depression
   and anxiety were compared between groups. In total, the groups posted n
   = 1,544,122 tweets and users had similar characteristics. Twitter users
   with schizophrenia showed significantly greater odds of tweeting about
   depression compared with control users (OR = 2.69; 95\% CI 1.76-4.10),
   and significantly greater odds of tweeting about anxiety compared with
   control users (OR = 1.81; 95\% CI 1.20-2.73). This study offers
   preliminary insights that Twitter users with schizophrenia may express
   elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety in their online posts, which
   is consistent with clinical characteristics of schizophrenia observed in
   offline settings. Social media platforms could further our understanding
   of schizophrenia by informing a digital phenotype and may afford new
   opportunities to support early illness detection.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Social Media Analysis for
   Pharmacovigilance of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United Kingdom:
   Observational Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom
   started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a
   subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among
   vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in
   particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs).
   Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about
   AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward
   the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the
   frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the
   United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward
   COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406
   relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30,
   2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach,
   initially using COVID-19-related keywords and then using vaccine-and
   manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and
   modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week
   periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid
   ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and
   deep learning-based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to
   the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19
   AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346
   users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the
   4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of
   mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most
   frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite
   (n=79,132, 14\%), allergy (n=53,924, 9\%), injection site (n=56,152,
   10\%), and clots (n=43,907, 8\%). We also found some rarely reported
   AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2\%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome
   (n=9576, 2\%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side
   effects like headache (n=10,641, 2\%), fever (n=12,707, 2\%), and
   diarrhea (n=16,559, 3\%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward
   vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58\%), with a
   near equal split between negative (22\%) and neutral (19\%) sentiments.
   The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor
   variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and
   debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on
   social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in
   the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected
   potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected
   elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our
   findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a
   complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used
   for pharmacovigilance purposes.},

Title = {The role of social media in public health crises caused by infectious
   disease: a scoping review},
Journal = {BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {ImportanceThe onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic highlighted the
   increasing role played by social media in the generation, dissemination
   and consumption of outbreak-related information.ObjectiveThe objective
   of the current review is to identify and summarise the role of social
   media in public health crises caused by infectious disease, using a
   five-step scoping review protocol.Evidence reviewKeyword lists for two
   categories were generated: social media and public health crisis. By
   combining these keywords, an advanced search of various relevant
   databases was performed to identify all articles of interest from 2000
   to 2021, with an initial retrieval date of 13 December 2021. A total of
   six medical and health science, psychology, social science and
   communication databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus,
   Embase, PsycINFO and CNKI. A three-stage screening process against
   inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted.FindingsA total of 338
   studies were identified for data extraction, with the earliest study
   published in 2010. Thematic analysis of the role of social media
   revealed three broad themes: surveillance monitoring, risk communication
   and disease control. Within these themes, 12 subthemes were also
   identified. Within surveillance monitoring, the subthemes were disease
   detection and prediction, public attitude and attention, public
   sentiment and mental health. Within risk communication, the subthemes
   were health advice, information-seeking behaviour,
   infodemics/misinformation circulation, seeking help online, online
   distance education and telehealth. Finally, within disease control, the
   subthemes were government response, public behaviour change and health
   education information quality. It was clear that the pace of research in
   this area has gradually increased over time as social media has evolved,
   with an explosion in attention following the outbreak of
   COVID-19.Conclusions and relevanceSocial media has become a hugely
   powerful force in public health and cannot be ignored or viewed as a
   minor consideration when developing public health policy. Limitations of
   the study are discussed, along with implications for government, health
   authorities and individual users. The pressing need for government and
   health authorities to formalise evidence-based strategies for
   communicating via social media is highlighted, as well as issues for
   individual users in assessing the quality and reliability of information
   consumed on social media platforms.},

Title = {Patients' willingness to share digital health and non-health data for
   research: a cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background Patients generate large amounts of digital data through
   devices, social media applications, and other online activities. Little
   is known about patients' perception of the data they generate online and
   its relatedness to health, their willingness to share data for research,
   and their preferences regarding data use. Methods Patients at an
   academic urban emergency department were asked if they would donate any
   of 19 different types of data to health researchers and were asked about
   their views on data types' health relatedness. Factor analysis was used
   to identify the structure in patients' perceptions of willingness to
   share different digital data, and their health relatedness. Results Of
   595 patients approached 206 agreed to participate, of whom 104 agreed to
   share at least one types of digital data immediately, and 78\% agreed to
   donate at least one data type after death. EMR, wearable, and Google
   search histories (80\%) had the highest percentage of reported health
   relatedness. 72\% participants wanted to know the results of any
   analysis of their shared data, and half wanted their healthcare provider
   to know. Conclusion Patients in this study were willing to share a
   considerable amount of personal digital data with health researchers.
   They also recognize that digital data from many sources reveal
   information about their health. This study opens up a discussion around
   reconsidering US privacy protections for health information to reflect
   current opinions and to include their relatedness to health.},

Abstract = {At the heart of spatial epidemiology is the need to describe and
   understand variation in population health. In this review and
   introduction to the themed issue on ``Spatial Analysis and GIS in
   Epidemiology,{''} we present theoretical foundations and methodological
   developments in spatial epidemiology, discuss spatial analytical
   techniques and their public health applications, and identify novel data
   sources and applications with the potential to make epidemiology more
   consequential. Challenges with using georeferenced data are also
   explored, including dealing with small sample sizes, missingness,
   generalizability, and geographic scale. Given the increasing
   availability of spatial data and visualization tools, we have an
   opportunity to overcome traditionally siloed fields and practice
   settings to advance knowledge and more appropriately respond to emerging
   public health crises. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Social media as a recruitment platform for a nationwide online survey of
   COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices in the United States:
   methodology and feasibility analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into one of the most
   impactful health crises in modern history, compelling researchers to
   explore innovative ways to efficiently collect public health data in a
   timely manner. Social media platforms have been explored as a research
   recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for
   collecting representative survey data during infectious disease
   epidemics remain unexplored. Objectives This study has two aims 1)
   describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults
   residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on
   COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the
   preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social
   media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these
   challenges. Methods An original web-based survey informed by evidence
   from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook
   advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online
   Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only
   and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth
   and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of
   disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing
   observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. Results In
   total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from
   all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The
   advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in
   9609 clicks (4.07\% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was \$906,
   resulting in costs of \$0.09 per click and \$0.18 per full response
   (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement
   improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from
   approximately 20 to 40\%. Conclusions The social media advertisement
   campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale,
   nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the
   proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who
   didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance
   representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future
   research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection
   of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as
   COVID-19.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, social media has evolved as one of the leading
   platform to create, share, or exchange information; it is commonly used
   as a way for individuals to maintain social connections. In this online
   digital world, people use to post texts or pictures to express their
   views socially and create user-user engagement through discussions and
   conversations. Thus, social media has established itself to bear signals
   relating to human behavior. One can easily design user characteristic
   network by scraping through someone's social media profiles. In this
   paper, we investigate the potential of social media in characterizing
   and understanding predominant drunk texters from the perspective of
   their social, psychological and linguistic behavior as evident from the
   content generated by them. Our research aims to analyze the behavior of
   drunk texters on social media and to contrast this with non-drunk
   texters. We use Twitter social media to obtain the set of drunk texters
   and non-drunk texters and show that we can classify users into these two
   respective sets using various psycholinguistic features with an overall
   average accuracy of 96.78\% with very high precision and recall. Note
   that such an automatic classification can have far-reaching impact - (i)
   on health research related to addiction prevention and control, and (ii)
   in eliminating abusive and vulgar contents from Twitter, borne by the
   tweets of drunk texters.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Substance abuse and addiction is a significant contemporary
   health crisis. Modeling its epidemiology and designing effective
   interventions requires real-time data analysis along with the means to
   contextualize addiction patterns across the individual-to-community
   scale. In this context, social media platforms have begun to receive
   significant attention as a novel source of real-time user-reported
   information. However, the ability of epidemiologists to use such
   information is significantly stymied by the lack of publicly available
   algorithms and software for addiction information extraction, analysis
   and modeling.
   Results: SMARTS is a public, open source, web-based application that
   addresses the aforementioned deficiency. SMARTS is designed to analyze
   data from two popular social media forums, namely, Reddit and Twitter
   and can be used to study the effect of various intoxicants including,
   opioids, weed, kratom, alcohol and cigarettes. The SMARTS software
   analyzes social media posts using natural language processing, and
   machine learning to characterize drug use at both the individual- and
   population-levels. Included in SMARTS is a predictive modeling
   functionality that can, with high accuracy, identify individuals open to
   addiction recovery interventions. SMARTS also supports extraction,
   analysis and visualization of a number of key informational and
   demographic characteristics including post topics and sentiment, drug-
   and recovery-term usage, geolocation and age. Finally, the distributions
   of the aforementioned characteristics as derived from a set of 170 097
   drug users are provided as part of SMARTS and can be used by researchers
   as a reference.},

Title = {Longitudinal social network analysis of avian mycobacteriosis incidence
   in a large population of zoo birds},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {2021 AUG},
Abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted
   to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict
   future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between
   different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409
   individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely
   monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A
   retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were
   used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird,
   and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed
   from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure
   histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable
   longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether
   exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was
   associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step.
   Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing
   mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for
   birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to
   another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a
   positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was
   independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds
   ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in
   adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in
   distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of
   interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further
   characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian
   mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more
   likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries
   and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the
   contact (same species versus different species) were also significant
   predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model
   variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and
   discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious
   process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low
   transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time
   even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation
   efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at
   reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population
   sustainability.},

Title = {Implications of social media misinformation on COVID-19 vaccine
   confidence among pregnant women in Africa},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 MAR-APR},
Abstract = {It has been over a year since the World Health Organization (WHO)
   declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of
   International Concern and subsequently a global pandemic. The world has
   experienced a lot of uncertainty since then as we all get used to this
   new `normal' with social distancing measures, lockdowns, the emergence
   of new variants, and an array of hope with the development of vaccines.
   Having an abstract understanding of vaccine delivery, public perceptions
   of vaccines, and promoting acceptance of vaccines are critical to
   tackling the pandemic. The advent of the pandemic has led to the
   emergence of an `infodemic' or rampant misinformation surrounding the
   virus, treatment, and vaccines. This poses a critical threat to global
   health as it has the potential to lead to a public health crisis by
   exacerbating disease spread and overwhelming healthcare systems. This
   `infodemic' has led to rising vaccine hesitancy which is of paramount
   concern with the WHO even identifying it as one of the ten main threats
   to Global health almost 2 years before the approval of COVID-19
   vaccines. Pregnant African women are one of the most vulnerable
   population groups in a region with an already burdened healthcare
   system. Currently, there isn't ample research in the literature that
   explores vaccine hesitancy in this subpopulation and the impact of
   social media misinformation surrounding it. The aim of this paper is to
   highlight the implications of this `infodemic' on the pregnant African
   population and suggest key recommendations for improved healthcare
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The surveillance and preventions of infectious disease epidemics such as
   influenza and Ebola are important and challenging issues. It is
   therefore crucial to characterize the disease progress and epidemics
   process efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model
   the progression of the disease and its underlying contact network, but
   as yet lacks the ability to process of real-time and fine-grained
   surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and
   detailed disease surveillance but is insensible to the underlying
   contact network and disease model. To address these challenges
   simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised neural
   network framework that integrates the strengths of computational
   epidemiology and social media mining techniques for influenza
   epidemiological modeling. Specifically, this framework learns social
   media users' health states and intervention actions in real time,
   regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. The
   learned knowledge from social media can then be fed into the
   computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
   disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm
   that iteratively processes the above interactive learning process. The
   extensive experimental results provided demonstrated that our approach
   can not only outperform competing methods by a substantial margin in
   forecasting disease outbreaks, but also characterize the
   individual-level disease progress and diffusion effectively and
   efficiently.},

Abstract = {With the global pandemic driving the adoption of digital health,
   understanding the predictors or determinants of digital health usage and
   information sharing gives an opportunity to advocate for broader
   adoption. We examined the prevalence and predictors of digital health
   usage and information-sharing behaviors among American adults. Data were
   from the Health Information National Trends Survey 5 Cycle 4. More than
   two-thirds used a digital resource for health-related activities (eg, to
   check test results). About 81\% were willing to share their digital data
   with their provider, 75\% with family, and 58\% with friends. Only 14\%
   shared health information on social media. Gender, education, device
   types, and performance expectancy of digital health were common factors
   associated with both digital health usage and information-sharing
   behaviors. Other predictors included rurality, patient portal access,
   income, and having a chronic disease. Of note, we found that Asian
   American Pacific Islanders, compared with Whites, were less likely to
   share information with providers. Performance expectancy was a
   significant determinant of information sharing. Those diagnosed with
   diabetes were 4\% less likely to share information with their providers.
   With the growing digital divide, there is a need to advocate for more
   usable and accessible digital health to assist with person-centered
   care.},

Title = {Enabling realistic health data re-identification risk assessment through

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {744-752},
Month = {2021 APR},
Abstract = {Objective: Re-identification risk methods for biomedical data often
   assume a worst case, in which attackers know all identifiable features
   (eg, age and race) about a subject. Yet, worst-case adversarial modeling
   can overestimate risk and induce heavy editing of shared data. The
   objective of this study is to introduce a framework for assessing the
   risk considering the attacker's resources and capabilities.
   Materials and Methods: We integrate 3 established risk measures (ie,
   prosecutor, journalist, and marketer risks) and compute
   re-identification probabilities for data subjects. This probability is
   dependent on an attacker's capabilities (eg, ability to obtain external
   identified resources) and the subject's decision on whether to reveal
   their participation in a dataset. We illustrate the framework through
   case studies using data from over 1 000 000 patients from Vanderbilt
   University Medical Center and show how re-identification risk changes
   when attackers are pragmatic and use 2 known resources for attack: (1)
   voter registration lists and (2) social media posts.
   Results: Our framework illustrates that the risk is substantially
   smaller in the pragmatic scenarios than in the worst case. Our
   experiments yield a median worst-case risk of 0.987 (where 0 is least
   risky and 1 is most risky); however, the median reduction in risk was
   90.1\% in the voter registration scenario and 100\% in the social media
   posts scenario. Notably, these observations hold true for a wide range
   of adversarial capabilities.
   Conclusions: This research illustrates that re-identification risk is
   situationally dependent and that appropriate adversarial modeling may
   permit biomedical data sharing on a wider scale than is currently the
   case.},

Abstract = {Background Social media platforms are increasingly used by patients to
   research and discuss medical problems. Objective The aim of this study
   was to identify by whom, how frequently, and in what manner allergic
   contact dermatitis (ACD) is discussed on social media sites. Methods
   Search terms ``allergic contact dermatitis{''} and ``contact
   dermatitis{''} were queried across Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook,
   YouTube, and Google search metrics. The frequency, content, and creators
   of the content were assessed. Results ACD content was identified on all
   platforms, generated by by patients, physicians, professional
   organizations, and companies. When comparing the volume of posts, more
   content was on Instagram than Twitter, particularly among patients.
   Patient support groups were identified on Facebook but not on Reddit. A
   formal analysis of YouTube videos found that the medical information
   presented in these videos was often of poor quality. Conclusions Patch
   testing physicians should be aware that information on ACD exists across
   social media sites. While some content is generated by physicians,
   patients and industry groups also post and share material. Patch testing
   physicians should know that there is an opportunity to share ACD
   information, but they should also be aware that patients are posting and
   creating online support communities independent of physicians.
   Highlights Online support communities exist for patients with ACD on
   Facebook. Online information is of lower quality, with a mean QUEST
   quality score of 7.4/28 on reviewed YouTube videos. Of the five social
   media sites reviewed, patients are most active on Instagram, Reddit, and
   Facebook. Approximately 9000 Google searches per month are conducted
   using contact dermatitis-related search terms. Differences in
   terminology exist between physicians and non-physicians. While the most
   popular hashtag term was ``contact dermatitis{''}, physicians
   disproportionately authored posts tagged with ``allergic contact
   dermatitis.{''}},

   data},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Background Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus2(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate basic
   epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also be
   potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the
   individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on
   different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact
   tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network
   analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission
   dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed
   SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data
   set with diagnosed patients as ``nodes{''} and their epidemiological
   contact as ``edges{''} was created. Directed network perspective was
   utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a ``source
   patient{''} towards a ``target patient{''}. Network measures of ``degree
   centrality{''} and ``betweenness centrality{''} were calculated to
   identify influential patients in the transmission of infection.
   Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub-
   groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures
   and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results
   Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959
   patients, 11.27\% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to
   40.19\% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12)
   patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have
   collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients.
   Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93) patients
   had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the
   transmission between other patients. Network component analysis
   identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential
   patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95\% of total patients
   (1959) and 68.74\% of epidemiological contacts in the network.
   Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact
   tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level
   variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified
   individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately
   contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools
   could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help
   improve the contact tracing activities.},

Title = {Linking Individual-Level Facebook Posts With Psychological and Health
   Data in an Epidemiological Cohort: Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Psychological factors (eg, depression) and related
   biological and behavioral responses are associated with numerous
   physical health outcomes. Most research in this area relies on
   self-reported assessments of psychological factors, which are difficult
   to scale because they may be expensive and time-consuming. Investigators
   are increasingly interested in using social media as a novel and
   convenient platform for obtaining information rapidly in large
   populations.
   Objective: We evaluated the feasibility of obtaining Facebook data from
   a large ongoing cohort study of midlife and older women, which may be
   used to assess psychological functioning efficiently with low cost.
   Methods: This study was conducted with participants in the Nurses'
   Health Study II (NHSII), which was initiated in 1989 with biennial
   follow-ups. Facebook does not share data readily; therefore, we
   developed procedures to enable women to download and transfer their
   Facebook data to cohort servers (for linkage with other study data they
   have provided). Since privacy is a critical concern when collecting
   individual-level data, we partnered with a third-party software
   developer, Digi.me, to enable participants to obtain their own Facebook
   data and to send it securely to our research team. In 2020, we invited a
   subset of the 18,519 NHSII participants (aged 56-73 years) via email to
   participate. Women were selected if they reported on the 2017-2018
   questionnaire that they regularly posted on Facebook and were still
   active cohort participants. We included an exit survey for those who
   chose not to participate in order to gauge the reasons for
   nonparticipation.
   Results: We invited 309 women to participate. Few women signed the
   consent form (n=52), and only 3 used the Digi.me app to download and
   transfer their Facebook data. This low participation rate was observed
   despite modifying our protocol between waves of recruitment, including
   by (1) excluding active health care workers, who might be less available
   to participate due to the pandemic, (2) developing a Frequently Asked
   Questions factsheet to provide more information regarding the protocol,
   and (3) simplifying the instructions for using the Digi.me app. On our
   exit survey, the reasons most commonly reported for not participating
   were concerns regarding data privacy and hesitation sharing personal
   Facebook posts. The low participation rate suggests that obtaining
   individual-level Facebook data in a cohort of middle-aged and older
   women may be challenging.
   Conclusions: In this cohort of midlife and older women who were actively
   participating for over three decades, we were largely unable to obtain
   permission to access individual-level data from participants' Facebook
   accounts. Despite working with a third-party developer to customize an
   app to implement safeguards for privacy, data privacy remained a key
   concern in these women. Future studies aiming to leverage
   individual-level social media data should explore alternate populations
   or means of sharing social media data.},

Abstract = {Background Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the
   significant factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US.
   Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In
   particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and
   self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated
   with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not
   directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be
   difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use
   and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic
   tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of
   substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior
   underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a
   statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to
   assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse.
   Results We found that both emotional distress and physical pain
   significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development
   activities and social relationships of the substance users were also
   found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of
   self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the
   mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be
   positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that
   lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse.
   Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a
   greater correlation with addiction relapse.
   Conclusions The paper describes how observable variables can be
   extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent
   constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report
   factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the
   best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first use of structural
   equation modeling of social media data with the goal of analyzing
   factors influencing addiction recovery.},

Abstract = {Disasters have substantial consequences for population mental health. We
   used Twitter to (1) extract negative emotions indicating discomfort in
   New York City (NYC) before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
   We further aimed to (2) identify whether pre- or peri-disaster
   discomfort were associated with peri- or post-disaster discomfort,
   respectively, and to (3) assess geographic variation in discomfort
   across NYC census tracts over time. Our sample consisted of 1,018,140
   geo-located tweets that were analyzed with an advanced sentiment
   analysis called ``Extracting the Meaning Of Terse Information in a
   Visualization of Emotion{''} (EMOTIVE). We calculated discomfort rates
   for 2137 NYC census tracts, applied spatial regimes regression to find
   associations of discomfort, and used Moran's I for spatial cluster
   detection across NYC boroughs over time. We found increased discomfort,
   that is, bundled negative emotions after the storm as compared to during
   the storm. Furthermore, pre- and peri-disaster discomfort was positively
   associated with post-disaster discomfort; however, this association was
   different across boroughs, with significant associations only in
   Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. In addition, rates were most
   prominently spatially clustered in Staten Island lasting pre- to
   post-disaster. This is the first study that determined significant
   associations of negative emotional responses found in social media posts
   over space and time in the context of a natural disaster, which may
   guide us in identifying those areas and populations mostly in need for
   care.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the collection and analysis of relevant
   Twitter data on a state-by-state basis for (i) measuring public opinion
   on marijuana legalization by mining sentiment in Twitter data and (ii)
   determining the usage trends for six distinct types of marijuana. We
   overcome the challenges posed by the informal and ungrammatical nature
   of tweets to analyze a corpus of 306,835 relevant tweets collected over
   the four-month period, preceding the November 2015 Ohio Marijuana
   Legalization ballot and the four months after the election for all
   states in the US. Our analysis revealed two key insights: (i) the people
   in states that have legalized recreational marijuana express greater
   positive sentiments about marijuana than the people in states that have
   either legalized medicinal marijuana or have not legalized marijuana at
   all; (ii) the states that have a high percentage of positive sentiment
   about marijuana is more inclined to authorize (e.g., by allowing medical
   marijuana) or broaden its legal usage (e.g., by allowing recreational
   marijuana in addition to medical marijuana). Our analysis shows that
   social media can provide reliable information and can serve as an
   alternative to traditional polling of public opinion on drug use and
   epidemiology research.},

Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {The number of retracted articles has grown fast. However, the extent to
   which researchers and the public are made adequately aware of these
   retractions and how the media and social media respond to them remains
   unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the media and social media attention
   received by retracted articles and assess also the attention they
   receive post-retraction versus pre-retraction. We downloaded all records
   of retracted literature maintained by the Retraction Watch Database and
   originally published between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. For
   all 3,008 retracted articles with a separate DOI for the original and
   its retraction, we downloaded the respective Altmetric Attention Score
   (AAS) (from Altmetric) and citation count (from Crossref), for the
   original article and its retraction notice on June 6, 2018. We also
   compared the AAS of a random sample of 572 retracted full journal
   articles available on PubMed to that of unretracted full articles
   matched from the same issue and journal. 1,687 (56.1\%) of retracted
   research articles received some amount of Altmetric attention, and 165
   (5.5\%) were even considered popular (AAS>20). 31 (1.0\%) of 2,953 with
   a record on Crossref received >100 citations by June 6, 2018. Popular
   articles received substantially more attention than their retraction,
   even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction (Median
   difference, 29; 95\% CI, 17-61). Unreliable results were the most
   frequent reason for retraction of popular articles (32; 19\%), while
   fake peer review was the most common reason (421; 15\%) for the
   retraction of other articles. In comparison to matched articles,
   retracted articles tended to receive more Altmetric attention (23/31
   matched groups; P-value, 0.01), even after adjusting for attention
   received post-retraction. Our findings reveal that retracted articles
   may receive high attention from media and social media and that for
   popular articles, pre-retraction attention far outweighs post-retraction
   attention.},

Title = {Public Perspectives of Using Social Media Data to Improve Adverse Drug
   Reaction Reporting: A Mixed-Methods Study},
Journal = {DRUG SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {553-564},
Month = {2021 MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction Information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
   voluntarily submitted by patients can be a valuable source of
   information for improving drug safety; however, public awareness of
   reporting mechanisms remains low. Whilst methods to automatically detect
   ADR mentions from social media posts using text mining techniques have
   been proposed to improve reporting rates, it is unclear how acceptable
   these would be to social media users. Objective The objective of this
   study was to explore public opinion about using automated methods to
   detect and report mentions of ADRs on social media to enhance
   pharmacovigilance efforts. Methods Users of the online health discussion
   forum HealthUnlocked participated in an online survey (N = 1359) about
   experiences with ADRs, knowledge of pharmacovigilance methods, and
   opinions about using automated data mining methods to detect and report
   ADRs. To further explore responses, five qualitative focus groups were
   conducted with 20 social media users with long-term health conditions.
   Results Participant responses indicated a low awareness of
   pharmacovigilance methods and ADR reporting. They showed a strong
   willingness to share health-related social media data about ADRs with
   researchers and regulators, but were cautious about automated text
   mining methods of detecting and reporting ADRs. Conclusions Social media
   users value public-facing pharmacovigilance schemes, even if they do not
   understand the current framework of pharmacovigilance within the UK.
   Ongoing engagement with users is essential to understand views, share
   knowledge and respect users' privacy expectations to optimise future ADR
   reporting from online health communities.},

Abstract = {Adolescents with chronic pain (ACP) often experience impairments in
   their social functioning. Little is known about the consequences of
   these impairments on peer relationships of ACP. This study applied
   social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain
   problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems
   name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2),
   dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less
   positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship
   qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate
   the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study
   used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which
   followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3,
   Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4,
   standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested
   within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less
   popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated
   each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third,
   results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more
   pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less
   positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents
   with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship
   qualities moderated the relationship between pain and emotional
   distress. This study contributes to the literature on the importance of
   peer relationships of ACP. Clinical implications and directions for
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This dataset is composed by spatial (e.g. location) and thematic (e.g.
   diseases, symptoms, virus) entities concerning avian influenza in social
   media (textual) data in English. It was created from three corpora: the
   first one includes 10 transcriptions of YouTube videos and 70 tweets
   manually annotated. The second corpus is composed by the same textual
   data but automatically annotated with Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   tools. These two corpora have been built to evaluate NER tools and apply
   them to a bigger corpus. The third corpus is composed of 100 YouTube
   transcriptions automatically annotated with NER tools. The aim of the
   annotation task is to recognize spatial information such as the names of
   the cities and epidemiological information such as the names of the
   diseases. An annotation guideline is provided in order to ensure a
   unified annotation and to help the annotators. This dataset can be used
   to train or evaluate Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches such
   as specialized entity recognition. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Catastrophic and urgent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are known
   not only to polarize societies and induce selfish, individualistic
   behavior, but might also motivate altruistic behavior. We have analyzed
   COVID-19 perception using data collected from the Polish-language
   Internet from 15.01-30.06.2020, equaling 930,319 tweets. Deploying
   methods of computational social science and digital epidemiology, we aim
   to understand mechanisms of social consolidation and depolarization
   (measured by network modularity and sentiment) during the so-called
   ``stay-at-home phase{''} of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mauss' theory of
   interaction or exchange of gifts, the theory of social capital, as well
   as Kaniasty's theory of mobilization and deterioration serve as a
   background for reflection on the Polish example during the first
   epidemic wave. Our study highlights the potential of social support and
   caretaking to reduce affective and behavioral polarization in social
   media},

Abstract = {Objective To characterise MDR-TB outbreak and incorporate social network
   analysis with contact investigation to detect case-contact linkages and
   clusters. Methods MDR-TB cases registered in the district hospital
   between October 2012 and September 2015 were interviewed and their
   contacts were investigated. A relationship-based weighted network was
   constructed. Results Among 43 interviewed MDR-TB cases, 20 (47\%) were
   male, five (12\%) were asymptomatic (and discovered incidentally) and 22
   (51\%) had underlying diseases. From the documented 115 contacts, 61
   (53\%) were household contacts and 49 (43\%) were close (non-household)
   contacts; 70 (61\%) were screened for TB using various tests. In this
   network, we prioritised 37 contacts connected with more than one MDR-TB
   patient. The largest cluster was identified in the pharmacy unit of the
   hospital. Conclusion This investigation yielded a significant number of
   MDR-TB contacts, and social network analysis facilitated the
   prioritisation for screening. Social network analysis is useful and
   feasible in this program setting and complements MDR-TB contact
   investigation.},

Abstract = {During public health crises, public organizations face a variety of
   strategic communication challenges, and the outbreak of the COVID-19
   pandemic in 2020 is an extreme example. In Finland, the Prime Minister's
   Office initiated a communication campaign that utilized social media
   influencers to communicate timely instructions regarding the pandemic.
   However, it is uncertain how social media influencers adapt to briefings
   of public organizations given that they typically work with brands that
   align with their own interests and expertise, which rarely is
   epidemiology. We use the two-step flow of communication model and social
   influence theory to analyze research data that consisted of 96 Instagram
   posts, 108 Instagram Stories and 1097 comments. Qualitative content
   analysis was used to see how the influencers communicated about the
   pandemic and how their followers reacted. The results suggest that the
   influencers tried to adapt the messages to their own style, and, instead
   of committing to the wordings of the campaign, they shared general
   guidelines and, with their own example, showed how to behave during the
   pandemic. Their participation in the campaign helped affect social norms
   during the time of the crisis, which in the case of public health
   communication is a substantial, strategic goal.},

Title = {Puff or pass: do social media and social interactions influence smoking

Abstract = {Objective To determine whether the odds of being a smoker differ based
   on social media use and social interactions among urban university
   students in Bangladesh. Hypothesis Social media use and social
   interactions influence the smoking behaviour of Bangladeshi university
   students, particularly in starting and maintaining cigarette smoking.
   Design and setting A cross-sectional study using mixed methods on 600
   student smokers and non-smokers recruited from two public and two
   private universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country
   with limited resources. Exclusion criteria were those who did not use
   any form of social media and PhD students. Results Odds of smoking were
   significantly higher for those who socialised more than 4 hours/day
   (p<0.05; OR 1.75; 95\% CI 1.12 to 2.75) and typically at night (p<0.05;
   OR 2.80; 95\% CI 1.95 to 4.00). Odds of smoking were also higher for
   those who liked (p<0.05; OR 4.85; 95\% CI 3.32 to 7.11), shared (p<0.05;
   OR 20.50; 95\% CI 13.02 to 32.26) and followed (p<0.05; OR 2.88; 95\% CI
   1.36 to 6.11) tobacco-related content on social media. Qualitative
   analysis resulted in emergent themes of smokers imitating
   tobacco-related photos or videos seen on social media and peers as an
   influence for smoking initiation. Conclusion This study suggests social
   media and social interactions may influence smoking behaviour in
   university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Future research should
   continue to investigate the roles social media and social interaction
   have on smoking in order to explore social media-based smoking cessation
   interventions or dissemination of smoking health hazards through social
   media.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Social media use may be a risk factor for mental health
   problems in adolescents. However, few longitudinal studies have
   investigated this association, and none have quantified the proportion
   of mental health problems among adolescents attributable to social media
   use.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether time spent using social media per day is
   prospectively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems
   among adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of 6595
   participants from waves 1 (September 12, 2013, to December 14, 2014), 2
   (October 23, 2014, to October 30, 2015), and 3 (October 18, 2015, to
   October 23, 2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health
   study, a nationally representative cohort study of US adolescents,
   assessed US adolescents via household interviews using audio
   computer-assisted self-interviewing. Data analysis was performed from
   January 14, 2019, to May 22, 2019.
   EXPOSURES Self-reported time spent on social media during a typical day
   (none, <= 30 minutes, >30 minutes to <= 3 hours, >3 hours to <= 6 hours,
   and >6 hours) during wave 2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE Self-reported past-year internalizing problems
   alone, externalizing problems alone, and comorbid internalizing and
   externalizing problems during wave 3 using the Global Appraisal of
   Individual Needs-Short Screener.
   RESULTS A total of 6595 adolescents (aged 12-15 years during wave 1;
   3400 {[}51.3\%] male) were studied. In unadjusted analyses, spending
   more than 30 minutes of time on social media, compared with no use, was
   associated with increased risk of internalizing problems alone (<= 30
   minutes: relative risk ratio {[}RRR], 1.30; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.78; >30
   minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.36-2.64; >3 to <= 6 hours:
   RRR, 2.47; 95\% CI, 1.74-3.49; >6 hours: RRR, 2.83; 95\% CI, 1.88-4.26)
   and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (<= 30 minutes:
   RRR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.82; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 2.34;
   95\% CI, 1.83-3.00; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 3.15; 95\% CI, 2.43-4.09; >6
   hours: RRR, 4.29; 95\% CI, 3.22-5.73); associations with externalizing
   problems were inconsistent. In adjusted analyses, use of social media
   for more than 3 hours per day compared with no use remained
   significantly associated with internalizing problems alone (>3 to <= 6
   hours: RRR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.11-2.31; >6 hours: RRR, 1.78; 95\% CI,
   1.15-2.77) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (>3 to
   <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.01; 95\% CI, 1.51-2.66; >6 hours: RRR, 2.44; 95\% CI,
   1.73-3.43) but not externalizing problems alone.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per
   day using social media may be at heightened risk for mental health
   problems, particularly internalizing problems. Future research should
   determine whether setting limits on daily social media use, increasing
   media literacy, and redesigning social media platforms are effective
   means of reducing the burden of mental health problems in this
   population.},

Abstract = {Objective:To use a peer-to-peer and social media approach to reach out
   to men who have sex with men (MSM) and to distribute human
   immunodeficiency virus self-testing kits among them in an urban
   setting.Method: The cross-sectional, pilot study was conducted by a
   community-based organisation in Karachi from November 2020 to February
   2021, and comprised men aged 18 years or above who have sex with men.
   The subjects were provided one human immunodeficiency virus self-testing
   kit (HIVST) per person by trained outreach workers. It was an oral
   fluid-based kit. Data related to demographics, behavioural patterns and
   human immunodeficiency virus testing detail was collected on a
   structured questionnaire with some open-ended questions. The analysis of
   qualitative data was done manually, using content analysis technique in
   which all common responses were grouped that led to the generation of
   themes.Results: There were 150 male subjects with mean age 31.5+/-8.7
   years. Overall, 62(41.3\%) subjects had received up to 15 years of
   formal education, 94(62.6\%) were first-time testers; 139(92.7\%)
   performed the test at home; 11(7.3\%) used the kit at the
   community-based organisation's office. In terms of results, 1(0.7\%)
   participant had a reactive result which was later confirmed as positive
   for human immunodeficiency virus. Of the total, 145(96.6\%) participants
   found the instructions and the kit easy to use on their own, 83(55.3\%)
   preferred a social media-based approach, and 68(45.3\%) preferred the
   peer-to-peer approach. Conclusion: The HIVST was found to be acceptable
   among men who have sex with men, while peer-led and social media
   approaches seemed to be an effective method of information
   dissemination.},

Title = {Shaping applied epidemiology workforce training to strengthen emergency
   response: a global survey of applied epidemiologists, 2019-2020},
Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background Rapid and effective emergency response to address health
   security relies on a competent and suitably trained local and
   international workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the
   health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current
   and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in
   applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied
   epidemiology workforce. Method We conducted a cross-sectional online
   survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and
   snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey
   respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to
   disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020
   through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included
   demographic details of participants, along with their technical
   background, level of formal education, topics studied during
   epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We
   used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi(2)) to test the difference between
   categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to
   open-ended questions. Results In total, 282 people responded to the
   survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and
   epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology
   experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74\%
   (n = 210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP).
   Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by
   respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to
   emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common. FETP
   graduates reported higher levels of formal training in all survey
   topics. Conclusion It is critical for the health security workforce to
   be well-trained and equipped with skills needed to ensure a rapid and
   effective response to acute public health events. Leadership,
   communication, interpersonal skills, and specialist training in
   emergency response are lacking in current training models. Our study has
   demonstrated that applied epidemiology workforce training must evolve to
   remain relevant to current and future public health challenges.},

Abstract = {Background: SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was identified
   and quickly developed into a pandemic in spring, 2020. This event posed
   immense difficulties for healthcare nationally, with rural areas
   experiencing different challenges than other regions. Methods: The
   Association of Professionals in Infection Control \& Epidemiology
   conducted focus groups with infection preventionist (IP) members in
   September and October, 2020. Zoom sessions were recorded and
   transcribed. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results: In
   all, 38 IPs who work at a critical access hospital or a healthcare
   facility in a rural location participated. Major challenges identified
   by IPs in this study included addressing the lack of access to personal
   protective equipment (PPE), overwhelming workloads caused by the
   pandemic and multiple roles/ responsibilities, inaccurate social media
   messages, and generalized disbelief and disregard about the pandemic
   among rural community members. Conclusions: Gaps in preparedness
   identified in this study, such as the lack of PPE, need to be addressed
   to prevent occupational illness. In addition, health disparities and
   inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 heard by IPs in this study need to be
   addressed in order to increase compliance with public health safeguards
   among rural community members and minimize morbidity and mortality in
   these regions. (c) 2021 Association for Professionals in Infection

Abstract = {Objective:The rapid onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) created
   a complex virtual collective consciousness. Misinformation and
   polarization were hallmarks of the pandemic in the United States,
   highlighting the importance of studying public opinion online. Humans
   express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before on
   social media; co-occurrence of multiple data sources have become
   valuable for monitoring and understanding public sentimental
   preparedness and response to an event within our society.Methods:In this
   study, Twitter and Google Trends data were used as the co-occurrence
   data for the understanding of the dynamics of sentiment and interest
   during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States from January 2020 to
   September 2021. Developmental trajectory analysis of Twitter sentiment
   was conducted using corpus linguistic techniques and word cloud mapping
   to reveal 8 positive and negative sentiments and emotions. Machine
   learning algorithms were used to implement the opinion mining how
   Twitter sentiment was related to Google Trends interest with historical
   COVID-19 public health data.Results:The sentiment analysis went beyond
   polarity to detect specific feelings and emotions during the

Title = {Using Large-scale Social Media Analytics to Understand Patient
   Perspectives About Urinary Tract Infections: Thematic Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Background: Current qualitative literature about the experiences of
   women dealing with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is limited to
   patients recruited from tertiary centers and medical clinics. However,
   traditional focus groups and interviews may limit what patients share.
   Using digital ethnography, we analyzed free-range conversations of an
   online community.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate and characterize the patient
   perspectives of women dealing with UTIs using digital ethnography.
   Methods: A data-mining service was used to identify online posts. A
   thematic analysis was conducted on a subset of the identified posts.
   Additionally, a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) probabilistic topic
   modeling method was applied to review the entire data set using a
   semiautomatic approach. Each identified topic was generated as a
   discrete distribution over the words in the collection, which can be
   thought of as a word cloud. We also performed a thematic analysis of the
   word cloud topic model results.
   Results: A total of 83,589 posts by 53,460 users from 859 websites were
   identified. Our hand-coding inductive analysis yielded the following 7
   themes: quality-of-life impact, knowledge acquisition, support of the
   online community, health care utilization, risk factors and prevention,
   antibiotic treatment, and alternative therapies. Using the LDA topic
   model method, 105 themes were identified and consolidated into 9
   categories. Of the LDA-derived themes, 25.7\% (27/105) were related to
   online community support, and 22\% (23/105) focused on UTI risk factors
   and prevention strategies.
   Conclusions: Our large-scale social media analysis supports the
   importance and reproducibility of using online data to comprehend
   women's UTI experience. This inductive thematic analysis highlights
   patient behavior, self-empowerment, and online media utilization by
   women to address their health concerns in a safe, anonymous way.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with hydrocephalus experience symptoms related to
   hydrocephalus in an age-dependent manner. However, prevalence estimates
   of hydrocephalus symptoms in young and middle-aged (YMA) adult patients
   are rare and variable. Highlighting the importance of hydrocephalus
   symptom management, the persistence and intensity of headache or gait
   disturbance have been associated with signs of brain white matter
   integrity loss, including in treated YMA adult patients. Thus, it is
   important to ascertain which symptoms adult patients with hydrocephalus
   report most to confirm their relative importance.
   METHODS: Observations of symptom complaints were made from publicly
   viewable online responses to an inquiry posted by the Hydrocephalus
   Association to 2 Facebook webpages.
   RESULTS: Within 7 days of inquiry posting, 381 complaints of signs and
   symptoms were identified in 82 online responses. Headache, cognitive
   deficits (cognition and memory), and mobility issues (dizziness,
   balance, or gait problems) were most commonly reported by 63\%, 45\%,
   and 40\% of respondents, respectively. Results were highly similar for
   the subgroup of 53 patients reported as treated. For self-identified YMA
   patients (<60 years old), results were similar, but with fewer mobility
   complaints. Not previously reported, hypersensitivity to external
   stimuli was reported by one-half of the patients that reported headache.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide further quantitative support
   for the prioritization of study of headache, cognitive deficits, and
   mobility issues in YMA adult patients with hydrocephalus. Warranting
   further study, cranial hypersensitivity to external stimuli may
   represent a novel outcome measure, and treated YMA adult hydrocephalus
   patients continue to report symptoms associated with signs of brain
   damage.},

   for research, providing a pragmatic way of generating empirical evidence
   on psychological well-being based on the textual indicators across
   different populations. This study analyzed the information on various
   Reddit social media groups dedicated to mental health. The classes,
   namely depression, anxiety, bipolar, and SuicideWatch, using the SWMH
   dataset have been analyzed. The text-based interactions of persons with
   mental illness have common motifs like negative language and expressions
   like `hopelessness,' `emptiness,' or `helplessness.' Topic modeling
   identified recurring themes and subjects that helped classify
   discernible factors influencing mental health. Classifiers for
   multiclass classification to classify targeted mental health issues
   based on users' network behavior and posts were trained and tested to
   get predictions on context (e.g., MentalBERT) and non-context-based
   (e.g., LR and NB) models. The MentalBERT model outperformed the other
   eight baseline models with an average accuracy of 76.70\%, which is 4\%
   more than reported in previous studies. Explainable AI was used to
   examine the trustworthiness of each model, and the explanations were
   evaluated using the LIME model. Explainability is crucial as mental
   health data characterizes syndromes, outcomes, disorders, and
   signs/symptoms exhibiting probabilistic interrelationships with each
   other. Explanations of these intricate interconnections can assist the
   extensive research around the model of well-being and interventions
   intended to improve the human condition and distill positive human
   functioning.},

Title = {Active cannabis marketing and adolescent past-year cannabis use},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {204},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Methods: Data are from an online survey of 482 adolescents (aged 15-19
   years) living in states with legalized retail cannabis. Youth were asked
   about their engagement with cannabis promotions, including whether they
   liked/followed cannabis businesses on social media (Facebook, Twitter,
   and Instagram), had a favorite cannabis brand, or could see themselves
   owning/wearing a cannabis-branded product. Youth also self-reported
   cannabis use in the past year. We used logistic regression with a
   Bonferroni correction to compare the odds of cannabis use among youth
   with different levels of engagement with cannabis promotions and brands
   after controlling for demographics.
   Results: After adjusting for several possible confounders, youth who
   liked or followed a cannabis business on at least one social media
   platform had 5 times higher odds of past-year cannabis use (aOR = 5.00,
   95\% CI: 2.47, 10.09, p < 0.001). Youth who thought it was likely that
   they would own or wear cannabis-branded merchandise (aOR = 6.93, 95\%
   CI: 4.45, 10.78, p < 0.001) or who had a favorite cannabis brand (aOR =
   7.98, 95\% CI: 4.90, 13.00, p < 0.001) had nearly 8 times greater odds
   of past-year cannabis use.
   Conclusion: Youth who engage with cannabis promotions and brands had
   higher odds of past-year cannabis use. Jurisdictions with retail
   cannabis may want to consider restrictions to limit youth engagement
   with cannabis promotions.},

Title = {Social network analysis for better understanding of influenza},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction: The objective of this study is to improve the
   understanding of spatial spreading of complicated cases of influenza
   that required hospitalizations, by creating heatmaps and social
   networks. They will allow to identify critical hubs and routes of
   spreading of Influenza, in specific geographic locations, in order to
   contain infections and prevent complications, that require
   hospitalizations.
   Material and methods: Data were downloaded from the Healthcare Cost and
   Utilization Project (HCUP) - SID, New York State database. Patients
   hospitalized with flu complications, between 2003 and 2012 were included
   in the research (30,380 cases). A novel approach was designed, by
   constructing heatmaps for specific geographic regions in New York state
   and power law networks, in order to analyze distribution of hospitalized
   flu cases.
   Results: Heatmaps revealed that distributions of patients follow urban
   areas and big roads, indicating that flu spreads along routes, that
   people use to travel. A scale-free network, created from correlations
   among zip codes, discovered that, the highest populated zip codes didn't
   have the largest number of patients with flu complications. Among the
   top five most affected zip codes, four were in Bronx. Demographics of
   top affected zip codes were presented in results. Normalized numbers of
   cases per population revealed that, none of zip codes from Bronx were in
   the top 20. All zip codes with the highest node degrees were in New York
   City area.
   Discussion: Heatmaps identified geographic distribution of hospitalized
   flu patients and network analysis identified hubs of the infection. Our
   results will enable better estimation of resources for prevention and
   treatment of hospitalized patients with complications of Influenza.
   Conclusion: Analyses of geographic distribution of hospitalized patients
   with Influenza and demographic characteristics of populations, help us
   to make better planning and management of resources for Influenza
   patients, that require hospitalization. Obtained results could
   potentially help to save many lives and improve the health of the
   population.},

Abstract = {In the last decade drug overdose deaths reached staggering proportions
   in the US. Besides the raw yearly deaths count that is worrisome per se,
   an alarming picture comes from the steep acceleration of such rate that
   increased by 21\% from 2015 to 2016. While traditional public health
   surveillance suffers from its own biases and limitations, digital
   epidemiology offers a new lens to extract signals from Web and Social
   Media that might be complementary to official statistics. In this paper
   we present a computational approach to identify a digital cohort that
   might provide an updated and complementary view on the opioid crisis. We
   introduce an information retrieval algorithm suitable to identify
   relevant subspaces of discussion on social media, for mining data from
   users showing explicit interest in discussions about opioid consumption
   in Reddit. Moreover, despite the pseudonymous nature of the user base,
   almost 1.5 million users were geolocated at the US state level,
   resembling the census population distribution with a good agreement. A
   measure of prevalence of interest in opiate consumption has been
   estimated at the state level, producing a novel indicator with
   information that is not entirely encoded in the standard surveillance.
   Finally, we further provide a domain specific vocabulary containing
   informal lexicon and street nomenclature extracted by user-generated
   content that can be used by researchers and practitioners to implement
   novel digital public health surveillance methodologies for supporting
   policy makers in fighting the opioid epidemic.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The trend towards the use of the Internet for health information
   purposes is rising. Utilization of various forms of social media has
   been a key interest in consumer health informatics (CHI). To reveal the
   information needs of autism-affected users, this study centers on the
   research of users' interactions and information sharing within autism
   communities on social media. It aims to understand how autism-affected
   users utilize support groups on Facebook by applying natural language
   process (NLP) techniques to unstructured health data in social media. An
   interactive visualization method (pyLDAvis) was employed to evaluate
   produced models and visualize the inter-topic distance maps. The
   revealed topics (e.g., parenting, education, behavior traits) identify
   issues that individuals with autism were concerned about on a daily
   basis and how they addressed such concerns in the form of group
   communication. In addition to general social support, disease-specific
   information, collective coping strategies, and emotional support were
   provided as well by group members based on similar personal experiences.
   This study concluded that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is feasible
   and appropriated to derive topics (focus) from messages posted to the
   autism support groups on Facebook. The revealed topics help healthcare
   professionals (content providers) understand autism from users'
   perspectives and provide better patient communications.},

Abstract = {Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
   United States initially alerted the public to three COVID-19 signs and
   symptoms-fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Concurrent social
   media posts reflected a wider range of symptoms of COVID-19 besides
   these three symptoms. Because social media data have a potential
   application in the early identification novel virus symptoms, this study
   aimed to explore what symptoms mentioned in COVID-19-related social
   media posts during the early stages of the pandemic. Methods We
   collected COVID-19-related Twitter tweets posted in English language
   between March 30, 2020 and April 19, 2020 using search terms of COVID-19
   synonyms and three common COVID-19 symptoms suggested by the CDC in
   March. Only unique tweets were extracted for analysis of symptom terms.
   Results A total of 36 symptoms were extracted from 30,732 unique tweets.
   All the symptoms suggested by the CDC for COVID-19 screening in March,
   April, and May were mentioned in tweets posted during the early stages
   of the pandemic. Discussion The findings of this study revealed that
   many COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned in Twitter tweets earlier than
   the announcement by the CDC. Monitoring social media data is a promising
   approach to public health surveillance.},

Title = {Fixed orthodontic appliances and adolescents' peer relations in school A
   social network analysis using cross-sectional survey data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OROFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS-FORTSCHRITTE DER KIEFERORTHOPADIE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Studies from the 1970s and 1980s, but also recent investigations
   on social media suggest that wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance can
   be a cause of bullying and social exclusion. With the greater uptake of
   orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed
   braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable.
   This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects
   adolescents' social position in their peer networks using
   cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the
   seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about
   their social relationships in school. These directed network data were
   used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and
   victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical
   analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression
   models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19\% of the
   surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls
   with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for
   friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for
   victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These
   associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic
   differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically
   insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces
   in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students
   with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position
   in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses
   exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in
   interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology,
   epidemiology and medicine.},

Abstract = {Despite our understanding that social media and online healthcare
   communities can help to eliminate health information asymmetry and
   improve patients' self-care engagement, we have yet to understand what
   happens when patients have access to others' health data and how
   patients' access to these shared experiences and opinions influence
   their health knowledge and perceived treatment outcome. In this study,
   we apply social information processing theory and incorporate (1)
   uncertainty of a treatment, (2) information exposure, and (3)
   credibility of the information source into patients' information
   evaluation function to assess how patients utilize shared health
   information and experiences. An empirical model, which combines various
   aspects of patients' firsthand experiences about treatments into a
   single construct, yields empirical evidence that patients' perceived
   treatment outcome is prone to social influence from other patients'
   shared experiences. By disaggregating the sources of social influence,
   we find that social influence created by generalized others in the
   community outweighs that by familiar others of one's intimate social
   group. In addition, we find that other factors, such as positive
   sentiment in comments and patients' prior experiences, also affect
   patients' perceived treatment outcome. Based on our findings,
   implications for health promotion and health behaviors are presented.},

Title = {Combining Social Media and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to Detect
   Adverse Drug Reactions},
Journal = {DRUG SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {9},
Pages = {893-903},
Month = {2020 SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unintended reactions
   caused by a drug or combination of drugs taken by a patient. The current
   safety surveillance system relies on spontaneous reporting systems
   (SRSs) and more recently on observational health data; however, ADR
   detection may be delayed and lack geographic diversity. The broad scope
   of social media conversations, such as those on Twitter, can include
   health-related topics. Consequently, these data could be used to detect
   potentially novel ADRs with less latency. Although research regarding
   ADR detection using social media has made progress, findings are based
   on single information sources, and no study has yet integrated drug
   safety evidence from both an SRS and Twitter. Objective The aim of this
   study was to combine signals from an SRS and Twitter to facilitate the
   detection of safety signals and compare the performance of the combined
   system with signals generated by individual data sources. Methods We
   extracted potential drug-ADR posts from Twitter, used Monte Carlo
   expectation maximization to generate drug safety signals from both the
   US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and posts from Twitter, and then
   integrated these signals using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The
   results from the integrated system and two individual sources were
   evaluated using a reference standard derived from drug labels. Area
   under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was computed to
   measure performance. Results We observed a significant improvement in
   the AUC of the combined system when comparing it with Twitter alone, and
   no improvement when comparing with the SRS alone. The AUCs ranged from
   0.587 to 0.637 for the combined SRS and Twitter, from 0.525 to 0.534 for
   Twitter alone, and from 0.612 to 0.642 for the SRS alone. The results
   varied because different preprocessing procedures were applied to
   Twitter. Conclusion The accuracy of signal detection using social media
   can be improved by combining signals with those from SRSs. However, the
   combined system cannot achieve better AUC performance than data from
   FAERS alone, which may indicate that Twitter data are not ready to be
   integrated into a purely data-driven combination system.},

Title = {Role of Incentives in the Use of Blockchain-Based Platforms for Sharing
   Sensitive Health Data: Experimental Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Background: Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables secure and
   decentralized approaches to reduce technical risks and governance
   challenges associated with sharing data. Although blockchain-based
   solutions have been suggested for sharing health information, it is
   still unclear whether a suitable incentive mechanism (intrinsic or
   extrinsic) can be identified to encourage individuals to share their
   sensitive data for research purposes.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate how important extrinsic
   incentives are and what type of incentive is the best option in
   blockchain-based platforms designed for sharing sensitive health
   information.
   Methods: In this study, we conducted 3 experiments with 493 individuals
   to investigate the role of extrinsic incentives (ie, cryptocurrency,
   money, and recognition) in data sharing with research organizations.
   Results: The findings highlight that offering different incentives is
   insufficient to encourage individuals to use blockchain technology or to
   change their perceptions about the technology's premise for sharing
   sensitive health data. The results demonstrate that individuals still
   attribute serious risks to blockchain-based platforms. Privacy and
   security concerns, trust issues, lack of knowledge about the technology,
   lack of public acceptance, and lack of regulations are reported as top
   risks. In terms of attracting people to use blockchain-based platforms
   for data sharing in health care, we show that the effects of extrinsic
   motivations (cryptoincentives, money, and status) are significantly
   overshadowed by inhibitors to technology use.
   Conclusions: We suggest that before emphasizing the use of various types
   of extrinsic incentives, the users must be educated about the
   capabilities and benefits offered by this technology. Thus, an essential
   first step for shifting from an institution-based data exchange to a
   patient-centric data exchange (using blockchain) is addressing
   technology inhibitors to promote patient-driven data access control.
   This study shows that extrinsic incentives alone are inadequate to
   change users' perceptions, increase their trust, or encourage them to
   use technology for sharing health data.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze drug mentions in web forums to
   evaluate the utility of this data source for drug post-marketing
   studies. We automatically annotated over 60 million posts extracted from
   21 French web forums. Drug mentions detected in this corpus were matched
   to drug names in a French drug database (Theriaque (R)). Our analysis
   showed that a high proportion of the most frequent drug mentions in the
   selected web forums correspond to drugs that are usually prescribed to
   young women, such as combined oral contraceptives. The most mentioned
   drugs in our corpus correlated weakly to the most prescribed drugs in
   France but seemed to be influenced by events widely reported in
   traditional media. In this article, we conclude that web forums have
   high potential for post-marketing drug-related studies, such as
   pharmacovigilance, and observation of drug utilization. However, the
   bias related to forum selection and the corresponding population
   representativeness should always be taken into account.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and sociodemo-graphic correlates
   of cyberbullying victimization and perpetra-tion among a racially,
   ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population-based sample of
   11-12-year-old early adolescents.METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional
   data from the Adoles-cent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (Year
   2; N = 9429). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to
   estimate associations between sociodemographic factors (sex,
   race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, country of birth, household income,
   parental education) and adolescent-reported cyberbul-lying victimization
   and perpetration.RESULTS: In the overall sample, lifetime prevalence of
   cyber-bullying victimization was 9.6\%, with 65.8\% occurring in the
   past 12 months, while lifetime prevalence of cyberbullying per-petration
   was 1.1\%, with 59.8\% occurring in the past 12 months. Boys reported
   higher odds of cyberbullying perpetration (AOR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.01-2.92)
   but lower odds of cyberbullying victimization (AOR 0.80, 95\% CI
   0.68-0.94) than girls. Sexual minorities reported 2.83 higher odds of
   cyberbullying victimiza-tion (95\% CI 1.69-4.75) than nonsexual
   minorities. Lower household income was associated with 1.64 (95\% CI
   1.34 -2.00) higher odds of cyberbullying victimization than higher
   household income, however household income was not associ-ated with
   cyberbullying perpetration. Total screen time, particu-larly on the
   internet and social media, was associated with both cyberbullying
   victimization and perpetration.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in 10 early
   adolescents reported cyberbullying victimization. Pediatricians,
   parents, teachers, and online platforms can provide education to support
   victims and prevent perpetration for early adolescents at the highest
   risk of cyberbullying.},

Title = {Insights from Social Media on the Patient Experience of Living With Rare
   Eosinophil-Driven Diseases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and
   hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) are driven by persistently high
   eosinophil numbers, causing damage to tissues and organs. As rare
   diseases, they are often underappreciated by healthcare professionals.
   Using a social listening analysis, we collected patient and caregiver
   comments relating to EGPA and HES made on online social platforms
   between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2020, in English, French, and German.
   Results were classified into key areas of interest. In total, 746
   comments with consent to publish were collected mentioning EGPA, and 39
   were identified mentioning HES. The most common theme was sharing of
   personal experiences (EGPA: 77\%; HES: 100\%). Diagnosis, including
   diagnosis delays and misdiagnosis, was mentioned in 33\% of comments for
   EGPA, and 82\% for HES. Other common themes included seeking and giving
   advice, symptoms, and treatments. These insights highlight the views and
   unmet needs of people living with EGPA and HES. Further work should
   improve disease awareness and effective communications among healthcare
   professionals and patients with these conditions.},

Abstract = {The past decade witnesses the unprecedent growth of social media users
   worldwide. People express health related outcomes, information, and
   views on social media platforms. This provides many opportunities to
   utilize the data source for health monitoring and surveillance, and
   digital epidemiology in real time. Personal health mention (PHM) is
   among one of the critical tasks for such purpose. It tries to identify
   whether a person's health condition is mentioned in a sentence. However,
   social media texts contain noises, many creative and novel phrases,
   sarcastic Emoji expressions, and misspellings. This poses challenges to
   detect PHM from social media text. This paper explores the PHM
   identification task for six diseases from twitter using convolutional
   neural network (CNN). Specifically, word embeddings are used to encode
   the twitter text. Then they are fed into CNN structure to train the
   classifier for PHM identification. We also explore how the performance
   of different methods are affected by data imbalance issue and training
   sample size.},

Title = {Using Patient-Generated Health Data From Twitter to Identify, Engage,
   and Recruit Cancer Survivors in Clinical Trials in Los Angeles County:
   Evaluation of a Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Failure to find and attract clinical trial participants
   remains a persistent barrier to clinical research. Researchers
   increasingly complement recruitment methods with social media-based
   methods. We hypothesized that user-generated data from cancer survivors
   and their family members and friends on the social network Twitter could
   be used to identify, engage, and recruit cancer survivors for cancer
   trials.
   Objective: This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of using
   user-reported health data from cancer survivors and family members and
   friends on Twitter in Los Angeles (LA) County to enhance clinical trial
   recruitment. We focus on 6 cancer conditions (breast cancer, colon
   cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer).
   Methods: The social media intervention involved monitoring
   cancer-specific posts about the 6 cancer conditions by Twitter users in
   LA County to identify cancer survivors and their family members and
   friends and contacting eligible Twitter users with information about
   open cancer trials at the University of Southern California (USC) Norris
   Comprehensive Cancer Center. We reviewed both retrospective and
   prospective data published by Twitter users in LA County between July
   28, 2017, and November 29, 2018. The study enrolled 124 open clinical
   trials at USC Norris. We used descriptive statistics to report the
   proportion of Twitter users who were identified, engaged, and enrolled.
   Results: We analyzed 107,424 Twitter posts in English by 25,032 unique
   Twitter users in LA County for the 6 cancer conditions. We identified
   and contacted 1.73\% (434/25,032) of eligible Twitter users (127/434,
   29.3\% cancer survivors; 305/434, 70.3\% family members and friends; and
   2/434, 0.5\% Twitter users were excluded). Of them, 51.4\% (223/434)
   were female and approximately one-third were male. About one-fifth were
   people of color, whereas most of them were White. Approximately
   one-fifth (85/434, 19.6\%) engaged with the outreach messages (cancer
   survivors: 33/85, 38\% and family members and friends: 52/85, 61\%). Of
   those who engaged with the messages, one-fourth were male, the majority
   were female, and approximately one-fifth were people of color, whereas
   the majority were White. Approximately 12\% (10/85) of the contacted
   users requested more information and 40\% (4/10) set up a prescreening.
   Two eligible candidates were transferred to USC Norris for further
   screening, but neither was enrolled.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential of identifying and
   engaging cancer survivors and their family members and friends on
   Twitter. Optimization of downstream recruitment efforts such as
   screening for digital populations on social media may be required.
   Future research could test the feasibility of the approach for other
   diseases, locations, languages, social media platforms, and types of
   research involvement (eg, survey research). Computer science methods
   could help to scale up the analysis of larger data sets to support more
   rigorous testing of the intervention.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: A social media campaign for mothers aimed at reducing indoor
   tanning (IT) by adolescent daughters reduced mothers' permissiveness
   toward IT in an immediate posttest. Whether the effects persisted at 6
   months after the campaign remains to be determined.
   Methods: Mothers (N = 869) of daughters ages 14-17 in 34 states without
   bans on IT byminors were enrolled in a randomized trial. All mothers
   received an adolescent health campaign over 12months with posts on
   preventing IT (intervention) or prescription drug misuse (control).
   Mothers completed a follow-up at 18 months postrandomization measuring
   IT permissiveness, attitudes, intentions, communication, and behavior,
   and support for state bans. Daughters (n = 469; 54.0\%) just completed
   baseline and follow-up surveys.
   Results: Structural equation modeling showed that intervention-group
   mothers were less permissive of IT by daughters {[}unstandardized
   coefficient, -0.17; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -0.31 to -0.03], had
   greater self-efficacy to refuse daughter's IT requests (0.17; 95\% CI,
   0.06-0.29) and lower IT intentions themselves (-0.18; 95\% CI, -0.35 to
   -0.01), and were more supportive of bans on IT by minors (0.23; 95\% CI,
   0.02-0.43) than control-group mothers. Intervention-group daughters
   expressed less positive IT attitudes than controls (-0.16; 95\% CI, 0.31
   to -0.01).
   Conclusions: The social media campaign may have had a persisting effect
   of convincing mothers to withhold permission for daughters to indoor tan
   for 6 months after its conclusion. Reduced IT intentions and increased
   support for bans on IT by minors also persisted among mothers.
   Impact: Social media may increase support among mothers to place more
   restrictions on IT by minors.},

Abstract = {Digital health data, for example from social media or connected devices,
   as well as the artificial intelligence methods to analyze them, are
   profoundly changing the way we approach research in diabetes
   epidemiology. The concepts of deep digital phenotyping and digital
   twins, which are based on the development of large cohort studies of
   extremely well characterized people with diabetes, will make it possible
   to further personalize the monitoring and management of the disease,
   thanks to a better integration of the impact of diabetes on people's
   daily lives. Similarly, the development of digital biomarkers, such as
   vocal biomarkers, will improve the remote monitoring of people with
   diabetes and thus allow the development of the telemonitoring and
   telemedicine of the future. These new opportunities are promising but
   they also come with their share of technical and ethical challenges that
   should not be overlooked.(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {There is a need for wildlife professionals to work together to more
   effectively protect wildlife health; however, collaboration between
   people of different professions and institutions can be challenging. Our
   objective was to examine and compare how the conservation and animal
   health fields share wildlife health data and information in Ontario,
   Canada. Fifty-five (50\%) of 110 invited participants completed an
   online questionnaire about their wildlife health communication network
   over the previous 12 months. The professional communication networks
   (i.e., ego-networks) of practitioners were compared with respect to data
   sharing between institutions and professions. Results showed low levels
   of tie dispersion and high levels of ego-alter similarity. There was
   more data and information sharing occurring between people of different
   institutions than between people of different professions based on
   comparing tie dispersion and ego-alter similarity values for these
   categories. This study highlights opportunities for improved networking
   between wildlife conservation and health practitioners in Ontario.},

Abstract = {Objective To gather preliminary insights through formative research on
   social media usage, and experiences, attitudes and perceptions around
   COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination in three high-risk, underserved
   districts in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Design Cross-sectional mixed-method design.
   Participants 392 adults (361 surveys and 30 in-depth interviews (IDI))
   from districts South, East and Korangi in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Main outcome measures Social media usage and knowledge, perception and
   behaviour towards COVID-19 infection and vaccination.
   Results Using social media was associated with an increased probability
   of getting vaccinated by 1.61 units. Most of the respondents (65\%)
   reported using social media, mainly to watch videos and/or keep in touch
   with family/friends. 84.76\% knew of COVID-19 while 88.37\% knew about
   the COVID-19 vaccination, with 71.19\% reported vaccine receipt; reasons
   to vaccinate included belief that vaccines protect from the virus, and
   vaccination being mandatory for work. However, only 56.7\% of
   respondents believed they were at risk of disease. Of the 54
   unvaccinated individuals, 27.78\% did not vaccinate as they did not
   believe in COVID-19. Despite this, 78.38\% of respondents scored high on
   vaccine confidence. In IDIs, most respondents knew about COVID-19
   vaccines: `This vaccine will create immunity in your body. Therefore, I
   think we should get vaccinated', and over half knew how COVID-19
   spreads. Most considered COVID-19 a serious public health problem and
   thought it important that people get vaccinated. However, there was a
   low-risk perception of self as only a little over half felt that they
   were at risk of contracting COVID-19.
   Conclusion With our conflicting results regarding COVID-19 vaccine
   confidence, that is, high vaccine coverage but low perception of risk to
   self, it is likely that vaccine coverage is more a result of mandates
   and coercion than true vaccine confidence. Our findings imply that
   interactive social media could be valuable in fostering provaccine
   sentiment.},

Title = {Public engagement with health data governance: the role of visuality},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Over the last years, public engagement has become a topic of scholarly
   and policy debate particularly in biomedicine, a field that increasingly
   centres around collecting, sharing and analysing personal data. However,
   the use of big data in biomedicine poses specific challenges related to
   gaining public support for health data usage in research and clinical
   settings. The improvement of public engagement practices in health data
   governance is widely recognised as critical to address this issue. Based
   on OECD guidance, public engagement serves to enhance transparency and
   accountability, and enable citizens to actively participate in shaping
   what affects their lives. For health research initiatives, this provides
   a way to cultivate cooperation and build public trust. Today, the exact
   formats of public engagement have evolved to include approaches (such as
   social media, events and websites) that exploit visualisation mediated
   by emerging information and communication technologies. Much scholarship
   acknowledges the advantages of visuality for public engagement,
   particularly in information-dense and digital contexts. However, little
   research has examined how health data governance actors utilise
   visuality to promote clarity, understandability and audience
   participation. Beyond simply acknowledging the diversity of possible
   formats, attention must also be paid to visualisations' rhetorical
   capacity to convey arguments and ideas and motivate particular audiences
   in specific situations. This paper seeks to address this gap by
   analysing both the approaches and methods of argumentation used in two
   visual public engagement campaigns. Based on Gottweis' analytical
   framework of argumentative performativity, this paper explores how two
   European public engagement facilitators construct contending narratives
   in efforts to make sense of and grapple with the challenges of health
   data sharing. Specifically, we analyse how their campaigns employ the
   three rhetorical elements logos, ethos and pathos, proposed by Gottweis
   to assess communicative practices, intermediated and embedded in
   symbolically rich social and cultural contexts. In doing so, we
   highlight how visual techniques of argumentation seek to bolster
   engagement but vary with rhetorical purposes, as while one points to
   health data sharing risks, the other focuses on benefits. Moreover,
   drawing on digital and visual anthropology, we reflect on how the
   digitalisation of communicative practices impacts visual power.},

   Mediterranean Spain: An Epidemiological Point of View},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The correct management of diseases that are transmitted between wildlife
   and livestock requires a reliable estimate of the pathogen transmission
   rate. The calculation of this parameter is a challenge for
   epidemiologists, since transmission can occur through multiple pathways.
   The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to
   its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles
   for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic
   network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using
   information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven
   fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored
   using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16
   proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social
   network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions,
   including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of
   different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within
   this network. The results show a high connection between species through
   indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of
   new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities
   that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission
   of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be
   playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock.
   The present work shows the need to consider different types of
   methodologies in order to understand the complete functioning of the
   network of interactions at the wildlife/livestock interface. It also
   provides a methodological approach applicable to the management of
   shared diseases.},

Title = {Empowering machine learning models with contextual knowledge for
   enhancing the detection of eating disorders in social media posts},
Journal = {SEMANTIC WEB},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {873-892},
Abstract = {Social networks have become information dissemination channels, where
   announcements are posted frequently; they also serve as frameworks for
   debates in various areas (e.g., scientific, political, and social). In
   particular, in the health area, social networks represent a channel to
   communicate and disseminate novel treatments' success; they also allow
   ordinary people to express their concerns about a disease or disorder.
   The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has developed analytical
   methods to uncover and predict patterns from posts that enable it to
   explain news about a particular topic, e.g., mental disorders expressed
   as eating disorders or depression. Albeit potentially rich while
   expressing an idea or concern, posts are presented as short texts,
   preventing, thus, AI models from accurately encoding these posts'
   contextual knowledge. We propose a hybrid approach where knowledge
   encoded in community-maintained knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata) is
   combined with deep learning to categorize social media posts using
   existing classification models. The proposed approach resorts to
   state-of-the-art named entity recognizers and linkers (e.g., Falcon 2.0)
   to extract entities in short posts and link them to concepts in
   knowledge graphs. Then, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) are utilized
   to compute latent representations of the extracted entities, which
   result in vector representations of the posts that encode these
   entities' contextual knowledge extracted from the knowledge graphs.
   These KGEs are combined with contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT)
   to generate a context-based representation of the posts that empower
   prediction models. We apply our proposed approach in the health domain
   to detect whether a publication is related to an eating disorder (e.g.,
   anorexia or bulimia) and uncover concepts within the discourse that
   could help healthcare providers diagnose this type of mental disorder.
   We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating
   disorders. Our experimental results suggest that combining contextual
   knowledge encoded in word embeddings with the one built from knowledge
   graphs increases the reliability of the predictive models. The ambition
   is that the proposed method can support health domain experts in
   discovering patterns that may forecast a mental disorder, enhancing
   early detection and more precise diagnosis towards personalized
   medicine.},

Title = {Health Information in the Era of Social Media: An Analysis of the Nature
   and Accuracy of Posts Made by Public Facebook Pages for Patients with
   Endometriosis},

Abstract = {Study Objective: To analyze the nature and accuracy of social media
   (Facebook) content related to endometriosis.
   Design: Retrospective content analysis. Setting: Social media platform,
   Facebook.
   Participants: Social media posts on Facebook endometriosis pages.
   Interventions: A search of public Facebook pages was performed using the
   key word ``endometriosis.{''} Posts from the month-long study period
   were categorized and analyzed for accuracy. Two independent researchers
   used thematic evaluation to place posts into the following 11
   categories: educational, emotional support, advocacy, discussion,
   events, humor, promotional, recipes, resources, surveys, and other.
   Posts categorized as educational were further subcategorized and
   reviewed. Each posted fact was cross-referenced in peer-reviewed
   scientific journals to determine whether the claim made was
   evidence-based. Engagement in a post was calculated by taking the sum of
   comments, shares, and reactions.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 53 Facebook pages meeting
   inclusion criteria were identified and 1464 posts from the study period
   were evaluated. Emotional support posts comprised the largest category
   of posts (48\%) followed by educational posts (21\%). Within the
   educational category, the epidemiology and pathophysiology subcategory
   comprised the largest group (42.0\%) followed by the symptom's
   subcategory (19.6\%). Post category had an effect on the amount of post
   engagement (p-value <.001) with emotional posts generating 70\% of the
   overall engagement. The subcategories of the educational posts
   demonstrated a similar effect on engagement (p-value <.001). Posts were
   more engaging if they contained epidemiology and pathophysiology
   information with 44\% of all engagement of educational posts occurring
   within this subcategory. Educational posts were found to be 93.93\%
   accurate. There was no correlation between post engagement and post
   information accuracy (p-value = .312).
   Conclusion: Facebook pages offer emotional support and education to
   people with endometriosis. Most information found in these Facebook
   pages is evidence-based. Clinicians should consider discussing the use
   of Facebook pages with their patients diagnosed with endometriosis. (C)

Title = {Precision health data: Requirements, challenges and existing techniques
   for data security and privacy},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Precision health leverages information from various sources, including
   omics, lifestyle, environment, social media, medical records, and
   medical insurance claims to enable personalized care, prevent and
   predict illness, and precise treatments. It extensively uses sensing
   technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations
   (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between
   the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private
   information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical
   conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage
   of these private information affects the personal life, including
   bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical
   history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are
   of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics
   committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data. Besides,
   the public, who is the data source, always expects the security,
   privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can avoid contributing
   their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as the public
   is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of
   precision health diminishes. Herein, in the light of precision health
   data security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the
   best methods and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and
   thus precision health is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper
   explores the regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and
   domain-specific needs. Then it presents the requirements and
   investigates the associated challenges. Secondly, this paper
   investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine learning methods
   suitable for the computation of precision health data along with their
   usage in relevant health projects. Finally, it illustrates the best
   available techniques for precision health data security and privacy with
   a conceptual system model that enables compliance, ethics clearance,
   consent management, medical innovations, and developments in the health
   domain.},

Title = {Mining Multiplatform Opinions During Public Health Crisis: A Comparative
   Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 21},
Abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases pose a growing threat to human society and
   have sparked extensive public discussions on social media. Although
   numerous efforts have been made in health data mining on social media,
   there is a lack of focus on quantitative comparisons across multiple
   platforms, despite their crucial role in the holistic social
   communication system. This study addresses this gap by developing a
   generalized regression model that considers the distinct attributes of
   social media platforms, including short-text, long-text, and Eastern or
   Western orientation. Using Monkeypox as an application case, this study
   examines differences among platforms based on four factors: user
   characteristics, text topics, text emotion, and text quality. The
   modeling and regression results reveal significant heterogeneity in
   public opinion expressions across different platforms, particularly
   between long-text and short-text platforms. Users on short-text
   platforms are more exposed to diverse information and tend to be
   susceptible to emotionally provocative content. On the other hand, users
   on long-text platforms prefer in-depth discussions and show greater
   receptivity to content infused with positive emotions. This study
   reveals the information bias brought by platform differences and
   contributes to data-driven modeling in social communication systems.},

Title = {Relationships between abstract features and methodological quality
   explained variations of social media activity derived from systematic
   reviews about psoriasis interventions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {35-43},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship among
   abstract structure, readability, and completeness, and how these
   features may influence social media activity and bibliometric results,
   considering systematic reviews (SRs) about interventions in psoriasis
   classified by methodological quality.
   Study Design and Setting: Systematic literature searches about psoriasis
   interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review,
   methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the
   methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension,
   structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were
   analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook
   mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations
   were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any
   potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media
   diffusion.
   Results: We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying
   high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract
   readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although
   there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free
   format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability
   as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods,
   Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on
   their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality:
   a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high
   quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an
   inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results
   in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower
   quality.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability
   must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of
   high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of
   their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader
   social media visibility and article usage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {An annotated data set for identifying women reporting adverse pregnancy

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite the prevalence in the United States of miscarriage {[}1]
   stillbirth {[}2], and infant mortality associated with preterm birth and
   low birthweight {[}3], their causes remain largely unknown {[}4-6]. To
   advance the use of social media data as a complementary resource for
   epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we present a data set of
   6487 tweets that mention miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or
   premature labor, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care, or
   fetal/infant loss in general. These tweets are a subset of 22,912 tweets
   retrieved by applying hand-written regular expressions to a database
   containing more than 400 million public tweets posted by more than
   100,000 women who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter {[}7]. Two
   professional annotators labeled the 6487 tweets in a binary fashion,
   distinguishing those potentially reporting that the user has personally
   experienced the outcome ({''}outcome{''} tweets) from those that merely
   mention the outcome ({''}non-outcome{''} tweets). Inter-annotator
   agreement was kappa = 0.90 (Cohen's kappa). The tweets annotated as
   ``outcome{''} include 1318 women reporting miscarriage, 94 stillbirth,
   591 preterm birth or premature labor, 171 low birthweight, 453 neonatal
   intensive care, and 356 fetal/infant loss in general. These
   ``outcome{''} tweets can be used to explore patient experiences and
   perceptions of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can direct researchers to
   the users' broader timelines-tweets posted by a user over time for
   observational studies. Our past work demonstrates the analysis of
   timelines for selecting a study population {[}8] and conducting a
   case-control study {[}9] of users reporting that their child has a birth
   defect. For larger-scale studies, the full annotated corpus can be used
   to train supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically
   identify additional users reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on
   Twitter. We used the annotated corpus to train feature-engineered and
   deep learning-based classifiers presented in ``A natural language
   processing pipeline to advance the use of Twitter data for digital
   epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes{''} {[}10]. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {Online users frequently rely on social networking platforms to transmit
   public concerns and raise awareness about societal issues. With many
   government organizations actively employing social media data in recent
   times, the need for processing public concerns on social media has
   become a critical topic of interest across academic scholars and
   practitioners. However, the growing volume of social media data makes it
   difficult to process all the issues under a single umbrella, causing to
   overlook the main topic of interest within communication technologies,
   such as privacy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, arguments on
   privacy and health issues exploded on Twitter, with several threads
   centered on contact tracking, health data gathering, and its usage by
   government agencies. To address the challenges of rising data volumes
   and to understand the importance of privacy concerns, particularly among
   users seeking greater privacy protection during this pandemic, we
   conduct a focused empirical analysis of user tweets about privacy. In
   this two-part research, our first study reveals three macro privacy
   issues of discussion distilled from the Twitter corpus, subsequently
   subdivided into 12 user privacy categories. The second study builds on
   the findings of the first study, focusing on the primary difficulties
   highlighted in the macro privacy subjects-contact tracing and digital
   surveillance. Using a document clustering approach, we present
   implications for the focal privacy topics that policymakers, agencies,
   and governments should consider for offering better privacy protections
   and help the community rebuild.},

Title = {Rugby Health and Well-Being Study: protocol for a UK-wide survey with
   health data cross-validation},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Introduction Rugby football (Union and League) provides physical
   activity (PA) with related physical and mental health benefits. However,
   as a collision sport, rugby research and media coverage predominantly
   focus on injuries in elite players while the overall impact on health
   and well-being remains unclear. This study aims to provide a greater
   understanding of the risks and benefits of rugby participation in a
   diverse sample of men and women, current and former rugby Union and
   League players from recreational to the elite level of play. We will
   explore: (1) joint-specific injuries and concussion; (2) joint pain and
   osteoarthritis (OA); (3) medical and mental health conditions; (4) PA
   and sedentary behaviour and (5) well-being (quality of life, flourishing
   and resilience). Methods and analysis The Rugby Health and Well-being
   Study is designed in two phases: (1) a UK-wide cross-sectional survey
   and (2) cross-validation using health register data from Scotland.
   Participants will be at least 16 years old, current or former rugby
   players who have played rugby for at least one season. We will report
   standardised, level of play-, sex- and age-stratified prevalence of
   joint injury, concussion, medical conditions and PA. We will describe
   injury/concussion prevention expectations and protective equipment use.
   Rugby-related factors associated with injury, pain, OA, PA, health and
   well-being will be explored in regression models. We will compare joint
   pain intensity and duration, elements of pain perception and well-being
   between recreational and elite players and further investigate these
   associations in regression models while controlling for confounding
   variables. In the second phase, we will validate self-reported with
   health register data, and provide further information on healthcare use.
   Ethics and dissemination The Yorkshire and the Humber-Leeds East
   Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 19/HY/0377) has approved this
   study (IRAS project ID 269424). The results will be disseminated through
   scientific publications, conferences and social media.},

Title = {Attitudes of Covid-19 patients toward sharing their health data: A
   survey-based study to understand security and privacy concerns},
Journal = {HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background and AimsMany people around the world, especially at the time
   of the Covid-19 outbreak, are concerned about their e-health data. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of patients with
   Covid-19 toward sharing their health data for research and their
   concerns about security and privacy. MethodsThis survey is a
   cross-sectional study conducted through an electronic researcher-made
   questionnaire from February to May 2021. Convenience sampling was
   applied to select the participants and all 475 patients were referred to
   two to Afzalipour and Shahid Bahonar hospitals were invited to the
   study. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 204 patients
   were included in the study and completed the questionnaire. Descriptive
   statistics (frequency, mean, and standard deviation) were used to
   analyze the questionnaire data. SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis.
   ResultsParticipants tended to share information about ``comments
   provided by individuals on websites{''} (68.6\%), ``fitness tracker
   data{''} (64.19\%), and ``online shopping history{''} (63.21\%) before
   death. Participants also tended to share information about ``electronic
   medical records data{''} (36.75\%), ``genetic data{''} (24.99\%), and
   ``Instagram data{''} (24.99\%) after death. ``Fraud or misuse of
   personal information{''} (4.48 {[}+/- 1.27]) was the most common concern
   of participants regarding the virtual world. ``Unauthorized access to
   the account{''} (4.38 {[}+/- 0.73]), ``violation of the privacy of
   personal information{''} (4.26 {[}+/- 0.85]), and ``violation of the
   patient privacy and personal information confidentially{''} (4.26 {[}+/-
   0.85]) were the most of the unauthorized security incidents that
   occurred online for participants. ConclusionPatients with Covid-19 were
   concerned about releasing information they shared on websites and social
   networks. Therefore, people should be made aware of the reliability of
   websites and social media so that their security and privacy are not
   affected.},

Title = {Use of Twitter social media activity as a proxy for human mobility to
   predict the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 at global scale},
Journal = {GEOSPATIAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-24},
Abstract = {As of February 27, 2020, 82,294 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) have been reported since December 2019, including 2,804
   deaths, with cases reported throughout China, as well as in 45
   international locations outside of mainland China. We predict the
   spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID-19 cases at the global level
   during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly
   available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns
   were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users
   who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan,
   China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1,
   2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second
   tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available
   COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases
   reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study
   cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan.
   Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to
   identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to
   respond to COVID-19.
   Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6\%)
   posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days
   after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2
   (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR=
   295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2\%) traveled
   abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases
   reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known
   geolocation coordinates and 74.1\% (40 cases) were reported less than 15
   km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at
   least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's
   users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median
   IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to
   predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as
   COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in
   Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to
   low IDVI (i.e. <= 0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be
   on high alert and develop COVID-19 response plans as soon as permitting.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {53-63},

Abstract = {Background: Digital epidemiology tries to identify diseases dynamics and
   spread behaviors using digital traces collected via search engines logs
   and social media posts. However, the impacts of news on
   information-seeking behaviors have been remained unknown.
   Methods: Data employed in this research provided from two sources, (1)
   Parsijoo search engine query logs of 48 months, and (2) a set of
   documents of 28 months of Parsijoo's news service. Two classes of
   topics, i.e. macrotopics and micro-topics were selected to be tracked in
   query logs and news. Keywords of the macro-topics were automatically
   generated using web provided resources and exceeded 10k. Keyword set of
   micro-topics were limited to a numerable list including terms related to
   diseases and health-related activities. The tests are established in the
   form of three studies. Study A includes temporal analyses of 7
   macro-topics in query logs. Study B considers analyzing seasonality of
   searching patterns of 9 micro-topics, and Study C assesses the impact of
   news media coverage on users' health-related information-seeking
   behaviors.
   Results: Study A showed that the hourly distribution of various
   macro-topics followed the changes in social activity level. Conversely,
   the interestingness of macro-topics did not follow the regulation of
   topic distributions. Among macro-topics, ``Pharmacotherapy{''} has
   highest interestingness level and wider time-window of popularity. In
   Study B, seasonality of a limited number of diseases and health-related
   activities were analyzed. Trends of infectious diseases, such as flu,
   mumps and chicken pox were seasonal. Due to seasonality of most of
   diseases covered in national vaccination plans, the trend belonging to
   ``Immunization and Vaccination{''} was seasonal, as well. Cancer
   awareness events caused peaks in search trends of ``Cancer{''} and
   ``Screening{''} micro-topics in specific days of each year that mimic
   repeated patterns which may mistakenly be identified as seasonality. In
   study C, we assessed the co-integration and correlation between news and
   query trends. Our results demonstrated that microtopics sparsely covered
   in news media had lowest level of impressiveness and, subsequently, the
   lowest impact on users' intents.
   Conclusion: Our results can reveal public reaction to social events,
   diseases and prevention procedures. Furthermore, we found that news
   trends are co-integrated with search queries and are able to reveal
   health-related events; however, they cannot be used interchangeably. It
   is recommended that the user-generated contents and news documents are
   analyzed mutually and interactively.},

Abstract = {The unfolding of the COVID-19 outbreak was an unprecedented and
   unanticipated opportunity to understand how a sudden global shock
   modulates people's online searches when seeking information about their
   emotional well-being. It has also illustrated how public health
   surveillance systems were essential for tracking diseases' spatial and
   temporal dynamics and shaping rapid public policy changes.
   The present paper validates a data mining and processing framework which
   examines how digital epidemiology and machine learning reveal trends in
   human mental health and psychological distress expression variability.
   We present results obtained in two research exploring the relationship
   between Google Trends time-series in the digital surveillance of search
   engines during the pandemic and a selection of social media feeds and
   official UK well-being surveys.
   The generated body of evidence shows how data science can provide
   robust, finely grained, and replicable evidence on mental health
   measures at the population level. In the future, the digital
   surveillance analytics validated here can be rapidly deployed for crisis
   management and allow early detection of distress signals to better
   manage communication and policy action at population level.},

Title = {Social network analysis and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate disease
   transmission in a large, dynamic population: A study of avian
   mycobacteriosis in zoo birds},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {This study combined a social network analysis and whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS) to test for general patterns of contagious spread of a
   mycobacterial infection for which pathways of disease acquisition are
   not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with
   avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430
   birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through
   mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional
   methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium
   (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of
   mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across
   bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the
   source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases
   during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations
   between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as
   determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide
   polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly
   generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes
   clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were
   dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected
   birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant
   (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but
   not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed
   genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by
   chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were
   identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the
   WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their
   host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of
   connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a
   contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.},

Title = {Ethical Views on Sharing Digital Data for Public Health Surveillance:
   Analysis of Survey Data Among Patients},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Digital data, including social media, wearable device data, electronic
   health records, and internet search data, are increasingly being
   integrated into public health research and policy. Because of the
   current issues around public distrust of science and other ethical
   issues in public health research, it is essential that researchers
   conduct ongoing studies assessing people's perceptions around and
   willingness to share digital data. This study aims to examine
   participants' social media use and comfort sharing their data with
   health researchers. One hundred and sixty-one participants with medical
   conditions were recruited through social media paid advertisements and
   referral from a website, and invited to complete surveys on social media
   use and ethical perspectives on data sharing. Eligibility criteria were
   adults 18 years old or older, living in the US, self-reported having
   been diagnosed by a physician with a medical condition, belonging to at
   least one social media platform, using social media at least twice a
   week, and owning a smartphone. Study participants were mostly female,
   White, and with a mean age of 36.31 years. More than one third of
   participants reported being very comfortable sharing electronic health
   data and social media data for personalized healthcare and to help
   others. Findings suggest that participants are very uncomfortable
   sharing their location and text message data with researchers, with
   primary concerns centered around loss of privacy, disclosing private
   information, and that friends, family, and others may find out that they
   shared text messages with researchers. We discuss the implications of
   this research before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, along with its
   potential implications for future collection of digital data for public
   health.},

Abstract = {With over 127 million cases globally, the COVID-19 pandemic marks a
   sentinel event in global health. However, true case estimations have
   been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity,
   asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care.
   Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize,
   and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and
   unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences
   on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop
   and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning
   approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter
   during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the
   public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for
   COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets
   into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were
   then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting
   suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated
   data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for
   classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also
   evaluated model performance. From 4,492,954 tweets collected, the
   unsupervised learning process yielded 3,465 (<1\%) symptom tweets used
   to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11,550). The
   XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62)
   compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After
   re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's
   precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in
   identification of an additional 2,622 symptom-related tweets when
   applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected. Our study used a
   hybrid machine learning approach to enable high precision identification
   of Twitter usergenerated COVID-19 symptom discussions. The model is a
   digital epidemiology tool that can identify social media users who
   selfreport symptoms during the early periods of an outbreak.},

Title = {What users' musical preference on Twitter reveals about psychological
   disorders},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Month = {2023 MAY},
Abstract = {Previous research found a strong relation between the users'
   psychological disorders and their language use in social media posts in
   terms of vocabulary selection, emotional expressions, and psychometric
   attributes. However, although studying the association between
   psychological disorders and musical preference is considered as rather
   an old tradition in the clinical analysis of health data, it is not
   explored through the lens of social media analytics. In this study, we
   investigate which attributes of the music posted on social media are
   associated with mental health conditions of Twitter users. We created a
   large-scale dataset of 1519 Twitter users with six self-reported
   psychological disorders (depression, bipolar, anxiety, panic,
   post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline) and matched with 2480
   control users. We then conduct an observational study to investigate the
   relationship between the users' psychological disorders and their
   musical preference by analyzing lyrics of the music tracks that the
   users shared on Twitter from multiple dimensions including word usage,
   linguistic style, sentiment and emotion patterns, topical interests and
   underlying semantics. Our findings reveal descriptive differences on the
   linguistic and semantic features of music tracks of affected users
   compared to control individuals and among users from different
   psychological disorders. Additionally, we build a feature-based and an
   (explainable) deep learning-based binary classifiers trained on disorder
   and control users and demonstrate that lyrics of the music tracks of
   users on Twitter can be considered as complementary information to their
   published posts to improve the accuracy of the disorder detection task.
   Overall, we find that the music attributes of users on Twitter allow
   inferences about their mental health status.},

Title = {Characterizing Depression Issues on Sina Weibo},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The prevalence of depression has increased significantly over the past
   few years both in developed and developing countries. However, many
   people with symptoms of depression still remain untreated or
   undiagnosed. Social media may be a tool to help researchers and
   clinicians to identify and support individuals who experience
   depression. More than 394,000,000 postings were collected from China's
   most popular social media website, Sina Weibo. 1000 randomly selected
   depression-related postings was coded and analyzed to learn the themes
   of these postings, and a text classifier was built to identify the
   postings indicating depression. The identified depressed users were
   compared with the general population on demographic characteristics,
   diurnal patterns, and patterns of emoticon usage. We found that
   disclosure of depression was the most popular theme; depression
   displayers were more engaged with social media compared to
   non-depression displayers, the depression postings showed geographical
   variations, depression displayers tended to be active during periods of
   leisure and sleep, and depression displayers used negative emoticons
   more frequently than non-depression displayers. This study offers a
   broad picture of depression references on China's social media, which
   may be cost effectively developed to detect and help individuals who may
   suffer from depression disorders.},

Title = {Exposure to Cannabis Marketing in Social and Traditional Media and
   Past-Year Use Among Adolescents in States With Legal Retail Cannabis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine adolescents'
   self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing in states with legalized
   cannabis and its association with past-year cannabis use.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online panel survey of 469
   adolescents aged 15-19 years residing in four states with legal retail
   cannabis for adult use. Adolescents self-reported exposure to cannabis
   marketing on social or traditional media (i.e., outdoor or print) and
   past-year cannabis use. Logistic regression generated estimated odds of
   youths' past-year cannabis use by marketing exposure after adjusting for
   demographic factors and cannabis-related social norms.
   Results: Exposure to cannabis marketing on Facebook, Twitter, and
   Instagram was associated with increased odds of past-year cannabis use
   of 96\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 15\%-234\%), 88\% (95\% CI:
   11\%-219\%), and 129\% (95\% CI: 32\%-287\%), respectively. Odds of
   past-year cannabis use increased by 48\% (95\% CI: 16\%-87\%) with each
   additional social media platform where adolescents reported exposure.
   Conclusions: Despite restrictions that prohibit cannabis advertising on
   social media, adolescents are exposed to cannabis marketing via social
   media, and this exposure is associated with recent cannabis use. States
   should consider further regulation of cannabis marketing on social
   media. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights

Title = {Results and Methodological Implications of the Digital Epidemiology of
   Prescription Drug References Among Twitter Users: Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) Analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Background: Social media is an important information source for a
   growing subset of the population and can likely be leveraged to provide
   insight into the evolving drug overdose epidemic. Twitter can provide
   valuable insight into trends, colloquial information available to
   potential users, and how networks and interactivity might influence what
   people are exposed to and how they engage in communication around drug
   use. Objective: This exploratory study was designed to investigate the
   ways in which unsupervised machine learning analyses using natural
   language processing could identify coherent themes for tweets containing
   substance names. Methods: This study involved harnessing data from
   Twitter, including large-scale collection of brand name (N=262,607) and
   street name (N=204,068) prescription drug-related tweets and use of
   unsupervised machine learning analyses (ie, natural language processing)
   of collected data with data visualization to identify pertinent tweet
   themes. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with coherence score
   calculations was performed to compare brand (eg, OxyContin) and street
   (eg, oxys) name tweets. Results: We found people discussed drug use
   differently depending on whether a brand name or street name was used.
   Brand name categories often contained political talking points (eg,
   border, crime, and political handling of ongoing drug mitigation
   strategies). In contrast, categories containing street names
   occasionally referenced drug misuse, though multiple social uses for a
   term (eg, Sonata) muddled topic clarity. Conclusions: Content in the
   brand name corpus reflected discussion about the drug itself and less
   often reflected personal use. However, content in the street name corpus
   was notably more diverse and resisted simple LDA categorization. We
   speculate this may reflect effective use of slang terminology to
   clandestinely discuss drug-related activity. If so, straightforward
   analyses of digital drug-related communication may be more difficult
   than previously assumed. This work has the potential to be used for
   surveillance and detection of harmful drug use information. It also
   might be used for appropriate education and dissemination of information
   to persons engaged in drug use content on Twitter.},

Abstract = {This study used social network analysis with the aim of establishing the
   importance of units (nodes) of interest and to understand the network
   characteristics of shrimp farming during an epidemic of white spot
   disease (WSD) in the Rayong province of Thailand. A case-control study
   at the farm-level was carried out from October 2014 to May 2015. A total
   of 165 questionnaires from all active farms were used for data analysis.
   Among the active farms used in the sample, network data from 38
   case-farms and 127 control-farms were analyzed, and risk factors were
   determined. We found that farm visitors and post-larvae (PL) provider
   companies are significant factors (P < .05). Given these findings, we
   recommend that farmers control WSD by obtaining PL only from reliable
   sources and regulating farm visits to prevent the spread of WSD. These
   measures can help farmers effectively reduce the risk of WSD occurrence
   and spread.},

Title = {Using Twitter to Better Understand the Spatiotemporal Patterns of Public
   Sentiment: A Case Study in Massachusetts, USA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Twitter provides a rich database of spatiotemporal information about
   users who broadcast their real-time opinions, sentiment, and activities.
   In this paper, we sought to investigate the holistic influence of land
   use and time period on public sentiment. A total of 880,937 tweets
   posted by 26,060 active users were collected across Massachusetts (MA),
   USA, through 31 November 2012 to 3 June 2013. The IBM Watson Alchemy API
   (application program interface) was employed to quantify the sentiment
   scores conveyed by tweets on a large scale. Then we statistically
   analyzed the sentiment scores across different spaces and times. A
   multivariate linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the fixed
   effects of land use and the time period on the variations in sentiment
   scores, considering the clustering effect of users. The results exposed
   clear spatiotemporal patterns of users' sentiment. Higher sentiment
   scores were mainly observed in the commercial and public areas, during
   the noon/evening and on weekends. Our findings suggest that social media
   outputs can be used to better understand the spatial and temporal
   patterns of public happiness and well-being in cities and regions.},

Title = {Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: A
   narrative review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {2021 JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: ``Long COVID{''}, a term coined by COVID-19 survivors,
   describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have
   recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people
   infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the
   need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential
   sequelae of COVID-19.
   The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of
   intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly
   understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries,
   and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors
   experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at
   times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.
   Methods/Results: In this review, by addressing separately each body
   system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post
   COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt
   to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management
   strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative
   impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset
   of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other
   fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive
   dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from
   acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or
   unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers.
   Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to
   contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute
   COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome
   remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.
   Conclusions: Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough
   follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a
   carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19
   survivors holistically. (C) 2021 The British Infection Association.

Abstract = {Background: This paper goes beyond detecting specific themes within
   Zika-related chatter on Twitter, to identify the key actors who
   influence the diffusive process through which some themes become more
   amplified than others.
   Methods: We collected all Zika-related tweets during the 3 months
   immediately after the first U.S. case of Zika. After the tweets were
   categorized into 12 themes, a cross-section were grouped into weekly
   datasets. to capture 12 amplifier/user groups, and analyzed by 4
   amplification modes: mentions, retweets, talkers. and Twitter-wide
   amplifiers.
   Results: We analyzed 3.057,130 tweets in the United States and
   categorized 4997 users. The most talked about theme was Zika
   transmission (similar to 58\%). News media, public health institutions,
   and grassroots users were the most visible and frequent sources and
   disseminators of Zika-related Twitter content. Grassroots users were the
   primary sources and disseminators of conspiracy theories.
   Conclusions: Social media analytics enable public health institutions to
   quickly learn what information is being disseminated, and by whom,
   regarding infectious diseases. Such information can help public health
   institutions identify and engage with news media and other active
   information providers. It also provides insights into media and public
   concerns, accuracy of information on Twitter, and information gaps. The
   study identifies implications for pandemic preparedness and response in
   the digital era and presents the agenda for future research and
   practice. (C) 2018 Association for Professionals in Infection Control

Title = {NIH support of mobile, imaging, pervasive sensing, social media and

   research ethics in the digital age},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Mobile Imaging, pervasive Sensing, Social media and location Tracking
   (MISST) tools used in research are raising new ethical challenges for
   scientists and the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) charged with
   protecting human participants. Yet, little guidance exists to inform the
   ethical design and the IRB's regulatory review of MISST research. MISST
   tools/methods produce personal health data that is voluminous and
   granular and, which may not be subject to policies like the Health
   Information Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA). The NIH Research
   Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) database was used to
   identify the number, nature and scope of MISST-related studies supported
   by the NIH at three time points: 2005, 2010 and 2015. The goal was to:
   1-examine the extent to which the NIH is supporting this research and,
   2-identify how these tools are being used in research. The number of
   funded MISST research projects increased 384\% from 2005 to 2015.
   Results revealed that while funding of MISST research is growing, it
   only represented about 1\% of the total NIH budget in 2015. However, the
   number of institutes, agencies, and centers supporting MISST research
   increased by roughly 50\%. Additionally, the scope of MISST research is
   diverse ranging from use of social media to track disease transmission
   to personalized interventions delivered through mobile health
   applications. Given that MISST research represents about 1\% of the NIH
   budget and is on an increasing upward trajectory, support for research
   that can inform the ethical, legal and social issues associated with
   this research is critical.},

Abstract = {Background: The public increasingly uses social media not only to look
   for information about emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), but also to
   share opinions, emotions, and coping strategies. Identifying the frames
   used in social media discussion about EIDs will allow public health
   agencies to assess public opinions and sentiments.
   Method: This study examined how the public discussed measles during the
   measles outbreak in the United States during early 2015 that originated
   in Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA, through a semantic network analysis
   of the content of around 1 million tweets using KH coder.
   Results: Four frames were identified based on word frequencies and
   co-occurrence: news update, public health, vaccination, and political.
   The prominence of each individual frame changed over the corse of the
   pre-crisis, initial, maintenance, and resolution stages of the outbreak.
   Conclusions: This study proposed and tested a method for assessing the
   frames used in social media discussions about EIDs based on the
   creation, interpretation, and quantification of semantic networks.
   Public health agencies could use social media outlets, such as Twitter,
   to assess how the public makes sense of an EID outbreak and to create
   adaptive messages in communicating with the public during different
   stages of the crisis. (C) 2018 Association for Professionals in

Abstract = {Social media may serve as an important platform for the monitoring of
   population-level opioid abuse in near real-time. Our objectives for this
   study were to (i) manually characterize a sample of opioid-mentioning
   Twitter posts, (ii) compare the rates of abuse/misuse related posts
   between prescription and illicit opiods, and (iii) to implement and
   evaluate the performances of supervised machine learning algorithms for
   the characterization of opio id-related chatter, which can potentially
   automate social media based monitoring in the future.. We annotated a
   total of 9006 tweets into four categories, trained several machine
   learning algorithms and compared their performances. Deep convolutional
   neural networks marginally outperformed support vector machines and
   random forests, with an accuracy of 70.4\%. Lack of context in tweets
   and data imbalance resulted in misclassification of many tweets to the
   majority class. The automatic classification experiments produced
   promising results, although there is room for improvement.},

Title = {Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology of HIV in Sexual and Gender
   Minority American Adolescents and Adults: Feasibility of the Keeping it
   LITE Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: HIV infection rates among sexual minority men and
   transgender individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults,
   remain elevated in the United States despite continued improvement in
   the HIV public health response. However, there remains a knowledge gap
   in understanding the barriers faced by this community in receiving HIV
   care and prevention resources. To address this, the Keeping it LITE
   study was conducted to assess HIV risk factors and barriers to
   preventive treatment in a large national cohort of young sexual minority
   men and transgender individuals at high risk of HIV infection.
   Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling a
   large remote cohort, challenges encountered in recruitment, and
   adjustments made to address these challenges.
   Methods: A large national cohort (n=3444) of young sexual minority men
   and transgender individuals were recruited. Participants were recruited
   via advertisements on social media; social apps for lesbian, gay,
   bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals; print advertising; and
   word-of-mouth. Before enrolling, participants verified their HIV status
   using an at-home HIV test or by providing their own testing
   documentation. Descriptive statistics were generated, and a series of
   logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate demographic differences
   between recruitment methods, HIV testing methods, and enrollment status.
   Results: The Keeping it LITE study was particularly successful in
   recruiting participants via social media, with over half of the
   participants recruited from advertisements on social media platforms
   such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Participants were also
   recruited via word-of-mouth; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
   queer apps (ie, Grindr, Scruff); and print advertisements, and
   participants recruited from these sources tended to be older and have a
   higher risk profile. The study was also successful in recruiting a large
   sample of transgender youth, particularly transgender men and nonbinary
   individuals. At-home HIV testing was acceptable and more heavily used by
   younger participants, although several barriers were encountered and
   overcome in the implementation of this testing. The study had more
   limited success in recruiting participants aged 13-17 years because of
   lower enrollment rates and barriers to advertising on social media
   platforms. The implications of these findings for the future development
   of HIV research and intervention protocols among sexual minorities and
   trans youth are discussed.
   Conclusions: The methods used in the Keeping it LITE study, particularly
   recruitment via social media, were found to be feasible and acceptable
   to participants.},

Title = {Main uses of Instagram in oral health research-A scoping review},
Journal = {HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {2022 MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives: Infodemiology is an emerging field in public health
   research. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the
   literature on the use of Instagram as an infodemiological tool in oral
   health research. Methods: A scoping review approach was carried out.
   MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases, together with medRxiv and
   JMIR Publications platforms, were searched for studies representing oral
   health research which employed Instagram as a tool to obtain at least
   part of the results. Three independent reviewers performed the study
   screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out according to the way
   which Instagram was used in research. Results: We included 30 reports
   describing 28 studies. The approaches for using Instagram in oral health
   research were post's content analysis (13 reports), infoveillance (six
   reports), sample recruitment (five reports) and as a platform to deliver
   an exposure or intervention (six reports). Four reports were published
   in 2019, 13 in 2020 and 13 in 2021. Topics related to patient
   experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and
   ethical compliance were highlighted. Conclusions: We described new
   opportunities in this growing field by the identification of four main
   uses of Instagram in oral health research and encourage dental
   professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge translation in
   this social media. Future studies using Instagram as a data source must
   improve search and evaluation quality. Public Interest Summary:
   Infodemiology (information epidemiology) is a growing field in public
   health research and the interest in Instagram social media has increased
   during the pandemic scenario. On the light of these aspects, a
   literature overview may be important to describe new opportunities for
   researchers. Using a scoping review approach, we found that Instagram
   can be used in oral health research as a source to content analysis and
   information surveillance, as well as a platform to sample recruitment
   and to deliver an exposure or intervention. Topics related to patient
   experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and
   ethical compliance were highlighted in the included studies. Our results
   may help to delineate further research using Instagram and encourage
   dental professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge
   translation in this social media. Finally, future studies using
   Instagram as a data source must improve search and evaluation quality.},

Abstract = {Background:As a psychoactive substance that spans borders and cultures,
   researchers estimate that 600 million people use the areca nut. Despite
   its historical and geographical significance, betel nut use has received
   far less research attention than other stimulants such as tobacco,
   coffee or tea. Scholars have observed that social media platforms have
   significant effects on the promotion and use of addictive
   substances.Objectives:Our study investigates user practices and
   activities on a sample of Instagram posts tagged \#betelnut dating back
   to 2011.Methods:Using social media analytics and hashtag network
   analysis, we examined user practices and activities on a sample of over
   7800 Instagram posts tagged \#betelnut dated between July 2011 to
   February 2019 that were collected in early 2019.Results:Findings
   determined that \#betelnut is a growing topical hashtag on Instagram
   with content that drives social engagement.Importance:Co-occurring
   hashtags with \#betelnut reflect regional language and cultural naming
   conventions that center around the Indian subcontinent and Melanesia.
   The importance of future work in this area is highlighted.},

Title = {Lack of consistency in measurement methods and semantics used for
   network measures in adolescent health behaviour studies using social
   network analysis: a systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 30},
Abstract = {Background Social network analysis (SNA) is often used to examine how
   social relationships influence adolescent health behaviours, but no
   study has documented the range of network measures used to do so. We
   aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health
   behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network
   measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA.
   Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts
   commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the
   network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer
   behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms.
   Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all
   distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included
   articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The
   categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201,
   100\%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6\%) and popularity
   (n=110, 54.7\%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for
   `similarity on popularity' (within the `similarity' category) to 28 for
   the `characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and
   nominated peers' (within the `nature of the relationships' category).
   Using the examples of `social isolation', `group membership',
   `individuals in a central position' (within the `position within the
   network' category) and `nominations of influential peers' (sub within
   the `popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting

Title = {Calisthenics: Epidemiology of Injury Patterns and Their Risk Factors},
Journal = {OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {47-57},
Abstract = {Objective: To quantify the prevalence and nature of injuries and their
   risk factors in calisthenics to, therefore, inform the practitioner what
   to expect from these athletes. Methods: This study was an online
   cross-sectional survey of calisthenics athletes. Data were collected
   online and the survey was distributed via social media over six months
   in 2020. The purpose-built survey consisted of demographic, training and
   loading questions. Participants were provided with an injury definition
   and reported their total number of injuries sustained during
   calisthenics including detailed information on three most significant
   injuries, along with mechanism of injury and risk factors. Multivariate
   regression analyses were used to determine objective factors associated
   with the number of injuries. Results: There were 543 participants
   describing 1104 injuries. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) injury
   prevalence was 4.5 (3.3) per person. Of these injuries, 820 (74.3\%)
   required training modification or treatment. Participants missed a mean
   (SD) 3.4 (5.1) weeks of training and engaged in a mean (SD) 10.9 (9.1)
   health professional consultations. The most common injuries were upper
   leg (24.5\%), ankle/foot (22.8\%) and lumbar spine (19.3\%), with the
   majority being sprains/strains in nature (56.3\%). Mechanism of injury
   included elevated work (27.6\%), overuse (38.0\%) and specific
   calisthenics skills (38.9\%) - such as lumbar (40.6\%) and lower limb
   (40.3\%) extension-based movements. Subjective risk factors included
   load (66.8\%), preparation (55.9\%) and environmental factors (21.0\%).
   Objective risk factors associated with higher numbers of injuries
   included increased years of participation, left leg dominance, increased
   training hours (regardless of training type) and state team
   participation (p<0.05). Conclusion: Practitioners need to be aware that
   calisthenics athletes demonstrate a high proportion of strain/sprain
   injuries involving the lower limb and lumbar spine with causative
   movements being extension-based. Addressing risk factors such as
   loading, preparation, asymmetry, and the environment related to these
   movements are important for the treating practitioner.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Number = {6},
Pages = {551-554},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Context: Injuries are common among high profile players in the National
   Basketball Association (NBA), and could provide an opportunity for
   physicians to provide accurate sports injury information and reliable
   rehabilitation data to the general public in the immediate aftermath.
   Objectives: To evaluate social media trends to investigate public
   interest in athletic injuries in the NBA and to evaluate the length of
   maintained interest in these injuries.
   Methods: The Google Trends tool was used to analyze search data around
   two high profile players-Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson-who suffered
   injuries during the 2019 NBA Finals. The results were compared to the
   expected search forecast derived from an autoregressive integrated
   moving algorithm model.
   Results: Both players were associated with a mean increase of 1,052.4\%
   (standard deviation {[}SD], 703.96\%) in relative search volumes for
   terms related to their injuries. This data showed a significant increase
   in search engine activity related to injuries associated with NBA
   players in the first 6.13 days (SD, 3.14 days) following the injuries,
   marking a substantial timeframe for public engagement.
   Conclusions: Search traffic information may be beneficial to the sports
   medicine community, as social media can provide a platform for patient
   education in a limited timeframe. By increasing patient awareness and
   knowledge regarding athletic injuries, social media can expand the pool
   of potential patients for physicians and surgeons.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Analysis of the Twitter activity on \#Crohn's, identifying
   individuals with interest in Crohn's disease on Twitter.
   Methods: A historic cohort study was conducted about Twitter activity
   evaluation of \#Crohn's analyzed over a period of 9 years. For the
   Twitter analysis, a health-care social media analytics tool, Symplur
   Signals, was adopted.
   Results: From 2011 until 2019, 627,000 tweets of \#Crohn's were
   detected, with 276,380 retweets by 109,937 users; of these users, 32.4\%
   were patient advocates and 12.6\% were doctors. There was a pattern of
   annual peak activity of the \#Crohn's, mainly in May and December, and
   less activity, usually in July. Of all tweets, 52.5\% were categorized
   as positive and 47.5\% as negative.
   Conclusions: Social media, especially Twitter, represents an important
   information tool, but it is still underutilized by gastroenterologists.
   This study suggests a significant interference of international
   awareness campaigns about inflammatory bowel disease in the activity of
   \#Crohn's on Twitter, denoting an increase in debating this topic on the
   platform. Discussions on the subject by health professionals are still
   below expectations regarding the importance of the theme.

Title = {Preventing Internal COVID-19 Outbreaks within Businesses and

   Supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services Decision Making},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study aims at developing and demonstrating in a real case study a
   methodology for supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services in
   the design and assessment of preventive measures to reduce the risks of
   COVID-19 outbreaks within their entities. The proposed methodology
   applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current
   challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2
   among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of
   employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as
   common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion,
   like sharing an office or participating in the same management board.
   The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are
   the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to
   be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the
   designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for
   its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been
   demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing
   promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights
   provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the
   Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of
   the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of
   the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period.
   The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and
   methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for
   preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature
   does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its
   adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is
   still a challenge.},

Abstract = {Background: India reported first laboratory-confirmed case of
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 30 January from Kerala. Media
   surveillance is useful to capture unstructured information about
   outbreaks. We established media surveillance and described the
   characteristics of the COVID-19 cases, clusters, deaths by time, place,
   and person during January-March 2020 in India.
   Methods: The media surveillance team of ICMR-National Institute of
   Epidemiology abstracted data from public domains of India's Central and
   State health ministries, online news and social media platforms for the
   period of January 31 to March 26, 2020. We collected data on person
   (socio-demographics, circumstances of travel/contact, clinical and
   laboratory), time (date/period of reported exposures; laboratory
   confirmation and death) and place (location). We drew epidemic curve,
   described frequencies of cases by age and gender. We described available
   details for identified clusters.
   Results: As of March 26, 2020, India reported 694 (Foreigners = 45, 6\%)
   confirmed COVID-19 cases (Attack rate = 0.5 per million population) and
   17 deaths (Fatality = 2.5\%) from 21 States and 6 Union Territories. The
   cases were higher among 20-59 years of age (60 of 85) and male gender
   (65 of 107). Median age at death was 68 years (Range: 38-85 years). We
   identified 13 clusters with a total of 63 cases and four deaths among
   the first 200 cases.
   Conclusion: Surveillance of media sources was useful in characterizing
   the epidemic in the early phase. Hence, media surveillance should be
   integrated in the routine surveillance systems to map the events
   specially in context of new disease outbreaks.},

Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: In recent years, social media has become a rich source of
   mental health data. However, there is a lack of web-based research on
   the accuracy and validity of self-reported diagnostic information
   available on the web.Objective: An analysis of the degree of
   correspondence between self-reported diagnoses and clinical indicators
   will afford researchers and clinicians higher levels of trust in social
   media analyses. We hypothesized that self-reported diagnoses would
   correspond to validated disorder-specific severity questionnaires across
   2 large web-based samples.Methods: The participants of study 1 were 1123
   adults from a national Qualtrics panel (mean age 34.65, SD 12.56 years;
   n=635, 56.65\% female participants,). The participants of study 2 were
   2237 college students from a large university in the Midwest (mean age
   19.08, SD 2.75 years; n=1761, 75.35\% female participants). All
   participants completed a web-based survey on their mental health, social
   media use, and demographic information. Additionally, the participants
   reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with a series of
   disorders, with the option of selecting ``Yes{''}; ``No, but I should
   be{''}; ``I don't know{''}; or ``No{''} for each condition. We conducted
   a series of ANOVA tests to determine whether there were differences
   among the 4 diagnostic groups and used post hoc Tukey tests to examine
   the nature of the differences.Results: In study 1, for self-reported
   mania (F3,1097=2.75; P=.04), somatic symptom disorder (F3,1060=26.75;
   P<.001), and alcohol use disorder (F3,1097=77.73; P<.001), the pattern
   of mean differences did not suggest that the individuals were accurate
   in their self-diagnoses. In study 2, for all disorders but bipolar
   disorder (F3,659=1.43; P=.23), ANOVA results were consistent with our
   expectations. Across both studies and for most conditions assessed, the
   individuals who said that they had been diagnosed with a disorder had
   the highest severity scores on self-report questionnaires, but this was
   closely followed by individuals who had not been diagnosed but believed
   that they should be diagnosed. This was especially true for depression,
   generalized anxiety, and insomnia. For mania and bipolar disorder, the
   questionnaire scores did not differentiate individuals who had been
   diagnosed from those who had not.Conclusions: In general, if an
   individual believes that they should be diagnosed with an internalizing
   disorder, they are experiencing a degree of psychopathology similar to
   those who have already been diagnosed. Self-reported diagnoses
   correspond well with symptom severity on a continuum and can be trusted
   as clinical indicators, especially in common internalizing disorders
   such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Researchers can put
   more faith into patient self-reports, including those in web-based
   experiments such as social media posts, when individuals report
   diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders. However, replication and
   further study are recommended.},

Abstract = {Pandemics originated by Covid-19 has caused many reactions in the world.
   Each country has reacted with different health policies. In this work,
   we analyze the publications of African citizens on Social networks

Title = {Online Health Monitoring using Facebook Advertisement Audience Estimates
   in the United States: Evaluation Study},

Abstract = {Background: Facebook, the most popular social network with over one
   billion daily users, provides rich opportunities for its use in the
   health domain. Though much of Facebook's data are not available to
   outsiders, the company provides a tool for estimating the audience of
   Facebook advertisements, which includes aggregated information on the
   demographics and interests, such as weight loss or dieting, of Facebook
   users. This paper explores the potential uses of Facebook ad audience
   estimates for eHealth by studying the following: (1) for what type of
   health conditions prevalence estimates can be obtained via social media
   and (2) what type of marker interests are useful in obtaining such
   estimates, which can then be used for recruitment within online health
   interventions.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to understand the limitations
   and capabilities of using Facebook ad audience estimates for public
   health monitoring and as a recruitment tool for eHealth interventions.
   Methods: We use the Facebook Marketing application programming interface
   to correlate estimated sizes of audiences having health-related
   interests with public health data. Using several study cases, we
   identify both potential benefits and challenges in using this tool.
   Results: We find several limitations in using Facebook ad audience
   estimates, for example, using placebo interest estimates to control for
   background level of user activity on the platform. Some Facebook
   interests such as plus-size clothing show encouraging levels of
   correlation (r=.74) across the 50 US states; however, we also sometimes
   find substantial correlations with the placebo interests such as r=.68
   between interest in Technology and Obesity prevalence. Furthermore, we
   find demographic-specific peculiarities in the interests on
   health-related topics.
   Conclusions: Facebook's advertising platform provides aggregate data for
   more than 190 million US adults. We show how disease-specific marker
   interests can be used to model prevalence rates in a simple and
   intuitive manner. However, we also illustrate that building effective
   marker interests involves some trial-and-error, as many details about
   Facebook's black box remain opaque.},

Abstract = {Objective To determine sociodemographic correlates of problematic screen
   use (social media, video games, mobile phones) among a
   racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population-based
   sample of 10-14-year-old early adolescents. Study design We analyzed
   cross-sectional data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
   Study (Year 2, 2018-2020; N = 8753). Multiple linear regression analyses
   were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors
   (age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary language, household income, parental
   education) and adolescent-reported problematic video game (Video Game
   Addiction Questionnaire), social media (Social Media Addiction
   Questionnaire), and mobile phone use (Mobile Phone Involvement
   Questionnaire). Results Boys reported higher problematic video game use
   while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone
   use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher
   scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx
   white adolescents. Having unmarried/unpartnered parents was associated
   with higher problematic social media use. Although higher household
   income was generally protective against problematic video game use,
   these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents (p for
   interaction <0.05). Conclusions Given the sociodemographic differences
   in problematic screen use, digital literacy education strategies can
   focus on at-risk populations, encourage targeted counseling by
   pediatricians, and adapt family media use plans for diverse backgrounds.
   Impact While sociodemographic differences in screen time are documented,
   we examined sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use in a
   large, diverse sample of early adolescents in the US. Boys reported
   higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher
   problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black,
   and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic
   screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Although
   higher household income was generally protective against problematic
   video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white
   adolescents. Beyond time spent on screens, pediatricians, parents, and
   educators should be aware of sociodemographic differences in problematic
   screen use.},

Title = {Towards scaling Twitter for digital epidemiology of birth defects},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Social media has recently been used to identify and study a small cohort
   of Twitter users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes-the
   leading cause of infant mortality-could be observed via their publicly
   available tweets. In this study, we exploit social media on a larger
   scale by developing natural language processing (NLP) methods to
   automatically detect, among thousands of users, a cohort of mothers
   reporting that their child has a birth defect. We used 22,999 annotated
   tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning
   algorithms-feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers-that
   automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user's pregnancy
   outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90\% of
   the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with
   under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class
   imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two
   positive classes: an F-1-score of 0.65 for the ``defect{''} class and
   0.51 for the ``possible defect{''} class. We deployed the classifier on
   20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped
   identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort.
   Contributions of this study include (1) NLP methods for automatically
   detecting tweets by users reporting their birth defect outcomes, (2)
   findings that an SVM classifier can outperform a deep neural
   network-based classifier for highly imbalanced social media data, (3)
   evidence that automatic classification can be used to identify
   additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort, and (4) a
   publicly available corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine
   learning algorithms.},

Title = {A longitudinal and geospatial analysis of COVID-19 tweets during the
   early outbreak period in the United States},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {IntroductionEarly reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths may not
   accurately convey community-level concern about the pandemic during
   early stages, particularly in the United States where testing capacity
   was initially limited. Social media interaction may elucidate public
   reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical
   period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions
   about the perceived severity of the pandemic.MethodsTweets were
   collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords
   related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector
   machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded
   tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms,
   concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal
   relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially
   reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the
   U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering
   were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S.
   cities.ResultsFrom an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed
   459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also
   geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets
   throughout the study period, although there was variation between city
   centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or
   concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as
   temporal distance increased.ConclusionResults from this study suggest
   that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a
   global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations
   among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is
   warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of
   future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these
   findings are needed.},

Title = {Contraceptive care in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: A
   social media survey of contraceptive access, telehealth use and
   telehealth quality},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {123},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: To examine demographic, socioeconomic, and regional
   differences in contraceptive access, differences between telehealth and
   in-person contraception visits, and telehealth quality in the United
   States during the COVID-19 pandemic.Study design: We surveyed
   reproductive-age women about contraception visits during the COVID-19
   pandemic via social media in July 2020 and January 2021. We used
   multivariable regression to examine relationships between age,
   racial/ethnic identity, educational attainment, income, insurance type,
   region, and COVID-19 related hardship, and ability to obtain a
   contraceptive appointment, telehealth vs in-person visits, and
   telehealth quality scores.Results: Among 2031 respondents seeking a
   contraception visit, 1490 (73.4\%) reported any visit, of which 530
   (35.6\%) were telehealth. In adjusted analyses, lower odds of any visit
   was associated with Hispanic/ Latinx and Mixed race/Other identity (aOR
   0.59 {[}0.37-0.94], aOR 0.36 {[}0.22-0.59], respectively), the South,
   Midwest, Northeast (aOR 0.63 {[}0.47-0.85], aOR 0.64 {[}0.46-0.90], aOR
   0.52 {[}CI 0.36-0.75], respectively), no insurance (aOR 0.63
   {[}0.43-0.91]), greater COVID-19 hardship (aOR 0.52 {[}0.31-0.87]), and
   earlier pandemic timing (January 2021 vs July 2020 aOR 2.14
   {[}1.69-2.70]). Respondents from the Midwest and South had lower odds of
   telehealth vs in-person care (aOR 0.63 {[}0.44-0.88], aOR 0.54
   {[}0.40-0.72], respectively). Hispanic/Latinx respondents and those in
   the Midwest had lower odds of high telehealth quality (aOR 0.37
   {[}0.17-0.80], aOR 0.58 {[}0.35-0.95], respectively).Conclusions: We
   found inequities in contraceptive care access, less telehealth use for
   contraception visits in the South and Midwest, and lower telehealth
   quality among Hispanic/Latinx people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Future research should focus on telehealth access, quality, and
   patients' preferences. Implications: Historically marginalized groups
   have faced disproportionate barriers to contraceptive care, and
   telehealth for contraceptive care has not been employed equitably during
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Though telehealth has the potential to improve
   access to care, inequitable implementation could exacerbate existing
   disparities.\& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This

Abstract = {Despite the range of studies examining the relationship between mental
   health and social media data, not all prior studies have validated the
   social media markers against ``ground truth{''}, or validated
   psychiatric information, in general community samples. Instead,
   researchers have approximated psychiatric diagnosis using user
   statements such as ``I have been diagnosed as X{''}. Without ``ground
   truth{''}, the value of predictive algorithms is highly questionable and
   potentially harmful. In addition, for social media data, whilst
   linguistic features have been widely identified as strong markers of
   mental health disorders, little is known about non-textual features on
   their links with the disorders. The current work is a longitudinal study
   during which participants' mental health data, consisting of depression
   and anxiety scores, were collected fortnightly with a validated,
   diagnostic, clinical measure. Also, datasets with labels relevant to
   mental health scores, such as emotional scores, are also employed to
   improve the performance in prediction of mental health scores. This work
   introduces a deep neural network-based method integrating sub-networks
   on predicting affective scores and mental health outcomes from images.
   Experimental results have shown that in the both predictions of emotion
   and mental health scores, (1) deep features majorly outperform
   handcrafted ones and (2) the proposed network achieves better
   performance compared with separate networks.},

   African, Caribbean and Black people in Ontario},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Introduction African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities are
   disproportionately infected by HIV in Ontario, Canada. They constitute
   only 5\% of the population of Ontario yet account for 25\% of new
   diagnoses of HIV. The aim of this study is to understand underlying
   factors that augment the HIV risk in ACB communities and to inform
   policy and practice in Ontario. Methods and analysis We will conduct a
   cross-sectional study of first-generation and second-generation ACB
   adults aged 15-64 in Toronto (n=1000) and Ottawa (n=500) and collect
   data on sociodemographic information, sexual behaviours, substance use,
   blood donation, access and use of health services and HIV-related care.
   We will use dried blood spot testing to determine the incidence and
   prevalence of HIV infection among ACB people, and link participant data
   to administrative databases to investigate health service access and
   use. Factors associated with key outcomes (HIV infection, testing
   behaviours, knowledge about HIV transmission and acquisition, HIV
   vulnerability, access and use of health services) will be evaluated
   using generalised linear mixed models, adjusted for relevant covariates.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and approved by
   the following Research Ethics Boards: Toronto Public Health, Ottawa
   Public Health, Laurentian University; the University of Ottawa and the
   University of Toronto. Our findings will be disseminated as community
   reports, fact sheets, digital stories, oral and poster presentations,
   peer-reviewed manuscripts and social media.},

Abstract = {Background: Social media not only provide platforms for the public to
   obtain information about a disease but also allow them to share their
   opinions and experiences about it.
   Methods: This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from
   over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles
   outbreak.
   Results: News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4\%), followed
   by personal opinions (33.7\%), resources (19.4\%), personal experiences
   (2.5\%), and questions (1.6\%). Susceptibility was the most discussed
   health belief (21.8\%), followed by cues to action (18.9\%) and severity
   (13.0\%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss
   severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to
   offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely
   to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were
   more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources
   such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more
   likely to link to emerging news websites.
   Conclusions: Understanding who posts what on social media during an
   infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better
   assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide
   timely and effective information. (C) 2019 Association for Professionals

Abstract = {The analysis of domestic pig movements has become useful to understand
   the disease spread patterns and epidemiology, which facilitates the
   development of more effective animal diseases control strategies. The
   aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics
   of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the
   contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine
   fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the
   National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network
   analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered
   premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also
   created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises
   movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average
   diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path
   length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world
   structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55\%).
   Backyard producers made up 89\% of the network premises, and the top 2\%
   of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50\% of the movements. The
   highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of
   the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was
   in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF)
   disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of
   network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented
   the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and
   parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to
   improve its procedures and update the disease control and management
   policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based
   surveillance.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewMen who have sex with men (MSM) have been previously
   shown to be at increased risk for meningococcal disease compared to
   other men. We summarized the global epidemiology and public health
   response to meningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM.Recent FindingsAt
   least ten outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease among MSM have
   been reported since 2001. Investigation of and response to outbreaks
   among MSM have often been hampered by an inability to identify
   epidemiologic links among cases, and the target population recommended
   for vaccination has been expanded over time in many outbreaks. Unique
   communication methods, including the use of apps and social media, have
   been used during some outbreaks to identify close contacts and to
   communicate health messages. Although HIV-infected MSM have a higher
   risk of sporadic meningococcal disease in the USA, other factors are
   likely contributing to outbreaks among MSM. An increase in urethritis
   due to Neisseria meningitidis has recently been reported in US men,
   though its role in meningococcal disease transmission among MSM remains
   unclear.SummaryMeningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM raise questions
   regarding possible unique risk factors in this population. The role of
   HIV infection and mode of N. meningitidis transmission are being
   investigated to provide further insights into meningococcal disease and
   outbreaks in this population. Vaccination remains the primary prevention
   and control strategy during meningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM.},

Abstract = {Crisis informatics has examined how institutions and individuals seek,
   communicate, and curate information in response to crises. The public's
   communication and perception of risks on social media remain
   understudied. In this study, we report a qualitative analysis of public
   perceptions of risks and risk management measures on Reddit during the
   Zika crisis, an emerging epidemic associated with high uncertainty
   regarding pathology, epidemiology, and broad consequences. We found two
   types of perceived risks: ones directly caused by the Zika virus, and
   ones potentially introduced by authorities' risk management measures.
   Risk perceptions unfolded along multiple dimensions beyond the imminent
   and personal level. Reddit users discussed in a speculative way to
   foresee various risks in the long nun or at larger geographical scales.
   We discuss the multidimensionality and speculative nature of risk
   perception on social media, and derive implications for crisis
   informatics research and public health research and practice.},

Abstract = {Due to improved efficiency and reduced cost of viral sequencing,
   molecular cluster analysis can be feasibly utilized alongside existing
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention strategies. The goal of
   this paper is to elucidate how HIV molecular cluster and social network
   analyses are being integrated to implement HIV response interventions.
   We searched PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases for
   studies incorporating both HIV molecular cluster and social network
   data. We identified 32 articles that combined analyses of HIV molecular
   sequences and social or sexual networks. All studies were descriptive.
   Six studies described network interventions informed by molecular and
   social data but did not fully evaluate their efficacy. There is no
   current standard for incorporating molecular and social network analyses
   to inform interventions or data demonstrating its utility. More research
   must be conducted to delineate benefits and best practices for
   leveraging molecular data for network-based interventions.},

Abstract = {Background: This study aimed to use social network analysis (SNA)
   indicators and clique analysis to investigate collaboration between
   different departments and research centers in Journal of Research in
   Medical Sciences (JRMS) in 2012-2016. Materials and Methods: The study
   was a scientometric study using micro-and macro-indicators of SNA to
   investigate the performance of departments and research centers in JRMS.
   The population consisted of 1073 articles published in JRMS in
   2012-2016. Ravar Matrix, UCINET, and VOSviewer software were used for
   data analysis. Results: According to the productivity and triple
   centrality indicators, ``Department of Epidemiology and
   Biostatistics,{''} ``Department of Pathology,{''} and Department of
   ``Internal Medicine{''} allocated the first three ranks. Analyzing the
   cliques of co-authorship network for departments and research centers
   showed that this network consists of 19 cliques with at least 7 members
   in each clique. Furthermore, only 30 nodes (8.90\% of all nodes in the
   network) had the presence in minimum clique size of at least 7.
   Conclusion: Given the importance and position of scientific
   collaboration in medical research and its effect on other performance
   indicators such as efficiency, effectiveness, and number of citations,
   it is necessary for policy-makers to propose new strategies for
   improving scientific collaboration.},

Abstract = {Background: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among Inuit
   in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to better understand
   the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using
   whole-genome sequencing.
   Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in
   Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within
   clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with
   detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm.
   Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the
   WGS data analysis.
   Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified,
   all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all
   cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster,
   2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading
   events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was
   linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further
   transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An
   algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events
   demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95\% confidence
   interval, .97-1.0).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely
   residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house,
   combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant
   factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic
   community.},

Title = {Electronic cigarettes: Emerging trends and research hotspots},
Journal = {TOBACCO INDUCED DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION Research on electronic cigarettes is an emerging field,
   with the number of articles in this field noted to have grown
   exponentially over recent years. We used a bibliometric analysis method
   (co-word analysis) to analyze the emerging trends and research hotspots
   in this field.
   METHODS Publication data on electronic cigarettes from 2010 to 2018 were
   retrieved and downloaded from the PubMed database. Theme trends and
   knowledge structures were analyzed on the relevant research fields of
   electronic cigarettes by using a biclustering analysis, strategic
   diagram analysis, and social network analysis methods. Research hotspots
   were extracted and compared from three periods.
   RESULTS Core topics that have continuously develop between the years
   2010 and 2018 include: tobacco use cessation devices; tobacco products;
   tobacco use cessation devices/adverse effects; smoking prevention and
   adverse effects; electronic nicotine delivery systems/economics; and
   public health. Some currently undeveloped topics that could be
   considered as new future research directions include: tobacco use
   disorder/therapy; tobacco use disorder/epidemiology;
   students/psychology; students/statistics and numerical data; adolescent
   behavior/psychology; nicotine/toxicity; nicotinic
   agonists/administration and dosage; and electronic nicotine delivery
   systems/legislation and jurisprudence.
   CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that some currently immature topics in
   strategic coordinates and emerging hotspots in social network graphs can
   be used as future research directions.},

Title = {Harnessing Tweets for Early Detection of an Acute Disease Event},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a thunderstorm asthma
   outbreak on 21 November 2016, resulting in over 8,000 hospital
   admissions by 6 p.m. This is a typical acute disease event. Because the
   time to respond is short for acute disease events, an algorithm based on
   time between events has shown promise. Shorter the time between
   consecutive incidents of the disease, more likely the outbreak. Social
   media posts such as tweets can be used as input to the monitoring
   algorithm. However, due to the large volume of tweets, a large number of
   alerts may be produced. We refer to this problem as alert swamping.
   Methods: We present a four-step architecture for the early detection of
   the acute disease event, using social media posts (tweets) on Twitter.
   To curb alert swamping, the first three steps of the algorithm ensure
   the relevance of the tweets. The fourth step is a monitoring algorithm
   based on time between events. We experiment with a dataset of tweets
   posted in Melbourne from 2014 to 2016, focusing on the thunderstorm
   asthma outbreak in Melbourne in November 2016. Results: Out of our 18
   experiment combinations, three detected the thunderstorm asthma outbreak
   up to 9 hours before the time mentioned in the official report, and five
   were able to detect it before the first news report. Conclusions: With
   appropriate checks against alert swamping in place and the use of a
   monitoring algorithm based on time between events, tweets can provide
   early alerts for an acute disease event such as thunderstorm asthma.},

Title = {Identifying Key Topics Bearing Negative Sentiment on Twitter: Insights
   Concerning the 2015-2016 Zika Epidemic},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {78-96},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: To understand the public sentiment regarding the Zika virus,
   social media can be leveraged to understand how positive, negative, and
   neutral sentiments are expressed in society. Specifically, understanding
   the characteristics of negative sentiment could help inform federal
   disease control agencies' efforts to disseminate relevant information to
   the public about Zika-related issues.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the public sentiment
   concerning Zika using posts on Twitter and determine the qualitative
   characteristics of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed.
   Methods: Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used to analyze
   the sentiment of tweets concerning Zika. A supervised machine learning
   classifier was built to classify tweets into 3 sentiment categories:
   positive, neutral, and negative. Tweets in each category were then
   examined using a topic-modeling approach to determine the main topics
   for each category, with focus on the negative category.
   Results: A total of 5303 tweets were manually annotated and used to
   train multiple classifiers. These performed moderately well (F1
   score=0.48-0.68) with text-based feature extraction. All 48,734 tweets
   were then categorized into the sentiment categories. Overall, 10 topics
   for each sentiment category were identified using topic modeling, with a
   focus on the negative sentiment category.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how sentiment expressed within
   discussions of epidemics on Twitter can be discovered. This allows
   public health officials to understand public sentiment regarding an
   epidemic and enables them to address specific elements of negative
   sentiment in real time. Our negative sentiment classifier was able to
   identify tweets concerning Zika with 3 broad themes: neural defects,Zika
   abnormalities, and reports and findings. These broad themes were based
   on domain expertise and from topics discussed in journals such as
   Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and Vaccine. As the majority of
   topics in the negative sentiment category concerned symptoms, officials
   should focus on spreading information about prevention and treatment

Title = {Trend of influenza vaccine Facebook posts in last 4 years: a content
   analysis},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {361-367},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Decreasing immunization rates may be partly due to
   antivaccine campaigns and other sources of misinformation available on
   social media, particularly on Facebook. Given the potential impact of
   this medium for communicating vaccine-related information, it is
   important to analyze the trend of information available on Facebook.
   Methods: We searched Facebook on August 15, 2018 to obtain posts
   containing relevant health information on influenza vaccine in years
   2015-2018. We collected information regarding nature of the post (eg,
   pro-, antivaccine, and informational), number of shares and likes
   received, and ease of reading for each post. We evaluated these
   characteristics by year and type of post in our exploratory analyses.
   Results: The proportion of pro-vaccine posts has increased compared to
   antivaccine and informational posts since 2016. There was no correlation
   between ease of reading and popularity of posts. Although the language
   of antivaccine posts was complex, they were shared and liked more than
   pro-vaccine posts. The pro-vaccine personal post by a nurse was the most
   popular in our study (shared over 46,000 times) in 2018.
   Conclusions: Though the number of pro-vaccine posts increased,
   antivaccine posts remained more popular. The government agency may use
   an emotive personal family-oriented message to promote vaccination. (C)

Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 AUG},
Abstract = {Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and cultural
   sector, challenged by classical swine fever (CSF). Recently, the
   National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control
   the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination
   against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig
   premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement
   restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the
   network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected,
   recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were
   used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from
   2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard
   farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most
   influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and
   4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3
   shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy
   resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement
   restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement
   restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and
   markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the
   best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available,
   highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the
   network. When comparing the static network with its temporal
   counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in
   the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required
   4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS
   surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most
   at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal
   information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This
   information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance
   reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.},

Title = {Facebook ads to the rescue? Recruiting a hard to reach population into
   an Internet-based behavioral health intervention trial},
Journal = {INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN
   MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH},
Year = {2019},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: Facebook (FB) ads are touted as a way to facilitate
   recruitment of hard to reach participants into digital health research
   but the evidence has been mixed. This study aimed to empirically
   evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of paid ads for recruitment
   into a national trial testing an Internet-based, coached intervention
   for parents of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
   Methods: Post hoc analysis of FB ad data and Google analytics on the
   online trial consent site (myStudies) were conducted on 11 campaigns
   employing static image/text ads. Standard metrics (e.g., click through
   rate, cost per 1000 impressions, cost per consent) were calculated and
   descriptive statistics comparing FB ad engagement and enrolled
   participants over time were conducted.
   Results: Ad campaigns were active for a combined 115 days over 58 weeks
   resulting in 1533 links to the online recruitment site. During the ad
   campaigns, the mean rate of enrolment was 1 participant every 2 days.
   The first 3 ad campaigns were the most cost-effective. Mean cost per
   enrolment was \$19.27 (Canadian dollars).
   Conclusions: FB ads were efficient and cost-effective in broad
   dissemination of trial information, but more research is needed to
   explore the impact of saturation (how often ads are posted), design
   (what is in the ad), and individual determinants (who is likely to
   respond to an ad) on converting FB ad engagement into enrolment.
   Avoiding a reductionist approach to analytics will help ensure
   appropriate and targeted strategies remain the priority for digital
   health research recruitment through social media.},

Title = {The information and support needs of patients living with inflammatory
   bowel disease: A qualitative study},
Journal = {CHRONIC ILLNESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {356-369},
Month = {2022 JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives
   To explore patients' experiences of living with inflammatory bowel
   disease (IBD) with a focus on their information and support needs.
   Methods
   Qualitative interview study involving adults diagnosed with IBD
   recruited through social media. Interviews were audio recorded,
   transcribed and data were analysed thematically.
   Results
   Interviews with 15 patients (9 females, 6 males) highlighted how
   misdiagnosis or hesitation to diagnose had caused frustration and
   anxiety. Once diagnosed, only a few participants received detailed
   information about IBD from their doctor. Negative experiences shared on
   social media caused initial anxiety, as individuals assumed that they
   may have a similar experience, yet online communities enabled insights
   into the experiences of others, helping patients adjust to living with
   IBD. Participants described both positive and negative impacts of living
   with IBD, including improved confidence and periods of anxiety.
   Discussion: Our findings highlight the importance of clear information
   and support from health professionals, as well as the benefits of online
   communities for ongoing support. At the point of diagnosis, patients
   would benefit from information about what IBD is, as well as how it may
   impact day to day life from doctors so that social media is not the only
   source of initial information about IBD.},

Title = {Information exchange networks for chronic diseases in primary care
   practices in Germany: a cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMC PRIMARY CARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Coordination of care requires information exchange between
   health workers. The structure of their information exchange networks may
   influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of
   this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in
   primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021.
   As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused
   on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2
   diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure
   (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of
   connections, density and centralization for each of the health
   conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive
   findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in
   primary care practices.
   Results: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25
   practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of
   information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic
   diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected
   networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low
   hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with
   low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17
   for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information
   sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members.
   Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with
   nurses and pharmacists.
   Conclusions: This study identified four types of information exchange
   structures, which provides a practical tool for management and
   improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer
   connections and could hardly be considered a network.},

Abstract = {Background: The Internet nowadays is the most popular and time-saving
   tool for gaining a lot of information. This is true for health knowledge
   also, because almost everyone is keen to know about their health
   disorders, treatment, healthcare centers and also how to stay healthy.
   There was a felt need to study the prevalence among the population of
   the access to Internet for health-related information. Objectives: The
   main objective of this study was to investigate the different health
   information seeking behaviors among the population of the Kingdom of
   Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional, observational and
   population-based study in Majmaah city. Based on the (prevalence rate =
   50\%) previous articles, the sample size was calculated equal to 384.
   Data was collected by pre-tested, close ended, interviewee-based
   questionnaire to know people behavior in seeking health information.
   Results: The majority are using the internet as a source of health
   information (71.3\%, n=321) followed by friends who are health workers
   (31.3\%, n=140). Internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, etc.) being the
   most commonly used to gain health information through Internet (68.2\%,
   n=307) followed by Social media (9.8\%, n=44). Conclusion: This study
   revealed that internet use for seeking health information is in
   increasing manner with intemet search engines (Google, Yahoo...etc)
   being the most used source. We conclude that internet use for seeking
   health information is still a common behavior in the population.},

Abstract = {Introduction Health services generate large amounts of routine health
   data (eg, administrative databases, disease registries and electronic
   health records), which have important secondary uses for research.
   Increases in the availability and the ability to access and analyse
   large amounts of data represent a major opportunity for conducting
   studies on the possible relationships between complex diseases. The
   objective of this study will be to evaluate the design, methods and
   reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected
   health data for investigating the link between cancer and
   neurodegenerative diseases.
   Methods and analysis This is the protocol for a meta-research study. We
   registered the study protocol within the Open Science Framework:
   https://ostio/h2qjg. We will evaluate observational studies (eg, cohort
   and case-control) conducted using routinely collected health data for
   investigating the associations between cancer and neurodegenerative
   diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis/motor neuron disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis
   and Parkinson's disease). The following electronic databases will be
   searched (from their inception onwards): MEDLINE, Embase and Web of
   Science Core Collection. Screening and selection of articles will be
   conducted by at least two researchers. Potential discrepancies will be
   resolved via discussion. Design, methods and reporting characteristics
   in each article will be extracted using a standardised data extraction
   form. Information on general, methodological and transparency items will
   be reported. We will summarise our findings with tables and graphs (eg,
   bar charts, forest plots).
   Ethics and dissemination Due to the nature of the proposed study, no
   ethical approval will be required. We plan to publish the full study in
   an open access peer-reviewed journal and disseminate the findings at
   scientific conferences and via social media. All data will be deposited
   in a cross-disciplinary public repository.},

Title = {Estimating County-Level Overdose Rates Using Opioid-Related Twitter
   Data: Interdisciplinary Infodemiology Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: There were an estimated 100,306 drug overdose deaths between
   April 2020 and April 2021, a three-quarter increase from the prior
   12-month period. There is an approximate 6-month reporting lag for
   provisional counts of drug overdose deaths from the National Vital
   Statistics System, and the highest level of geospatial resolution is at
   the state level. By contrast, public social media data are available
   close to real-time and are often accessible with precise
   coordinates.Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess whether
   county-level overdose mortality burden could be estimated using
   opioid-related Twitter data.Methods: International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD) codes for poisoning or exposure to overdose at the county
   level were obtained from CDC WONDER. Demographics were collected from
   the American Community Survey. The Twitter Application Programming
   Interface was used to obtain tweets that contained any of the 36 terms
   with drug names. An unsupervised classification approach was used for
   clustering tweets. Population-normalized variables and polynomial
   population-normalized variables were produced. Furthermore, z scores of
   the Getis Ord Gi clustering statistic were produced, and both these
   scores and their polynomial counterparts were explored in regression
   modeling of county-level overdose mortality burden. A series of linear
   regression models were used for predictive modeling to explore the
   interpretability of the analytical output.Results: Modeling overdose
   mortality with normalized demographic variables alone explained only
   7.4\% of the variability in county-level overdose mortality, whereas
   this was approximately doubled by the use of specific demographic and
   Twitter data covariates based on a backward selection approach. The
   highest adjusted R2 and lowest AIC (Akaike Info Criterion) were obtained
   for the model with normalized demographic variables, normalized z scores
   from geospatial analyses, and normalized topic counts (adjusted
   R2=0.133, AIC=8546.8). The z scores of the Getis Ord Gi statistic
   appeared to have improved utility over population-normalization alone.
   In this model, median age, female population, and tweets about web-based
   drug sales were positively associated with opioid mortality. Asian race
   and Hispanic ethnicity were significantly negatively associated with
   county-level burdens of overdose mortality.Conclusions: Social media
   data, when transformed using certain statistical approaches, may add
   utility to the goal of producing closer to real-time county-level
   estimates of overdose mortality. Prediction of opioid-related outcomes
   can be advanced to inform prevention and treatment decisions. This
   interdisciplinary approach can facilitate evidence-based funding
   decisions for various substance use disorder prevention and treatment
   programs.},

   a medium primarily used by adolescents and young adults under 30 years.
   TikTok is thus an appropriate social media platform with which to
   examine discussions of anxiety among this age cohort. In this
   exploratory mixed-methods study we aimed to evaluate the scope of
   anxiety content available on TikTok in English in December 2021, and to
   further develop methods for analysing TikTok content. Methods We
   analysed a data set of 147 TikToks with the hashtag \#anxiety. The data
   set consisted both of metadata and TikTok videos. This data set
   represented 18\% of all TikToks featuring the hashtag \#anxiety in
   December 2021. We examined the following research questions (RQs). RQ1:
   What are the creator identities reflected in the final data set in this
   study?; RQ2: What are the metadata characteristics of the TikToks in the
   final data set?; RQ3: What are the anxiety content themes in the final
   data set?; and RQ4: What are the characteristics of the data set based
   on an anxiety management reference checklist? This study involves public
   data that can reasonably be observed by strangers. This study does not
   include any identifiable human participants.Results Influencers were the
   most frequent creator identity in our data set. Influencers comprised
   85.5\% of the 147 TikToks in our final data set. We coded 79 female
   (54\%) and 45 male (31\%) influencers. We found male influencers created
   the most played (mean 8,114,706), and most liked (mean 1,510,585)
   TikToks. We found content themes varied by influencer gender. The
   notable findings were (a) the greater use of humour by males (22.7\%
   males; n=10, and females 12.6\%; n=10); and (b) inspiration (38.7\%;
   males n=17; and 13.9\%; females n=11). Among female influencers, we
   identified self-disclosure as the most common theme (n= 40 and 50.7\%
   compared with n=11 and 25\% male influencers). Overall, we found limited
   references to evidence -based anxiety self-care content in our final
   data set.Discussion We suggest that the TikToks in our data set were
   primarily directed at raising awareness of and de -stigmatising anxiety
   symptoms. TikTok anxiety content may be viewed by adolescents for
   emotional self -regulation beyond evidence-based health information
   seeking. Self-disclosure on TikTok may also provide symptomatic relief
   to adolescents with anxiety. We suggest that gender is a salient
   consideration when considering TikTok content. Conclusions Our findings
   are consistent with existing literature on adolescent social media use
   and epidemiological data on anxiety. This research also provides
   methodological insights for researchers and clinicians seeking to
   understand TikTok, and to develop engaging content targeted at the
   specific concerns and preferences of adolescent TikTok consumers.},

Abstract = {Aim The main purpose of our study is to determine the current research
   status of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and birth defects by
   means of co-word analysis, to explore the hot spots and weak points of
   current research, and to provide ideas and opinions for follow-up
   researchers.
   Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge
   structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published
   literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH
   terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix
   Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to
   the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was
   performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence
   matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network
   analysis (SNA).
   Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of
   all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were
   identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the
   strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods
   and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In
   contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology
   is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research. For SNA
   results, the position status of each component is described by the
   center value.
   Conclusions By providing a quantitative bibliometric study, it can help
   with the overall command of the latest topic and guide researchers in
   their new projects.},

Title = {Identifying Protective Health Behaviors on Twitter: Observational Study
   of Travel Advisories and Zika Virus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Background: An estimated 3.9 billion individuals live in a location
   endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. The emergence of Zika virus
   in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and
   caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown
   promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and
   understanding other diseases.
   Objective: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus
   outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and
   self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of
   disease-travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in
   Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for
   disease modeling.
   Methods: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning
   classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386
   English-language tweets in the context of travel, including
   considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored
   demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change
   their behavior compared with control groups.
   Results: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and
   linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or
   considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared
   with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences
   between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more
   discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels
   of exposure to Zika-related information.
   Conclusions: Our findings have implications for informing the ways in
   which public health organizations communicate with the public on social
   media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in
   which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious
   diseases.},

Abstract = {We aimed to assess the prevalence, content structure and, psychological
   comorbidity of PIU in Russian adolescents. In addition, the design of
   our research provided an opportunity to compare demographic and
   psychological patterns of different forms of PIU: generalized (PIUgen)
   and specific problematic video game use (PUgame), as well as problematic
   social media use (PUsocial). Methods: This is a one-stage
   cross-sectional observational study of school sampling in three major
   Siberian cities. A total of 4514 schoolchildren aged 12-18 (mean age
   14.52 +/- 1.52 years) were surveyed. The Chen Internet Addiction Scale,
   the Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents, and the Social Media Disorder
   Scale were used to identify PIU and its types. Results: The prevalence
   of PIUgen among adolescents in Central Siberia was 7.2\%; the prevalence
   of PUgame was 10.4\%; the prevalence of PUsocial was 8.0\%. The results
   of structural equation modelling, as well as the correlation analysis
   data, suggest two possible patterns of psychosocial problems with
   PIU-the first one is characteristic of both PIUgen and PUsocial. The
   second one-which is significantly different-is characteristic of PUgame.
   Conclusions: Urban adolescents in Central Siberia do not differ
   significantly from their Asian and European peers. Our findings support
   the concept of rejecting the term ``generalized PIU{''} as a single
   psychological construct.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To assess the association between sexual orientation and screen
   use (screen time and problematic screen use) in a demographically
   diverse national sample of early adolescents in the United
   States.Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from year 2 of the
   Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 10,339, 2018-2020,
   ages 10-14 years). Multiple linear regression analyses esti-mated the
   association between sexual orientation and recreational screen time, as
   well as problematic use of video games, social media, and mobile
   phones.Results: In a sample of 10,339 adolescents (48.7\% female, 46.0\%
   racial/ethnic minority), sexual minority (compared to heterosexual)
   identification was associated with 3.72 (95\% CI 2.96-4.47) more hours
   of daily recreational screen time, specifically more time on television,
   YouTube videos, video games, texting, social media, video chat, and
   browsing the internet. Possible sexual minority identification
   (responding ``maybe{''} to the sexual minority question) was associated
   with 1.58 (95\% CI 0.92-2.24) more hours of screen time compared to
   heterosexual identification. Sexual minority and possible sexual
   minority identification were associated with higher problematic social
   media, video games, and mobile phone use. Conclusions: Sexual minority
   adolescents spend a disproportionate amount of time engaging in
   screen-based activities, which can lead to problematic screen use.\&

Title = {A Twitter discourse analysis of negative feelings and stigma related to
   NAFLD, NASH and obesity},
Journal = {LIVER INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {2295-2307},

Abstract = {Background People with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and
   non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are stigmatized, partly since
   `non-alcoholic' is in the name, but also because of obesity, which is a
   common condition in this group. Stigma is pervasive in social media and
   can contribute to poorer health outcomes. We examine how stigma and
   negative feelings concerning NAFLD/NASH and obesity manifest on Twitter.
   Methods Using a self-developed search terms index, we collected
   NAFLD/NASH tweets from May to October 2019 (Phase I). Because
   stigmatizing NAFLD/NASH tweets were limited, Phase II focused on obesity
   (November-December 2019). Via sentiment analysis, >5000 tweets were
   annotated as positive, neutral or negative and used to train machine
   learning-based Natural Language Processing software, applied to 193 747
   randomly sampled tweets. All tweets collected were analysed.
   Results In Phase I, 16 835 tweets for NAFLD and 2376 for NASH were
   retrieved. Of the annotated NAFLD/NASH tweets, 97/1130 (8.6\%) and
   63/535 (11.8\%), respectively, related to obesity and 13/1130 (1.2\%)
   and 5/535 (0.9\%), to stigma; they primarily focused on scientific
   discourse and unverified information. Of the 193 747 non-annotated
   obesity tweets (Phase II), the algorithm classified 40.0\% as related to
   obesity, of which 85.2\% were negative, 1.0\% positive and 13.7\%
   neutral.
   Conclusions NAFLD/NASH tweets mostly indicated an unmet information need
   and showed no clear signs of stigma. However, the negative content of
   obesity tweets was recurrent. As obesity-related stigma is associated
   with reduced care engagement and lifestyle modification, the main
   NAFLD/NASH treatment, stigma-reducing interventions in social media
   should be included in the liver health agenda.},

Title = {Quality and Reliability Analysis of Essential Tremor Disease Information
   on Social Media: The Study of YouTube},
Journal = {TREMOR AND OTHER HYPERKINETIC MOVEMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Background: YouTube has evolved into an important educational tool and
   information source for patients and their families. YouTube videos have
   the potential to influence the patients' health-related diagnosis and
   treatment decision-making. We aimed to evaluate the quality and
   usefulness of videos on essential tremor available on YouTube using
   quantitative instruments.Methods: Video searches were performed by
   typing the keywords `essential tremor', `postural tremor', `action
   tremor', `essential tremor hand', and `essential tremor head' into the
   YouTube search bar. The top 30 videos were reviewed for each search
   term. The videos were analyzed by two independent raters using the
   DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems. Qualitative and
   quantitative data were recorded for each video.Results: A total of 83
   videos were analyzed. The mean DISCERN score was 41.96 out of 75
   possible points, and the mean GQS score was 2.97 out of 5 possible
   points. Twelve percent of the videos were categorized as very poor,
   38.6\% as poor, 20.5\% as fair, 19.3\% as good, and 9.6\% as excellent.
   The videos containing qualitative content features, such as clear
   information, symptoms, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, treatment
   response, epidemiology, diagrams, and radiological images had
   significantly higher DISCERN and GQS scores.Discussion: We consider that
   reliable and useful content is not provided on YouTube for individuals
   searching for information on essential tremor. We listed the
   best-quality videos on this topic as a reference for healthcare
   practitioners and patients. Patients should always verify information
   provided in such videos through more reliable sources.},

Title = {The 100 Most Mentioned Glaucoma Articles Online With Highest Altmetric
   Attention Scores},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GLAUCOMA},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precis: Characteristics of the most mentioned glaucoma articles on the
   internet were analyzed, allowing a better understanding of the
   dissemination of glaucoma research to the general public.
   Purpose: The aim was to determine the 100 most mentioned articles on the
   internet in the field of glaucoma and analyze their characteristics.
   Materials and Methods: We identified the top 100 glaucoma articles with
   the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), an automatically calculated
   metric for monitoring social media. Each article was evaluated for
   several characteristics including year of publication, title, journal
   name, journal impact factor (IF), article topic, article type,
   affiliation, and online mentions (news, blog, policy, Twitter, Facebook,
   etc.). Correlation analysis was conducted for AAS with these
   characteristics.
   Results: The selected 100 articles came from 44 journals with more than
   half (56\%) published in ophthalmology-specific journals. There was no
   significant correlation between IF and number of articles in a specific
   journal or AAS (P > 0.1), but the number of articles in the top 100 was
   higher for ophthalmology journals with a higher IF (P < 0.05). Original
   study was the most common study type (87\%), of which clinical
   observation study was the most common subgroup (40\%). Epidemiology/risk
   factor and basic science were the most common article topics (each
   24\%), followed by medical treatment (13\%). Article topics regarding
   medical treatment had a significantly greater AAS than other topics (P <
   0.05). Of the top 5 articles, more than half (60\%) were related to
   ``Lifestyle choice{''} topics.
   Conclusions: There was no association between journal IF and AAS,
   consistent with previous studies. 90\% of journals that had articles in
   the top 100 had a Twitter page. ``Lifestyle choice{''} activities and
   other modifiable risk factors attracted significant online attention
   regarding glaucoma studies, with two of the top three most mentioned
   articles related to dietary intake. The present study thus provides a
   better understanding of online engagement with glaucoma research and the
   dissemination of this research to the general public.},

Abstract = {Background and AimsInternet and social media platforms have become an
   unprecedented source for sharing self-experience, potentially allowing
   the collection and integration of health data with patient experience.
   StuffThatWorks (STW) is an online open platform that applies machine
   learning and the power of crowdsourcing, where patients with chronic
   medical conditions can self-report and compare their individual outcomes
   using a structured online questionnaire. We aimed to conduct a
   cross-sectional, international, crowdsourcing, artificial-intelligence
   (AI) web-based study of patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
   self-reporting their outcomes. MethodsA proprietary STW Bayesian
   inference model was built to measure improvement in CD severity (on
   scale of 1-5) for each treatment and ranked treatments using
   effectiveness. The effectiveness of first-line biological treatments was
   analyzed by multiple comparisons and by calculating odds ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals for each treatment pair. ResultsWe included 7593
   self-reported CD patients for the analysis. Most of the participants
   were female (75.8\%) and from English-speaking countries (95.7\%).
   Overall, anti-TNF drugs were the most reported tried treatment (52.8\%).
   Infliximab (IFX) was ranked as the most effective treatment by the STW
   effectiveness model followed by bowel surgery (second), adalimumab (ADA,
   third), ustekinumab (UST, 4rd), and vedolizumab (VDZ, fifth). In paired
   comparison analyses, IFX was most effective, ADA had similar
   effectiveness compared to UST and all three were more effective than
   VDZ. ConclusionWe present the first online crowdsourcing AI
   platform-based study of self-reported treatment effectiveness in CD.
   Net-based crowdsourcing patient-reported outcome platforms can
   potentially help both clinicians and patients select the best treatment

Title = {Monitoring Physical Activity Levels Using Twitter Data: Infodemiology
   Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Background: Social media technology such as Twitter allows users to
   share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions online. The growing body of
   social media data is becoming a central part of infodemiology research
   as these data can be combined with other public health datasets (eg,
   physical activity levels) to provide real-time monitoring of
   psychological and behavior outcomes that inform health behaviors.
   Currently, it is unclear whether Twitter data can be used to monitor
   physical activity levels.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of
   using Twitter data to monitor physical activity levels by assessing
   whether the frequency and sentiment of physical activity-related tweets
   were associated with physical activity levels across the United States.
   Methods: Tweets were collected from Twitter's application programming
   interface (API) between January 10, 2017 and January 2, 2018. We used
   Twitter's garden hose method of collecting tweets, which provided a
   random sample of approximately 1\% of all tweets with location metadata
   falling within the United States. Geotagged tweets were filtered. A list
   of physical activity-related hashtags was collected and used to further
   classify these geolocated tweets. Twitter data were merged with physical
   activity data collected as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System. Multiple linear regression models were fit to
   assess the relationship between physical activity-related tweets and
   physical activity levels by county while controlling for population and
   socioeconomic status measures.
   Results: During the study period, 442,959,789 unique tweets were
   collected, of which 64,005,336 (14.44\%) were geotagged with latitude
   and longitude coordinates. Aggregated data were obtained for a total of
   3138 counties in the United States. The mean county-level percentage of
   physically active individuals was 74.05\% (SD 5.2) and 75.30\% (SD 4.96)
   after adjusting for age. The model showed that the percentage of
   physical activity-related tweets was significantly associated with
   physical activity levels (beta=.11; SE 0.2; P<.001) and age-adjusted
   physical activity (beta=.10; SE 0.20; P<.001) on a county level while
   adjusting for both Gini index and education level. However, the overall
   explained variance of the model was low (R-2 =.11). The sentiment of the
   physical activity-related tweets was not a significant predictor of
   physical activity level and age-adjusted physical activity on a county
   level after including the Gini index and education level in the model
   (P>.05).
   Conclusions: Social media data may be a valuable tool for public health
   organizations to monitor physical activity levels, as it can overcome
   the time lag in the reporting of physical activity epidemiology data
   faced by traditional research methods (eg, surveys and observational
   studies). Consequently, this tool may have the potential to help public
   health organizations better mobilize and target physical activity
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective Screen time and self-esteem have been shown to be important
   correlates of eating disorders in adolescence. However, there is an
   absence of longitudinal studies that distinguish between time-varying
   factors, accounting for parallel developmental changes and common
   underlying vulnerability. Design A total of 3,801 adolescents were
   administered self-report measures, annually, over the course of 5 years.
   The association of screen time (social media use, television watching,
   video gaming) on eating related symptoms was analyzed using a
   longitudinal Bayesian multilevel path analysis framework. Self-esteem
   was examined as a mediating factor in this model. This study
   investigated direct and indirect associations at between-person,
   concurrent within-person, and lagged-within-person levels, while
   controlling for gender. Results The findings revealed that all types of
   screen time exposure were significantly associated with eating related
   symptoms at between and within-person levels. A significant association
   at the lagged-within person level was only revealed for social media
   use. Self-esteem was found to be a significant mediating factor between
   screen time and eating related symptoms. Conclusion An increase in
   social media use one year was associated with increased of eating
   related symptoms two years later through lower self-esteem. Implications
   for prevention are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss an issue linked to data-sharing regimes in
   patient-powered, social-media-based networks, namely that most of the
   data that patient users share are not used to research scientific issues
   or the patient voice. This is not a trivial issue, as participation in
   these networks is linked to openness in data sharing, which would
   benefit fellow patients and contributes to the public good more
   generally. Patient-powered research networks are often framed as
   disrupting research agendas and the industry. However, when data that
   patients share are not accessible for research, their epistemic
   potential is denied. The problem is linked to the business models of the
   organisations managing these networks: models centred on controlling
   patient data tend to close networks with regard to data use. The
   constraint on research is at odds with the ideals of a sharing, open and
   supportive epistemic community that networks' own narratives evoke. This
   kind of failure can create peculiar scenarios, such as the emergence of
   the `digital orphans' of Internet research. By pointing out the issue of
   data use, this paper informs the discussion about the capacity of
   patient-powered networks to support research participation and the
   patient voice.},

   social media: The case of YouTube},
Journal = {MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Month = {2022 SEP},
Abstract = {Background: YouTube (YT) has grown into the largest online video
   platform across the world. Known to have more than two billion users of
   all ages, YT also serves as an important educational tool and
   information source for patients and their families. YT videos have the
   potential to influence patients' understanding of their di-agnoses and
   treatment decision-making.Methods: Videos were identified using the
   keywords ``multiple sclerosis,{''} ``multiple sclerosis treatment,{''}
   ``re-lapsing remitting MS,{''} and ``central demyelinating disorder{''}
   in the YT search bar. For each search term, the top 30 videos were
   reviewed. The videos were analyzed by two independent raters using the
   DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems. Qualitative and
   quantitative data were recorded for each video.Results: A total of 99
   videos were analyzed. The mean DISCERN score was 43.44 out of 75
   possible points, and the mean Global Quality Scale (GQS) score was 2.77
   out of 5 possible points. Of all the videos, 14.1, 29.3, 15.2, and
   29.3\% were categorized as very poor, poor, moderate, good, and
   excellent, respectively. Videos that included qualitative features such
   as clear information; information related to symptomatology, etiology,
   diagnosis, treatment, treatment response, and epidemiology; and diagrams
   and radiological images had significantly higher scale scores. Audience
   engagement parameters were significantly higher for videos containing
   animation, treatment response, and radiological images.Conclusion: We
   maintain that sufficient, reliable, and useful content is not provided
   for those seeking information on YT about MS. Everyone seeking
   information about MS should always verify information provided in YT
   videos using more reliable sources of information. Video producers
   should optimize their videos to contain high-quality and reliable data
   and to attract larger audiences.},

Abstract = {Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional
   gastrointestinal disease. The prevalence of IBS is estimated to be
   11.2\% worldwide and even though it is not a life-threatening condition,
   it affects the quality of life and results in an economic burden on the
   healthcare system. According to the Rome III criteria, IBS is described
   as abdominal pain that improves with defecation and the onset of the
   pain is associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency that
   cannot be explained by any biochemical or structural abnormality. Aim:
   To document the epidemiology of IBS and its associated risk factors in
   the central region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A
   cross-sectional study conducted in the central region of Saudi Arabia,
   carried out by distributing an online self-administered semi-structured
   questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed online in social media
   and websites. The sample size was 426 participants with a precision of
   +/- 5\% and 95\% confidence interval (CI). The questionnaire included
   demographic characters such as age, gender, occupation, and marital
   status. The questionnaire also included body mass index (BMI), smoking,
   family history of IBS, Rome III criteria for diagnosing IBS, and
   Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression.
   Results: A total of 426 (230 {[}54\%] male and 196 {[}46\%] female)
   participants were enrolled in the study. According to Rome III criteria,
   130 had IBS and the prevalence was 30.5\%. Univariate analysis showed
   that gender, anxiety, depression, and low physical activity are
   statistically significant variables with symptomatic IBS (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: In this study, a high prevalence of IBS in the Central Saudi
   Arabia population was observed along with the presence of some
   modifiable risk factors, yet, the sample size was small which shows the
   need for more studies in this area particularly on the general
   population.},

Title = {Self-learning on COVID-19 among medical students in Bhutan: A
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {2021 JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Bhutan lacks a medical school and all medical students are
   trained in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. When the COVID-19 pandemic
   led to the closure of medical schools in these countries in March-April
   2020, the medical students were repatriated to Bhutan. Upon return, they
   were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This
   study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning
   and their attitude towards participation in government's health response
   to COVID-19.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had
   returned to the country. The survey was conducted through an online
   questionnaire while the students were in facility quarantine. The sample
   size calculated was 129 and convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was
   assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Knowledge was considered
   ``good{''} if the cumulative score was >= 80\%, ``satisfactory{''} if >=
   60-79\% and ``poor{''} if <60\%. Correlation between knowledge score and
   duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation
   coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to
   participate in the national COVID-19 response was tested using rating
   scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1.
   Results: 120 medical students responded to the survey (response rate =
   93\%). Eighty-eight (74\%) had good knowledge, 28 (23\%) had
   satisfactory knowledge and only four (3\%) had poor knowledge on
   COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of
   transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local
   epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilation and
   on home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated
   with the duration of clinical clerkship they had undertaken (r = 0.326,
   p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites
   (102, 85\%), television (94, 78\%) and newspapers (76, 63\%). The
   majority (78, 65\%) were willing to participate in the government's
   COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The
   fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported by eight students (7\%).
   Conclusions: Medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and had
   self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The
   students held positive attitude towards participation in the
   government's COVID-19 response.},

Title = {Who tweets what about personalised medicine? Promises and concerns from
   Twitter discussions in Denmark},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Digital health data are seen as valuable resources for the development
   of better and more efficient treatments, for instance through
   personalised medicine. However, health data are information about
   individuals who hold opinions and can challenge how data about them are
   used. Therefore it is important to understand public discussions around
   reuse of digital health data. Social media have been heralded as
   enabling new forms of public engagement and as a place to study social
   issues. In this paper, we study a public debate on Twitter about
   personalised medicine. We explore who participates in discussions about
   personalised medicine on Twitter and what they tweet about. Based on
   user-generated biographies we categorise users as having a `Professional
   interest in personalised medicine' or as `Private' users. We describe
   how users within the field tweet about the promises of personalised
   medicine, while users unaffiliated with the field tweet about the
   concrete realisation of these ambitions in the form of a new
   infrastructure and express concerns about the conditions for the
   implementation. Our study serves to remind people interested in public
   opinion that Twitter is a platform used for multiple purposes by
   different actors and not simply a bottom-up democratic forum. This study
   contributes with insights relevant to policymakers wishing to expand
   infrastructures for reuse of health data. First, by providing insights
   into what is discussed about health data reuse. Second, by exploring how
   Twitter can be used as a platform to study public discussions about
   reuse of health data.},

Title = {Discussions of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter},

Abstract = {Background Experiences typically considered private, such as,
   miscarriages and preterm births are being discussed publicly on social
   media and Internet discussion websites. These data can provide timely
   illustrations of how individuals discuss miscarriages and preterm
   births, as well as insights into the wellbeing of women who have
   experienced a miscarriage. Here we aim to characterise how users discuss
   the topic of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends
   and drivers, and describe the perceived emotional state of women who
   have experienced a miscarriage. Methods We obtained 291 443 Twitter
   postings on miscarriages and preterm births from January 2017 through
   December 2018. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to identify
   major topics of discussion. We applied time series decomposition methods
   to assess temporal trends and identify major drivers of discussion.
   Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional content of 7282 personal
   miscarriage disclosure tweets into the following non-mutually exclusive
   categories: grief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation,
   annoyance, and neutral. Results Topics in our data fell into eight
   groups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure, politics,
   healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu vaccine and ectopic
   pregnancies. Political discussions around miscarriages were largely due
   to a misunderstanding between abortions and miscarriages. Grief and
   annoyance were the most commonly expressed emotions within the
   miscarriage self-disclosures; 50.6\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   49.1, 52.2) and 16.2\% (95\% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings increased with
   celebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of prescribed medications
   and outrage over the high rate of preterm births in the United States.
   Miscarriage disclosures by celebrities also led to disclosures by women
   who had similar experiences. Conclusions This study suggests that
   increase in discussions of miscarriage on social media are associated
   with several factors, including celebrity disclosures. Additionally,
   there is a misunderstanding of the potential physical, emotional and
   psychological impacts on individuals who lose a pregnancy due to a
   miscarriage.},

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of STDs in China: based
   on the GM (1,1) model},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Background COVID-19 and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are two
   very important diseases. However, relevant researches about how COVID-19
   pandemic has impacted on the epidemiological trend of STDs are limited
   in China. This study aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on STDs in
   China and proposed relevant recommendations to be used in bettering
   health. Methods The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea
   in China from 2008 to 2020 were collected. Grey Model (1,1) were
   established to predict the incidence of STDs with the incidence data of
   these three STDs from 2013 to 2018 considering the impact of policies in
   China, respectively. We then calculated the predictive incidence of each
   STD in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by the established Model. And we estimated
   the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiological changes of
   STDs by analyzing the difference between the absolute percentage error
   (APE) of the predictive incidence and actual rate in 2019 and 2020.
   Results The incidence of HIV infection and syphilis showed a trend of
   increase from 2008 to 2019 in China, but that for gonorrhea was
   fluctuant. Of note, the incidence of these three STDs decreased
   significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The APE of HIV
   infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in 2020 (20.54\%, 15.45\% and 60.88\%)
   were about 7 times, 4 times and 2 times of that in 2019 (2.94\%, 4.07\%
   and 30.41\%). The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea
   would be 5.77/100,000, 39.64/100,000 and 13.19/100,000 in 2021 based on
   our model. Conclusions The epidemiological trend of STDs in China was
   significant influenced by COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to balance
   the control of COVID-19 and timely management of STDs during the
   COVID-19 epidemic to prevent or reduce the poor outcome among COVID-19
   patients with STDs. New management strategies on STDs, such as
   leveraging social media, online medical care, rapid self-testing, timely
   diagnosis and treatment guarantee and balance of medical resources for
   STDs management should be adapted in the context of the long-term
   effects of COVID-19.},

Title = {Dataset of motivational factors for using mobile health applications and

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We created and carried out a cross-sectional anonymous structured
   questionnaire on what motivates users of mobile health applications and
   wearables to share their collected health related data. The
   questionnaire was distributed online in English, French, and Norwegian.
   In addition, a flyer with information of where to locate the online
   questionnaire was distributed during a Swiss health conference. We used
   snowball sampling and encouraged participants to forward the
   questionnaires to friends, family, and others. Data were collected
   between October 2018 and March 2020. 58.1 \% (n = 473) responded to the
   English survey, 34.3 \% (n = 279) responded to the French survey, and
   7.6 \% (n = 62) responded to the Norwegian survey. The questionnaire
   contained 38 questions divided into seven themes: Background and health
   goals, Wearables and sensors, Mobile applications, Logging of health
   data, Data sharing-and integration, Social media and entertainment, and
   Demographics (age, gender, country of origin, chronic disease status,
   and chronic disease caretaker status). Answer options were single
   answer, multiple-choice, open-ended, or on a 4-point Likert scale.
   Questions were defined based on 16 in-person interviews with people
   without any chronic disorder, people with diabetes, and people with
   sickle cell disease. All questions were optional. Data were collected
   from 814 participants. All answers to the open-ended questions have been
   translated into English. This dataset is especially interesting for
   researchers interesting in what motivates people with and without
   chronic dis-ease across countries to use mHealth tools and share their
   collected health data. Only a subset of variables has been analyzed so
   far and new research questions on motivation can potentially be answered
   using this dataset.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Predicting the number of article citations in the field of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with the 100 top-cited
   articles since 2014: a bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
   neurodevelopmental disorder in children or early adolescents with an
   estimated worldwide prevalence of 7.2\%. Numerous articles related to
   ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had
   ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number
   of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis
   (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100
   most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject
   headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations.
   Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100
   most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded.
   Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of
   article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social
   network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for
   providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the
   MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation
   coefficients (CC).
   Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were
   research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most
   productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the
   United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most
   articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child
   and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms
   were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations
   (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were
   excluded because they do not have MeSH terms).
   Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to
   display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in
   predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top
   100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and
   other academic disciplines.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {105-129},
Abstract = {With the ubiquitous use of location-based services, large-scale
   individual-level location data has been widely collected through
   location-awareness devices. Geoprivacy concerns arise on the issues of
   user identity de-anonymization and location exposure. In this work, we
   investigate the effectiveness of geomasking techniques for protecting
   the geoprivacy of active Twitter users who frequently share geotagged
   tweets in their home and work locations. By analyzing over 38,000
   geotagged tweets of 93 active Twitter users in three U.S. cities, the
   two-dimensional Gaussian masking technique with proper standard
   deviation settings is found to be more effective to protect user's
   location privacy while sacrificing geospatial analytical resolution than
   the random perturbation masking method and the aggregation on traffic
   analysis zones. Furthermore, a three-dimensional theoretical framework
   considering privacy, analytics, and uncertainty factors simultaneously
   is proposed to assess geomasking techniques. Our research offers
   insights into geoprivacy concerns of social media users' georeferenced
   data sharing for future development of location-based applications and
   services.},

Title = {Assessing Vulnerability to Surges in Suicide-Related Tweets Using Japan
   Census Data: Case-Only Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: As the use of social media becomes more widespread, its
   impact on health cannot be ignored. However, limited research has been
   conducted on the relationship between social media and suicide. Little
   is known about individuals' vulnerable to suicide, especially when
   social media suicide information is extremely prevalent.Objective: This
   study aims to identify the characteristics underlying individuals'
   vulnerability to suicide brought about by an increase in suicide-related
   tweets, thereby contributing to public health. Methods: A case-only
   design was used to investigate vulnerability to suicide using individual
   data of people who died by suicide and tweet data from January 1, 2011,
   through December 31, 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Japanese
   government statistics, and tweet data were provided by a commercial
   service. Tweet data identified the days when suicide-related tweets
   surged, and the date-keyed merging was performed by considering 3 and 7
   lag days. For the merged data set for analysis, the logistic regression
   model was fitted with one of the personal characteristics of interest as
   a dependent variable and the dichotomous exposure variable. This
   analysis was performed to estimate the interaction between the surges in
   suicide-related tweets and personal characteristics of the suicide
   victims as case-only odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% CIs. For the
   sensitivity analysis, unexpected deaths other than suicide were
   considered.Results: During the study period, there were 159,490 suicides
   and 115,072 unexpected deaths, and the number of suicide-related tweets
   was 2,804,999. Following the 3-day lag of a highly tweeted day, there
   were significant interactions for those who were aged 40 years or
   younger (OR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.03-1.15), male (OR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.07-1.18),
   divorced (OR 1.11, 95\% CI 1.03 1.19), unemployed (OR 1.12, 95\% CI
   1.02-1.22), and living in urban areas (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.17 1.35). By
   contrast, widowed individuals had significantly lower interactions (OR
   0.83, 95\% CI 0.77-0.89). Except for unemployment, significant
   relationships were also observed for the 7-day lag. For the sensitivity
   analysis, no significant interactions were observed for other unexpected
   deaths in the 3-day lag, and only the widowed had a significantly larger
   interaction than those who were married (OR 1.08, 95\%Conclusions: This
   study revealed the interactions of personal characteristics associated
   with susceptibility to suicide-related tweets. In addition, a few
   significant relationships were observed in the sensitivity analysis,
   suggesting that such an interaction is specific to suicide deaths. In
   other words, individuals with these characteristics, such as being
   young, male, unemployed, and divorced, may be vulnerable to surges in
   suicide-related tweets. Thus, minimizing public health strain by
   identifying people who are vulnerable and susceptible to a surge in
   suicide-related information on the internet is necessary.},

Abstract = {Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other
   birth defects. We hypothesized that the Latin America Zika epidemic
   resulted in pregnant women and their partners adopting behavioral
   changes to limit risk, leading them to forego travel to Zika-affected
   locations. We evaluated this hypothesis by studying travelers' intent
   and behavior through Twitter data related to babymoon: a holiday taken
   by parents-to-be before their baby is born. We found the odds of
   mentioning representative Zika-affected locations in \#babymoon tweets
   dropped significantly (Odds ratio: 0.29, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.40) after the
   Zika-microcephaly association became well-known. This result was further
   corroborated through a content analysis of \#babymoon tweets mentioning
   Zika-affected locations, which identified if the Twitter user was
   physically present in the Zika-affected locations. Conversely, we found
   a small but statistically insignificant increase in the odds of
   mentioning Zika-free locations from \#babymoon tweets (Odds Ratio: 1.11,
   95\% CI: 0.97-1.27) after the Zika-microcephaly association became
   well-known.},

Abstract = {Twitter helps us to know what is happening in the world and what people
   are talking right now. Every day, millions of Twitteraties tweet
   something personal or impersonal to express their emotions and valuable
   knowledge. In the health domain, disclosure of personal health
   information will have a long-term effect to common individuals either
   directly or indirectly, which emphasize the presence of unrealistic
   social boundaries and the need of sensitivity analysis in social media.
   The proposed Tweedle framework was built with 100K tweets extracted
   based on a set of 20 health-related cyber-keywords. The framework of
   Tweedle was bounded with Regret Theory for tweet annotation, content and
   contextual feature scores for feature selection and various machine
   learning algorithms for sensitivity classification. The tweets annotated
   in accordance with Regret Theory by domain experts of Amazon Mechanical
   Turkresulted in 61.5\% of sensitive tweets with health data. The context
   and content-oriented features scoresare introduced in terms of Primary /
   Secondary tweet score, Named Entity Recognition Score of tweets, Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF), Cyber-KeywordRatioin
   tweets, hashtag mentions, user mentions as features for
   classification.The Tweedle experimented Regret Theory in combination
   with various classifiers like Support Vector Machine, Na ve Bayes,
   Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural
   Network + Long Short-Term Memory for sensitivity classificationin health
   domain tweets.The training and testing results proved RNN + LSTM as the
   better performing model to identify tweets with sensitive health data.

Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The Sangrur population-based cancer registry, Punjab state,
   India experienced several challenges in confirming residence as well as
   updating the follow-up status of cancer cases, which is critical for
   accurately labelling incidence and providing cancer survival. This study
   presents innovative field strategies adopted by the Sangrur
   population-based cancer registry for residence confirmation and updating
   follow-up status of cancer cases. Methods: A network was developed with
   the involvement of local community members to validate the address and
   follow-up status of cancer cases. In addition, social media was used to
   trace patients who were loss to followup.Results: The Sangrur
   population-based cancer registry was unable to trace a total of 31
   cancer cases. After implementing innovative field methods, 26 (83.9\%)
   cases were successfully traced back; while 5 (16.1\%) cases were
   untraced despite several efforts. A majority of these 31 cases were from
   urban areas (93.5\%) compared to rural (6.5\%). True Caller with the
   help of WhatsApp contributed significantly by tracing 9 cases (34.6\%);
   followed by 4 cases (15.4\%) traced with the help of a postman, 3 cases
   each (11.5\%) with the electoral list and gas agency personnel, and 2
   cases (7.7\%) through medical shops. Also, 2 cases (7.7\%) were traced
   with the help of treating hospital while Facebook and property tax
   office traced 1 case (3.8\%) each.Conclusion: By engaging with the local
   community, and with the use of social media, the patient's residence and
   follow-up status can be updated. Due to this method, accurate labelling
   of the incidence can be achieved.},

Title = {Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy, Confidence, and Public Engagement:
   A Global Social Listening Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Background: Monitoring public confidence and hesitancy is crucial for
   the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Social media listening (infoveillance) can
   not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess
   the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions.
   Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and
   public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination.
   Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June
   and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United
   Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts
   from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the
   five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after
   assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually
   double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to
   the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience
   model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to
   investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social
   media.
   Results: Among social media users, 36.4\% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3\%
   (738/1440) in London, 67.3\% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8\% (726/1040)
   in Mumbai, and 76.8\% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they
   intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of
   getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack
   of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts,
   and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao
   Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply,
   whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about
   vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of
   vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and
   attracted more public engagement online.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and
   negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent
   to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence
   and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Online misinformation has reached unprecedented levels
   during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study
   analyzed the magnitude and sentiment dynamics of misinformation and
   unverified information about public health interventions during a
   COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang, Vietnam, between July and September 2020.
   Methods: We analyzed user-generated online information about five public
   health interventions during the Da Nang outbreak. We compared the
   volume, source, sentiment polarity, and engagements of online posts
   before, during, and after the outbreak using negative binomial and
   logistic regression, and assessed the content validity of the 500 most
   influential posts. Results: Most of the 54,528 online posts included
   were generated during the outbreak (n = 46,035; 84.42\%) and by online
   newspapers (n = 32,034; 58.75\%). Among the 500 most influential posts,
   316 (63.20\%) contained genuine information, 10 (2.00\%) contained
   misinformation, 152 (30.40\%) were non-factual opinions, and 22 (4.40\%)
   contained unverifiable information. All misinformation posts were made
   during the outbreak, mostly on social media, and were predominantly
   negative. Higher levels of engagement were observed for information that
   was unverifiable (incidence relative risk {[}IRR] = 2.83; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.33-0.62), posted during the outbreak
   (before: IRR = 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.07-0.35; after: IRR = 0.46; 95\% CI,
   0.34-0.63), and with negative sentiment (IRR = 1.84; 95\% CI,
   1.23-2.75). Negatively toned posts were more likely to be misinformation
   (odds ratio {[}OR] = 9.59; 95\% CI, 1.20-76.70) or unverified (OR =
   5.03; 95\% CI, 1.66-15.24). Conclusions: Misinformation and unverified
   information during the outbreak showed clustering, with social media
   being particularly affected. This indepth assessment demonstrates the
   value of analyzing online ``infodemics{''} to inform public health
   responses.},

Title = {Patienthood and participation in the digital era},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The `digital era' of informatics and knowledge integration has changed
   the roles and experiences of patients, research participants and health
   consumers. No longer figured (merely) as passive recipients of
   healthcare services or as beneficiaries of top-down biomedical
   information, individuals are increasingly seen as active contributors in
   healthcare and research. They are positioned into multiple roles that
   are experienced simultaneously by those who access and co-produce
   digital content that can easily be transformed into data. This is
   contextualised by `big data' technologies that have altered biomedicine,
   enabling collation and analysis of myriad data from digitised records to
   personal mobile data. Social media facilitate new formations of
   communities and knowledge enacted online, while novel kinds of
   commercial value emerge from digital networks that enable health data
   commodification. In this paper, we draw from exemplary digital era
   shifts towards participatory medicine to cast light on the
   rapprochements between patienthood, participation and consumption, and
   we explore how these rapprochements are mediated by, and materialise
   through, the use of participatory digital technologies and big data. We
   argue that there is a need to use new conceptual tools that account for
   the multiple roles and experiences of patient-participant-consumers that
   co-emerge through digital technologies. We must also ethically re-assess
   the rights and responsibilities of individuals in the digital era, and
   the implications of digital era changes for the future of biomedicine
   and healthcare.},

Title = {The 10 top-cited authors who published papers in journal medicine since
   2000 using the betweenness centrality to identify unique names:
   Bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Number = {25},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have explored the most productive and
   influential authors in a specific field. However, 2 challenges arise
   when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical
   names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may
   vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address
   these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was
   to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness
   centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited
   authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes.
   Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between
   2000 and 2020 using the keyword ``Medicine {[}Journal].{''} Author
   names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were
   collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index
   was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names
   affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC
   method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major
   clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index
   within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH
   terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their
   research themes.
   Results: Our findings revealed the following: within the top 10 cited
   authors, 2 authors from China shared identical names with Jing Li and
   Tao-Wang; JA Winkelstein from Maryland (US) had the highest x-index
   (15.58); Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan was the most prolific author, having
   published 115 articles in Medicine since 2003; and the 3 primary
   research themes, namely, complications, etiology, and epidemiology, were
   identified using MeSH terms from the 10 most frequently cited authors.
   Conclusions: Using AWS and BC, we identified the top 10 most cited
   authors. The research methods we utilized in this study (BC and AWS)
   have the potential to be applied to other bibliometric analyses in the
   future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BURN CARE \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-7},
Month = {2024 JAN 5},
Abstract = {Social media platforms can serve as a readily accessible tool for burn
   education, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of burn
   injuries. Previous studies have investigated the quality of online burn
   education videos on platforms such as YouTube. Here, we review the
   quality of such videos on TikTok, a newer and rapidly growing platform.
   TikTok was searched for English videos using 29 keywords (hashtags) such
   as \#burn, \#education, \#prevention, and \#management. The first 30
   videos per hashtag were screened. Videos were categorized by content and
   creator. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the included
   videos using the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Metrics such as views,
   commentary, and likes were also examined. Of 535 screened videos, 72 met
   inclusion criteria. 47\% (n = 34) were on management, 33\% (n = 31)
   education, and 10\% (n = 7) prevention. Only 6\% (n = 4) cited sources.
   The median GQS score was 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0). 50\% (n = 36) were
   made by healthcare professionals with a median GQS score of 3.0 (IQR:
   2.0-3.0, max 4.0) compared to 2.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0) in
   nonhealthcare professionals (n = 36). Viewership varied from 41 to 4.2
   million views. Overall, there is a lack of high-quality educational
   information on TikTok. This rapidly expanding and dynamic platform may
   provide an opportunity to direct individuals to higher quality
   resources.},

Title = {Role of the Built and Online Social Environments on Expression of Dining
   on Instagram},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Online social communities are becoming windows for learning more about
   the health of populations, through information about our health-related
   behaviors and outcomes from daily life. At the same time, just as public
   health data and theory has shown that aspects of the built environment
   can affect our health-related behaviors and outcomes, it is also
   possible that online social environments (e.g., posts and other
   attributes of our online social networks) can also shape facets of our
   life. Given the important role of the online environment in public
   health research and implications, factors which contribute to the
   generation of such data must be well understood. Here we study the role
   of the built and online social environments in the expression of dining
   on Instagram in Abu Dhabi; a ubiquitous social media platform, city with
   a vibrant dining culture, and a topic (food posts) which has been
   studied in relation to public health outcomes. Our study uses available
   data on user Instagram profiles and their Instagram networks, as well as
   the local food environment measured through the dining types (e.g.,
   casual dining restaurants, food court restaurants, lounges etc.) by
   neighborhood. We find evidence that factors of the online social
   environment (profiles that post about dining versus profiles that do not
   post about dining) have different influences on the relationship between
   a user's built environment and the social dining expression, with
   effects also varying by dining types in the environment and time of day.
   We examine the mechanism of the relationships via moderation and
   mediation analyses. Overall, this study provides evidence that the
   interplay of online and built environments depend on attributes of said
   environments and can also vary by time of day. We discuss implications
   of this synergy for precisely-targeting public health interventions, as
   well as on using online data for public health research.},

Month = {2021 MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to characterize the representation of public
   health information related to COVID-19 posted on Instagram in 2020.
   Methods: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in Iran
   as one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of
   COVID-19. Data were collected from the contents published from February
   19 to April 3, 2020, on Instagram. The search feature of the Instagram
   app was used to find the posts related to Coronavirus or COVID-19.
   Overall, 1612 posts from 92 accounts were retrieved and analyzed using
   thematic analysis.
   Results: A total of 23 themes emerged from the analysis of the retrieved
   posts. These themes include epidemiology and statistics, training and
   caring, general prevention guidelines, hygiene, healthy diet and
   lifestyle, patients, diagnosis and treatment, personal protective
   equipment, traditional medicine, psychol-ogy, children, cultural
   aspects, socio-cultural impacts, religious, misinformation, and wrong
   behaviors, an-imals, satire, condition of the healthcare system,
   politics, quarantine, operations of the Iranian National Disaster
   Management Organization (NDMO), economic impacts, and world news.
   Conclusion: The contents analysis of Instagram posts during a public
   health crisis can provide new and realistic insights into the crisis and

Title = {Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping
   transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding
   an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for
   identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen
   dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can
   spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity.
   Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less
   commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly
   consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The
   objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement
   versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an
   economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the
   U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such
   data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and
   elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we
   construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the
   networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been
   recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We
   evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and
   evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying
   network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case
   occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via
   network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local
   area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways,
   though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of
   case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x
   higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network
   k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random
   expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p <
   0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on
   proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance
   than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of
   local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall
   levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement
   network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread
   transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network
   analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of
   between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of
   transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and
   highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon
   heterogeneities in network connectivity.},

Abstract = {Chronic diseases and associated conditions are the leading causes of
   death in most of the countries worldwide. Due to this, governments all
   over the world are concerned about the burden of chronic diseases. These
   diseases often pose severe health risks to the patients when they suffer
   from more than one chronic disease at the same time (also named as
   comorbidity of chronic disease). Several prediction approaches utilizing
   routinely collected administrative healthcare data have been developed
   for the prevention and better management of comorbidity. Most studies to
   date have focused on understanding the progression of single chronic
   disease rather than multiple chronic diseases. In this study, a research
   framework is proposed using social network analysis and graph theory
   using administrative healthcare data to understand the comorbidity of
   two chronic diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) leading to the
   development of cardiovascular disease). The results show that diseases
   related to blood (e.g., high blood pressure or high cholesterol) and
   kidney disease occurred frequently during the progression of
   cardiovascular disease for the T2D patients. The proposed framework
   could be useful for stakeholders including governments and health
   insurers to adopt appropriate prevention or management program for the
   patients at high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.},

Title = {The Feasibility and Utility of Harnessing Digital Health to Understand
   Clinical Trajectories in Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder:
   D-TECT Study Design and Methodological Considerations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Introduction: Across the U.S., the prevalence of opioid use disorder
   (OUD) and the rates of opioid overdoses have risen precipitously in
   recent years. Several effective medications for OUD (MOUD) exist and
   have been shown to be life-saving. A large volume of research has
   identified a confluence of factors that predict attrition and continued
   substance use during substance use disorder treatment. However, much of
   this literature has examined a small set of potential moderators or
   mediators of outcomes in MOUD treatment and may lead to over-simplified
   accounts of treatment non-adherence. Digital health methodologies offer
   great promise for capturing intensive, longitudinal ecologically-valid
   data from individuals in MOUD treatment to extend our understanding of
   factors that impact treatment engagement and outcomes. Methods: This
   paper describes the protocol (including the study design and
   methodological considerations) from a novel study supported by the
   National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network at the National
   Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This study (D-TECT) primarily seeks to
   evaluate the feasibility of collecting ecological momentary assessment
   (EMA), smartphone and smartwatch sensor data, and social media data
   among patients in outpatient MOUD treatment. It secondarily seeks to
   examine the utility of EMA, digital sensing, and social media data
   (separately and compared to one another) in predicting MOUD treatment
   retention, opioid use events, and medication adherence {[}as captured in
   electronic health records (EHR) and EMA data]. To our knowledge, this is
   the first project to include all three sources of digitally derived data
   (EMA, digital sensing, and social media) in understanding the clinical
   trajectories of patients in MOUD treatment. These multiple data streams
   will allow us to understand the relative and combined utility of
   collecting digital data from these diverse data sources. The inclusion
   of EHR data allows us to focus on the utility of digital health data in
   predicting objectively measured clinical outcomes. Discussion: Results
   may be useful in elucidating novel relations between digital data
   sources and OUD treatment outcomes. It may also inform approaches to
   enhancing outcomes measurement in clinical trials by allowing for the
   assessment of dynamic interactions between individuals' daily lives and
   their MOUD treatment response.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook
   and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the
   United States: Observational Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a
   vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity,
   widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates
   significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial
   that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments
   toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other
   targeted policy interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial
   intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media
   in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to
   better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19
   vaccines.
   Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines
   were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom
   and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the
   United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to
   November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep
   learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment
   trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed
   longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected
   posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and
   validated insights from the analysis.
   Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments
   were at 58\%, 22\%, and 17\% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56\%,
   24\%, and 18\% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over
   vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over
   their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were
   identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in
   both countries and found them to correlate broadly.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis
   should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments
   alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public
   attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of
   public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the
   concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies
   and communication strategies to maximize uptake.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased worldwide.
   Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is
   associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality
   of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of
   comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and
   better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used
   in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health
   conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the
   progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This
   study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the
   Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity
   progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in
   Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and
   represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph
   theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e.,
   patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were
   selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian
   health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed
   from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two
   baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a
   normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte
   disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients
   with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that
   these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD
   in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially
   help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the
   progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the
   framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and
   private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health
   management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple
   chronic diseases.},

Abstract = {Background In this article, we address questions regarding how people
   consider what they do or do not consent to and the reasons why. This
   article presents the findings of a citizen forum study conducted by the
   University of Geneva in partnership with the Geneva University Hospitals
   to explore the opinions and concerns of members of the public regarding
   predictive oncology, genetic sequencing, and cancer. Methods This paper
   presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A
   research tool titled ``the mechanics of consent{''} was designed for
   this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on
   social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control
   while sharing different types of data with different actors.
   Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were
   audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of
   consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative
   results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate
   their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from
   the discussion amongst participants. Discussion Choice and control of
   personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how
   to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research
   participants shall include information about potential risks and
   benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as
   assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers
   ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent,
   reliable, and honest manner. Governance systems ought to be better
   equipped to address ethical issues raise by the growing presence of
   non-traditional research actors, consent of exchanges of data via
   digital devices and online activity such as social media and fairness of
   data trading. Finally, informed consent is one of the various elements
   that contribute to conducting ethical research. More needs to be done to
   strengthen governance and ensure adequate protection of research
   participants, particularly to address issues related to predictive
   health analytics.},

Title = {A Transdisciplinary Analysis of COVID-19 in Italy: The Most Affected
   Country in Europe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As of 27 March 2020, 199 countries and territories and one international
   conveyance are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the same date,
   Italy represents the third country worldwide in total number of cases
   and the first one in total number of deaths. The purpose of this study
   is to analyse the Italian case and identify key problem questions and
   lessons learned from the Italian experience. The study initially
   provides a general overview of the country's characteristics and health
   care system, followed by a detailed description of the Italian
   epidemiological picture regarding COVID-19. Afterwards, all
   non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by the Government against COVID-19
   are presented in chronological order. The study explores some
   estimations of the economic impact of the epidemic, as well as its
   implications for society, lifestyle, and social media reactions.
   Finally, the study refers to two types of mathematical models to predict
   the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 disease. Having considered all
   of the above-mentioned aspects, some significant issues can be raised,
   including the following: (1) the available epidemiological data presents
   some gaps and potential biases; (2) mathematical models always come with
   high levels of uncertainty; (3) the high number of deaths should be
   interpreted in light of the national demographic context; and (4) the
   long-term management of the epidemic remains an open question. In
   conclusion, the Italian experience definitely highlights the importance
   of preparedness and early action, effective interventions and risk
   communication.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Substance abuse constitutes one of the major contemporary
   health epidemics. Recently, the use of social media platforms has
   garnered interest as a novel source of data for drug addiction
   epidemiology. Often however, the language used in such forums comprises
   slang and jargon. Currently, there are no publicly available resources
   to automatically analyze the esoteric language-use in the social media
   drug-use sub-culture. This lacunae introduces critical challenges for
   interpreting, sensemaking and modeling of addiction epidemiology using
   social media.
   Results: Drug-Use Insights (DUI) is a public and open-source web
   application to address the aforementioned deficiency. DUI is underlined
   by a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing 108 different addiction related
   categories consisting of over 9000 terms, where each category
   encompasses a set of semantically related terms. These categories and
   terms were established by utilizing thematic analysis in conjunction
   with term embeddings generated from 7 472 545 Reddit posts made by 1 402
   017 redditors. Given post(s) from social media forums such as Reddit and
   Twitter, DUI can be used foremost to identify constituent terms related
   to drug use. Furthermore, the DUI categories and integrated
   visualization tools can be leveraged for semantic- and exploratory
   analysis. To the best of our knowledge, DUI utilizes the largest number
   of substance use and recovery social media posts used in a study and
   represents the first significant online taxonomy of drug abuse
   terminology.},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore the prevalence of pediatric (0-72 months old)
   scalds, and to clarify its relationship with household vacuum flasks.
   Methods: A cross sectional online survey based on the largest social
   media in China. Online questionnaire was pushed twice a day to our
   target respondents for successive seven days. We were authorized to
   gain, analyze and publish the information related to this research by
   the Sina \& Weibo data center.
   Results: Prevalence of pediatric scalds was 5.5\%. Gender ratio (boy to
   girl) was 1.96: 1. Toddlers (12-36 months old) were the most susceptible
   age group (54.5\%). Non-intentional water spill was the main causation
   (77.3\%). An extremely low percent (7.1\%) of the parents performed
   first-aid as described by the ``RRICH{''} rule: water rinse-clothes
   remove-water immersion-clean cover-hospital. Scars developed in 52.7\%
   patients and 14.7\% of them underwent reconstructive surgery. There were
   75.5\% Chinese families using vacuum flasks in daily life, but only
   6.1\% families used the fastening device to avoid burns.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of pediatric scalds (0-72 months old) was rather
   high, which might be related to the extensive insecure usage of
   household vacuum flasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights

Month = {2021 APR 3},
Abstract = {Purpose: Rates of organic farms and women organic farmers are
   increasing. Yet, this recent surge brings new and uncertain challenges
   for injury epidemiology. Since many in the population are of
   child-bearing age, and child agricultural injury is a significant
   threat, of particular relevance are the knowledge, attitudes, and
   beliefs towards risk of child injury. Methods: A paper,
   self-administered 11-question questionnaire was distributed at four
   events geared towards early career women organic farmers. The
   questionnaire generated data around select demographics, attitudes
   towards farm safety, and sources of safety knowledge. Findings \&
   Discussion: The questionnaire had a 45\% response rate. As expected,
   most respondents were new to farming (1-3 years' experience as a primary
   owner/operator), and 47\% reported having a child under the age of 18
   years work on the farm. While respondents recognized farms were
   generally unsafe for children, they reported their own farm as safe for
   children. Preferred sources of safety knowledge were those with
   user-generated content from other farmers. Conclusion: Interventions
   with new women organic farmers in the Midwest are likely to be most
   effective by incorporating social media, networking with area farmers'
   groups, and addressing the optimism bias. Information not explicitly
   marketed as safety information may gain traction. A more complete
   analysis of risk, incidence, and prevalence of this niche population is
   important.},

Title = {Epidemiology of High Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) injuries in
   Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Background High intensity functional training (HIFT), usually called
   CrossFit, is a physical training that has gained much popularity in the
   past few years. The risk of acute and overuse injuries in HIFT is
   unclear. This study evaluated the incidence of injuries in HIFT,
   characterizing severity, location, and associated risk factors. Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and May 2021.
   HIFT practitioners were recruited through social media and answered an
   online questionnaire on training characteristics and injury history.
   Results A total of 606 subjects (264 male and 342 female) were included.
   The average age of the participants was 29.78 +/- 7.14 years. The mean
   height was 169.60 +/- 8.96 cm, and the mean body mass was 73.69 +/-
   13.11 kg. Overall, participants were involved in HIFT for an average of
   25.36 +/- 20.29 months. A total of 58.6\% of participants took part in 5
   to 6 training sessions per week, 31.7\% practiced 5 to 6 h per week.
   62.7\% of the responders performed other physical activities in
   parallel, 98.2\% performed warm-up before the training, and a formal
   cooldown was accomplished by 29.4\% of participants. 6.8\% of athletes
   followed individual worksheets. 45.9\% of participants participated in
   competition. Conclusions The overall rate of injuries was 3.51/1000 h.
   59.2\% of subjects experienced two or more injuries. The shoulder was
   involved in 21.3\% of cases, lower back in 18.3\%, and the knee in
   13.4\%. No difference was found in injury rate between males and
   females. Experienced athletes were more prone to injury compared to
   those who trained under 12 months. Approximately the half of injuries
   did not cause training interruption. No difference was found in injury
   rate between males and females. The purpose of the participant did not
   impact the injury rate, nor did the practice of warm-up and cooldown,
   the time of weekly training, the league and level of competition.
   Finally, the participation in other sports in parallel did not
   demonstrated association with the injury occurrence.},

Title = {Obtaining contextually relevant geographic data using Facebook
   recruitment in public health studies},
Journal = {HEALTH \& PLACE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {37-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Online participant recruitment for public health research
   studies has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly as
   traditional recruitment strategies have waned in efficiency. The
   emergence of e-epidemiology offers possibilities for reaching
   understudied populations as well as conducting large-scale studies.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey focused on self-reported
   neighborhood characteristics, perceived stress, and feasibility of
   obtaining work/residential addresses via online recruitment in St.
   Louis, Missouri, USA from February 2017 to December 2017. We report the
   process of using Facebook recruitment and demonstrate how this strategy
   can enhance collection of geospatial data to better understand context
   and spatial patterns of disease.
   Results: A total of 425 participants were recruited via Facebook
   advertisements. All participants reported their residential and work ZIP
   codes, though only 64.7\% and 45.6\% provided their complete residential
   and work street addresses, respectively. Those who reported their
   complete residential street addresses were more likely to be female
   (69.8\% vs. 56.1\% of males, chi(2) = 7.89, 1 df, p = 0.005), though no
   differences were observed by race, age, or employment status.
   Discussion: These findings indicate that valuable location data can be
   successfully collected via Facebook recruitment - data that could
   potentially include residential history or prospective follow-up time or
   be combined with other emerging technologies for geographic data in
   order to better understand the context and the effects of place on
   health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Facebook recruitment may be an underutilized resource for
   obtaining accurate geospatial and contextually relevant health data and
   should be considered as a means for finding participants due to the
   cost-effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of this recruitment
   approach.},

Title = {Emergency Physician Twitter Use in the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Potential
   Predictor of Impending Surge: Retrospective Observational Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Background: The early conversations on social media by emergency
   physicians offer a window into the ongoing response to the COVID-19
   pandemic.
   Objective: This retrospective observational study of emergency physician
   Twitter use details how the health care crisis has influenced emergency
   physician discourse online and how this discourse may have use as a
   harbinger of ensuing surge.
   Methods: Followers of the three main emergency physician professional
   organizations were identified using Twitter's application programming
   interface. They and their followers were included in the study if they
   identified explicitly as US-based emergency physicians. Statuses, or
   tweets, were obtained between January 4, 2020, when the new disease was
   first reported, and December 14, 2020, when vaccination first began.
   Original tweets underwent sentiment analysis using the previously
   validated Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool
   as well as topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation unsupervised
   machine learning. Sentiment and topic trends were then correlated with
   daily change in new COVID-19 cases and inpatient bed utilization.
   Results: A total of 3463 emergency physicians produced 334,747 unique
   English-language tweets during the study period. Out of 3463
   participants, 910 (26.3\%) stated that they were in training, and 466 of
   902 (51.7\%) participants who provided their gender identified as men.
   Overall tweet volume went from a pre-March 2020 mean of 481.9 (SD 72.7)
   daily tweets to a mean of 1065.5 (SD 257.3) daily tweets thereafter.
   Parameter and topic number tuning led to 20 tweet topics, with a topic
   coherence of 0.49. Except for a week in June and 4 days in November,
   discourse was dominated by the health care system (45,570/334,747,
   13.6\%). Discussion of pandemic response, epidemiology, and clinical
   care were jointly found to moderately correlate with COVID-19 hospital
   bed utilization (Pearson r=0.41), as was the occurrence of ``covid,{''}
   ``coronavirus,{''} or ``pandemic{''} in tweet texts (r=0.47). Momentum
   in COVID-19 tweets, as demonstrated by a sustained crossing of 7- and
   28-day moving averages, was found to have occurred on an average of 45.0
   (SD 12.7) days before peak COVID-19 hospital bed utilization across the
   country and in the four most contributory states.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 Twitter discussion among emergency physicians
   correlates with and may precede the rising of hospital burden. This
   study, therefore, begins to depict the extent to which the ongoing
   pandemic has affected the field of emergency medicine discourse online
   and suggests a potential avenue for understanding predictors of surge.},

Title = {Methods to madness: The utility of complex systems science in a mad, mad

Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Existing methods in social {[}oral] epidemiology primarily utilize
   statistical models that assume static characteristics of individuals and
   environments. While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the
   social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and
   progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture
   complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments
   respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a
   variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent
   consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social
   Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial
   health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple
   levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new
   and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite
   of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative
   mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral
   health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic
   interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study
   and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients,
   healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any
   differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future
   longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively.
   This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of
   complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex
   systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics
   models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges
   faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods
   into the population oral health sciences.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the globe in previously
   unimaginable ways, with far-reaching economic and social implications.
   It has also led to an outpouring of daily, ever-changing information. To
   assess the amount of data that were emerging, a PubMed search related to
   COVID-19 was performed. Nearly 8000 articles have been published since
   the virus was defined 4 months ago. This number has grown exponentially
   every month, potentially hindering our ability to discern what is
   scientifically important. Unlike previous global pandemics, we exist in
   a world of instantaneous access. Information, accurate or otherwise, is
   flowing from one side of the world to the other via word of mouth,
   social media, news, and medical journals. Changes in practice guidelines
   should be based on high-quality, well-powered research. Our job as
   health care providers is to mitigate misinformation and provide
   reassurance to prevent a second pandemic of misinformation.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe aim of this literature review is to examine evidence of time
   trends and birth cohort effects in depressive disorders and symptoms
   among US adolescents in peer-reviewed articles from January 2004 to
   April 2022.MethodsWe conducted an integrative systematic literature
   review. Three reviewers participated at different stages of article
   review. Of the 2234 articles identified in three databases (Pubmed,
   ProQuest Central, Ebscohost), 10 met inclusion criteria (i.e.,
   adolescent aged United States populations, included information about
   birth cohort and survey year, focused on depressive
   symptoms/disorders).ResultsAll 10 articles observed increases in
   depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescents across recent survey
   years with increases observed between 1991 and 2020. Of the 3 articles
   that assessed birth cohort trends, birth cohort trends were less
   prominent than time period trends. Proposed explanations for increases
   included social media, economic-related reasons, changes in mental
   health screening and diagnosis, declining mental health stigma,
   increased treatment, and, in more recent years, the COVID-19
   pandemic.ConclusionsMultiple cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies
   documented rising prevalence of depressive symptoms and disorder among
   adolescents from 1991 to 2020. Mechanisms driving this increase are
   still unknown. Research to identify these mechanisms is needed to inform
   depression screening and intervention efforts for adolescents.},

Abstract = {Objective To describe cognitive symptoms in people not hospitalised at
   study enrolment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated demographics,
   medical history, other neuropsychiatric symptoms and SARS-CoV-2
   vaccination.
   Design Longitudinal observational study.
   Setting Direct-to-participant registry with community-based recruitment
   via email and social media including Google, Facebook and Reddit,
   targeting adult US residents. Demographics, medical history,
   COVID-19-like symptoms, tests and vaccinations were collected through
   enrolment and follow-up surveys.
   Participants Participants who reported positive COVID-19 test results
   between 15 December 2020 and 13 December 2021. Those with cognitive
   symptoms were compared with those not reporting such symptoms.
   Main outcome measure Self-reported cognitive symptoms (defined as
   `feeling disoriented or having trouble thinking' from listed options or
   related written-in symptoms)
   Results Of 3908 participants with a positive COVID-19 test result, 1014
   (25.9\%) reported cognitive symptoms at any time point during enrolment
   or follow-up, with approximately half reporting moderate/severe
   symptoms. Cognitive symptoms were associated with other neuropsychiatric
   symptoms, including dysgeusia, anosmia, trouble waking up, insomnia,
   headache, anxiety and depression. In multivariate analyses, female sex
   (OR, 95\% CI): 1.7 (1.3 to 2.2), age (40-49 years (OR: 1.5 (1.2-1.9)
   compared with 18-29 years), history of autoimmune disease (OR: 1.5
   (1.2-2.1)), lung disease (OR: 1.7 (1.3-2.2)) and depression (OR: 1.4
   (1.1-1.7)) were associated with cognitive symptoms. Conversely, black
   race (OR: 0.6 (0.5-0.9)) and COVID-19 vaccination before infection (OR:
   0.6 (0.4-0.7)) were associated with reduced occurrence of cognitive
   symptoms.
   Conclusions In this study, cognitive symptoms among COVID-19-positive
   participants were associated with female gender, age, autoimmune
   disorders, lung disease and depression. Vaccination and black race were
   associated with lower occurrence of cognitive symptoms. A constellation
   of neuropsychiatric and psychological symptoms occurred with cognitive
   symptoms. Our findings suggest COVID-19's full health and economic
   burden may be underestimated.},

Abstract = {Background Scant data are available about global patterns of severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread and global
   epidemiology of early confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside mainland
   China. We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics
   of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19
   as a pandemic.
   Methods Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10,
   2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official
   websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media
   feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies.
   Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were
   abstracted. Countries with at least one case were dassified as affected.
   Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported
   from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100
   cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first
   case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and
   exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and
   duster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings.
   Findings Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected
   countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76\%) had recent travel to
   affected countries; 60 (61\%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran.
   Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73\%) were early
   cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51
   years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3\%) of 762 early cases occurred in children
   younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2\%) of 1200 cases were in
   health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were
   identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting
   was households (76 {[}75\%]; mean 2.6 cases per cluster {[}range 2-71),
   followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 {[}14\%]; mean 4.3
   cases per cluster {[}2-141), and community gatherings (11{[}11\%]; mean
   14.2 cases per cluster {[}4-36]).
   Interpretation Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran
   accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases
   from affected countries. Among cases with age information available,
   most were among adults aged 18 years and older. Although there were many
   dusters of household transmission among early cases, clusters in
   occupational or community settings tended to be larger, supporting a
   possible role for physical distancing to slow the progression of
   SARS-CoV-2 spread. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chronic diseases have increasingly become common and caused most of the
   burden of ill health in most countries. They have large impacts on
   quality of life, social and economic conditions. These diseases bring
   several health risks to those patients suffering from more than one
   chronic disease at one time (also known as comorbidity of chronic
   disease). Due to this, governments and healthcare service providers are
   concerned about the burden of comorbidity of chronic diseases.
   Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide vital
   information for the prevention and better management of chronic
   diseases. The routinely collected hospital claim data contain semantic
   information about patients' health in the form of disease codes.
   Therefore, these data can be used to understand the progression of
   chronic disease comorbidities. Most studies in this field are focused on
   understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than
   multiple chronic diseases. In this study, we aim to understand the
   progression of multiple chronic diseases, i.e., comorbidities that occur
   when patients of one chronic condition progress towards another. Based
   on the prevalence of chronic diseases within the Australian population,
   we have particularly focused on the comorbidity progression of
   congestive heart failure (CHF) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. In
   this study, we propose a research framework to understand and represent
   the progression of CHF in patients with T2D using graph theory and
   social network analysis. We used hospital claim data drawn from the
   Australian healthcare context. We constructed two baseline disease
   networks from two cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2D and CHF and
   patients with only T2D). A final weighted disease network from two
   cohorts was then generated by giving more weights to the prevalent
   comorbidities in patients with T2D and CHF compared to the patients with
   only T2D. The results show that chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac
   arrhythmias, valvular disease and renal failure occurred frequently
   during the progression of CHF for T2D patients. In addition, the final
   disease network shows the highest transition between electrolyte
   disorders and renal failure. This indicates that these two diseases may
   be potential risk factors for the progression towards CHF in patients
   with T2D for this population cohort. Thus, the proposed network
   representation can help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk
   diseases and progression pattern between recurrence of T2D and CHF.
   Also, it can help in the efficient management of healthcare resources.
   The proposed framework could be useful for stakeholders including
   governments and health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health
   management program for the patients at high risk of developing multiple
   chronic diseases.},

Abstract = {To study the prevalence of severe social anxiety (SSA) among a group of
   adolescents during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   A total of 178 adolescents attending the private clinics of the authors
   were screened online for the presence of SSA, by using the
   self-reporting format of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for children
   and adolescents (LSAS-CA). SSA defined as LSAS-CA scores of 80 or more
   was checked for statistical association with the adolescents'
   sociodemographic data and knowledge about the COVID-19 infection. The
   18\% of our participants had SSA, no correlation was found between
   having SSA and a acknowledging or fearing the COVID-19 morbidity.
   Factors associated with SSA included texting, using social media, and
   playing video games during the lockdown. Mitigating factors include high
   family socioeconomic status, history of socialization with friends, and
   the use of WhatsApp as a source of information about COVID-19 infection.},

Title = {Investigating Individuals' Perceptions Regarding the Context Around the
   Low Back Pain Experience: Topic Modeling Analysis of Twitter Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Background: Low back pain (LBP) remains the leading cause of disability
   worldwide. A better understanding of the beliefs regarding LBP and
   impact of LBP on the individual is important in order to improve
   outcomes. Although personal experiences of LBP have traditionally been
   explored through qualitative studies, social media allows access to data
   from a large, heterogonous, and geographically distributed population,
   which is not possible using traditional qualitative or quantitative
   methods. As data on social media sites are collected in an unsolicited
   manner, individuals are more likely to express their views and emotions
   freely and in an unconstrained manner as compared to traditional data
   collection methods. Thus, content analysis of social media provides a
   novel approach to understanding how problems such as LBP are perceived
   by those who experience it and its impact.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to identify contextual
   variables of the LBP experience from a first-person perspective to
   provide insights into individuals' beliefs and perceptions.
   Methods: We analyzed 896,867 cleaned tweets about LBP between January 1,
   2014, and December 31, 2018. We tested and compared latent Dirichlet
   allocation (LDA), Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM), GPU-DMM, biterm
   topic model, and nonnegative matrix factorization for identifying topics
   associated with tweets. A coherence score was determined to identify the
   best model. Two domain experts independently performed qualitative
   content analysis of the topics with the strongest coherence score and
   grouped them into contextual categories. The experts met and reconciled
   any differences and developed the final labels.
   Results: LDA outperformed all other algorithms, resulting in the highest
   coherence score. The best model was LDA with 60 topics, with a coherence
   score of 0.562. The 60 topics were grouped into 19 contextual
   categories. ``Emotion and beliefs{''} had the largest proportion of
   total tweets (157,563/896,867, 17.6\%), followed by ``physical
   activity{''} (124,251/896,867, 13.85\%) and ``daily life{''}
   (80,730/896,867, 9\%), while ``food and drink,{''} ``weather,{''} and
   ``not being understood{''} had the smallest proportions (11,551/896,867,
   1.29\%; 10,109/896,867, 1.13\%; and 9180/896,867, 1.02\%, respectively).
   Of the 11 topics within ``emotion and beliefs,{''} 113,562/157,563
   (72\%) had negative sentiment.
   Conclusions: The content analysis of tweets in the area of LBP
   identified common themes that are consistent with findings from
   conventional qualitative studies but provide a more granular view of
   individuals' perspectives related to LBP. This understanding has the
   potential to assist with developing more effective and personalized
   models of care to improve outcomes in those with LBP.},

   Brazil: a qualitative study protocol},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious,
   with the recent World Health Organization decree confirming a global
   public health emergency. The outcomes related to maternal and fetal
   health among pregnant women infected with the virus are still poorly
   understood. The world population has been waiting for answers and
   remains constantly alert about the pandemic's progress. It is not yet
   known what impact this pandemic experience will have on the population's
   mental health, especially pregnant women.
   Method: We aim to understand and discuss the experiences of women who
   were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, in relation to the illness
   process, community relations, and social media influences. This is a
   qualitative study in which we will interview women who were infected by
   COVID-19 during pregnancy and received medical care from a tertiary
   university hospital specializing in women's health in Brazil. We will
   use the techniques of Semi-Directed Interviews of Open and In-depth
   Questions, socio-demographic and health data sheets, and Field Diaries.
   We will use purposive sampling and the criterion of theoretical
   saturation for its construction. The interviews will be conducted by
   phone or video call, with audio recorded for later transcription. The
   treatment of the data will be completed through Thematic Analysis and
   discussed in light of the Health Psychology framework, with the
   production of categories that answer the proposed research questions.
   Discussion: It is expected that the results contribute to the
   understanding about the demands that come to the health professional of
   women infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy in a pandemic situation.},

Abstract = {Introduction Little research has been done to systematically evaluate
   concerns of people living with diabetes through social media, which has
   been a powerful tool for social change and to better understand
   perceptions around health-related issues. This study aims to identify
   key diabetes-related concerns in the USA and primary emotions associated
   with those concerns using information shared on Twitter.
   Research design and methods A total of 11.7 million diabetes-related
   tweets in English were collected between April 2017 and July 2019.
   Machine learning methods were used to filter tweets with personal
   content, to geolocate (to the USA) and to identify clusters of tweets
   with emotional elements. A sentiment analysis was then applied to each
   cluster.
   Results We identified 46 407 tweets with emotional elements in the USA
   from which 30 clusters were identified; 5 clusters (18\% of tweets) were
   related to insulin pricing with both positive emotions (joy, love)
   referring to advocacy for affordable insulin andsadnessemotions related
   to the frustration of insulin prices, 5 clusters (12\% of tweets) to
   solidarity and support with a majority ofjoyandloveemotions expressed.
   The most negative topics (10\% of tweets) were related to diabetes
   distress (24\%sadness,27\%anger, 21\%fearelements), to diabetic and
   insulin shock (45\%anger, 46\%fear) and comorbidities (40\%sadness).
   Conclusions Using social media data, we have been able to describe key
   diabetes-related concerns and their associated emotions. More
   specifically, we were able to highlight the real-world concerns of

Title = {Hepatitis C virus media coverage favorably impacts on antibody testing

Abstract = {Background In the non-interferon era, many patients still remain
   untested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our aim was to determine
   if media coverage, number and type of news, can influence the rate of
   HCV testing.
   Methods For each calendar year we searched from national, regional and
   local newspapers for articles published related to HCV between 2001 and
   2013 (interferon era) and 2014-2018 (non-interferon era) and the HCV
   tests performed. Demographics, provider data and test result were
   collected from patients tested.
   Results During the studied period, 21 913 press articles were found, and
   we identified a total of 293 226 HCV tests. A total of 9778 HCV tests
   from 5237 patients tested positive (1.88\%). An inverse correlation was
   found between media coverage and the number of HCV tests during the
   interferon era (r(2) = -0.558, P = 0.024), where news concerning
   epidemiology and burden of the disease were more frequent. By contrast,
   in the non-interferon era a strong correlation was observed (r(2) =
   0.900, P = 0.019), where news related to treatment prevailed.
   Conclusion Our results show that media coverage on HCV fluctuate so the
   type of news. It remains to be prospectively evaluated if well designed
   publicity campaigns about the benefits of HCV screening and treatment
   influences on HCV testing.},

Title = {Kitesurf injury trauma evaluation study: A prospective cohort study

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Kitesurfing is an increasingly popular and potentially dangerous extreme
   water sport. We hypothesized that kitesurfing has a higher injury rate
   than other (contact) sports and that the minority of injuries are
   severe.
   AIM
   To investigate the incidence and epidemiology of kitesurfing injuries in
   a Dutch cohort during a complete kitesurfing season.
   METHODS
   Injury data of 194 kitesurfers of various skill levels, riding styles
   and age were surveyed prospectively during a full kitesurf season. The
   participants were recruited through the Dutch national kitesurf
   association, social media, local websites and kitesurf schools.
   Participants completed digital questionnaires monthly. The amount of
   time kitesurfing was registered along with all sustained injuries. If an
   injury was reported, an additional questionnaire explored the type of
   injury, injury location, severity and the circumstances under which the
   injury occurred.
   RESULTS
   The mean age of participants was 31 years (range, 13-59) and the
   majority of the study population was male (74.2\%). A total of 177
   injuries were sustained during 16816 kitesurf hours. The calculated
   injury rate was 10.5 injuries per 1000 h of kitesurfing. The most common
   injuries were cuts and abrasions (25.4\%), followed by contusions
   (19.8\%), joint sprains (17.5\%) and muscle sprains (10.2\%). The foot
   and ankle were the most common site of injury (31.8\%), followed by the
   knee (14.1\%) and hand and wrist (10.2\%). Most injuries were reported
   to occur during a trick or jump. Although the majority of injuries were
   mild, severe injuries like an anterior cruciate ligament tear, a lumbar
   spine fracture, a bimalleolar ankle fracture and an eardrum rupture were
   reported.
   CONCLUSION
   The injury rate of kitesurfing is in the range of other popular
   (contact) sports. Most injuries are relatively mild, although
   kitesurfing has the potential to cause serious injuries.},

Title = {Study protocol: building an evidence base for epidemiology emergency
   response, a mixed-methods study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Introduction Determinants and drivers for emergencies, such as political
   instability, weak health systems, climate change and forcibly displaced
   populations, are increasing the severity, complexity and frequency of
   public health emergencies. As emergencies become more complex, it is
   increasingly important that the required skillset of the emergency
   response workforce is clearly defined. To enable essential
   epidemiological activities to be implemented and managed during an
   emergency, a workforce is required with the right mix of skills,
   knowledge, experience and local context awareness. This study aims to
   provide local and international responders with an opportunity to
   actively contribute to the development of new thinking around emergency
   response roles and required competencies. In this study, we will develop
   recommendations using a broad range of evidence to address identified
   lessons and challenges so that future major emergency responses are
   culturally and contextually appropriate, and less reliant on long-term
   international deployments.
   Method and analysis We will conduct a mixed-methods study using an
   exploratory sequential study design. The integration of four data
   sources, including key informant interviews, a scoping literature
   review, survey and semistructured interviews will allow the research
   questions to be examined in a flexible, semistructured way, from a range
   of perspectives. The study is unequally weighted, with a qualitative
   emphasis. We will analyse all activities as individual components, and
   then together in an integrated analysis. Thematic analysis will be
   conducted in NVivo V.11 and quantitative analysis will be conducted in
   Stata V.15.
   Ethics and dissemination All activities have been approved by the
   Science and Medical Delegated Ethics Review Committee at the Australian
   National University (protocol numbers 2018-521, 2018-641, 2019-068).
   Findings will be disseminated through international and local deployment
   partners, peer--reviewed publication, presentation at international
   conferences and through social media such as Twitter and Facebook.},

Title = {Post-treatment surveillance testing of patients with colorectal cancer
   and the association with survival: protocol for a retrospective cohort

   database},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Introduction Although the colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rate has
   significantly improved over the past several decades, many patients will
   have a recurrence following curative treatment. Despite this high risk
   of recurrence, adherence to CRC surveillance testing guidelines is poor
   which increases cancer-related morbidity and potentially, mortality.
   Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with varying surveillance
   strategies have yielded conflicting evidence regarding the survival
   benefit associated with surveillance testing. However, due to
   differences in study protocols and limitations of sample size and length
   of follow-up, the RCT may not be the best study design to evaluate this
   relationship. An observational comparative effectiveness research study
   can overcome the sample size/follow-up limitations of RCT designs while
   assessing realworld variability in receipt of surveillance testing to
   provide much needed evidence on this important clinical issue. The gap
   in knowledge that this study will address concerns whether adherence to
   National Comprehensive Cancer Network CRC surveillance guidelines
   improves survival.
   Methods and analysis Patients with colon and rectal cancer aged 66-84
   years, who have been diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 and have been
   included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare
   database, are eligible for this retrospective cohort study. To minimise
   bias, patients had to survive at least 12 months following the
   completion of treatment. Adherence to surveillance testing up to 5 years
   post-treatment will be assessed in each year of follow-up and overall.
   Binomial regression will be used to assess the association between
   patients' characteristics and adherence. Survival analysis will be
   conducted to assess the association between adherence and 5-year
   survival.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the National Cancer
   Institute and the Institutional Review Board of the University of
   Central Florida. The results of this study will be disseminated by
   publishing in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, presentation at
   national/international scientific conferences and posting through social

Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Google searches create a window into population-wide thoughts and plans
   not just of individuals, but populations at large. Since the outbreak of
   COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to contain
   it, searches for socially distanced activities have trended. We
   hypothesize that trends in the volume of search queries related to
   activities associated with COVID-19 transmission correlate with
   subsequent COVID-19 caseloads. We present a preliminary analytics
   framework that examines the relationship between Google search queries
   and the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States.
   We designed an experimental tool with search volume indices to track
   interest in queries related to two themes: isolation and mobility. Our
   goal was to capture the underlying social dynamics of an unprecedented
   pandemic using alternative data sources that are new to epidemiology.
   Our results indicate that the net movement index we defined correlates
   with COVID-19 weekly new case growth rate with a lag of between 10 and
   14 days for the United States at-large, as well as at the state level
   for 42 out of 50 states with the exception of 8 states (DE, IA, KS, NE,
   ND, SD, WV, WY) from March to June 2020. In addition, an increasing
   caseload was seen over the summer in some southern US states. A sharp
   rise in mobility indices was followed by a sharp increase, respectively,
   in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona,
   California, Florida, and Texas. A sharp decline in mobility indices is
   often followed by a sharp decline, respectively, in the case growth
   data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, Texas,
   and New York. The digital epidemiology framework presented here aims to
   discover predictors of the pandemic's curve, which could supplement
   traditional predictive models and inform early warning systems and
   public health policies.},

   to online instruction and now face the question of whether and how to
   resume in-person instruction. This article uses transcript data from a
   medium-sized American university to describe three enrollment networks
   that connect students through classes and in the process create social
   conditions for the spread of infectious disease: a university-wide
   network, an undergraduate-only network, and a liberal arts college
   network. All three networks are ``small worlds{''} characterized by high
   clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths
   connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together,
   but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major
   integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or
   more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses
   are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed
   before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and
   less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students
   are connected through multiple independent paths. Hybrid models of
   instruction can reduce but not eliminate the potential for epidemic
   spread through the small worlds of course enrollments.},

Title = {Mechanisms accounting for gendered differences in mental health status
   among young Canadians: A novel quantitative analysis},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {169},
Month = {2023 APR},
Abstract = {Adolescent girls consistently report worse mental health than boys. This
   study used reports from a 2018 national health promotion survey (n =
   11,373) to quantitatively explore why such gender-based differences
   exist among young Canadians.Using mediation analyses and contemporary
   social theory, we explored mechanisms that may explain dif-ferences in
   mental health between adolescents who identify as boys versus girls. The
   potential mediators tested were social supports within family and
   friends, engagement in addictive social media use, and overt
   risk-taking. Analyses were performed with the full sample and in
   specific high-risk groups, such as adolescents who report lower family
   affluence. Higher levels of addictive social media use and lower
   perceived levels of family support among girls mediated a significant
   proportion of the difference between boys and girls for each of the
   three mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, frequent health
   complaints, and diagnosis of mental illness). Observed mediation effects
   were similar in high-risk subgroups; however, among those with low
   affluence, effects of family support were somewhat more pronounced.Study
   findings point to deeper, root causes of gender-based mental health
   inequalities that emerge during childhood. Interventions designed to
   reduce girls' addictive social media use or increase their perceived
   family support, to be more in line with their male peers, could help to
   reduce differences in mental health between boys and girls. Contemporary
   focus on social media use and social supports among girls, especially
   those with low affluence, warrant study as the basis for public health
   and clinical interventions.},

Title = {Using Twitter to Detect Psychological Characteristics of Self-Identified
   Persons With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: More than 3.5 million Americans live with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Major challenges persist in diagnosing ASD as no medical
   test exists to diagnose this disorder. Digital phenotyping holds promise
   to guide in the clinical diagnoses and screening of ASD.
   Objective: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using the
   Web-based social media platform Twitter to detect psychological and
   behavioral characteristics of self-identified persons with ASD.
   Methods: Data from Twitter were retrieved from 152 self-identified users
   with ASD and 182 randomly selected control users from March 22, 2012 to
   July 20, 2017. We conducted a between-group comparative textual analysis
   of tweets about repetitive and obsessive-compulsive behavioral
   characteristics typically associated with ASD. In addition, common
   emotional characteristics of persons with ASD, such as fear, paranoia,
   and anxiety, were examined between groups through textual analysis.
   Furthermore, we compared the timing of tweets between users with ASD and
   control users to identify patterns in communication.
   Results: Users with ASD posted a significantly higher frequency of
   tweets related to the specific repetitive behavior of counting compared
   with control users (P<. 001). The textual analysis of
   obsessive-compulsive behavioral characteristics, such as fixate,
   excessive, and concern, were significantly higher among users with ASD
   compared with the control group (P<. 001). In addition, emotional terms
   related to fear, paranoia, and anxiety were tweeted at a significantly
   higher rate among users with ASD compared with control users (P<.001).
   Users with ASD posted a smaller proportion of tweets during time
   intervals of 00: 00-05: 59 (P<.001), 06: 00-11: 59 (P<.001), and 18:
   00-23.59 (P<. 001), as well as a greater proportion of tweets from 12:
   00 to 17: 59 (P<. 001) compared with control users.
   Conclusions: Social media may be a valuable resource for observing
   unique psychological characteristics of self-identified persons with
   ASD. Collecting and analyzing data from these digital platforms may
   afford opportunities to identify the characteristics of ASD and assist
   in the diagnosis or verification of ASD. This study highlights the
   feasibility of leveraging digital data for gaining new insights into
   various health conditions.},

Title = {Using Search Engine Data as a Tool to Predict Syphilis},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {574-578},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Researchers have suggested that social media and online
   search data might be used to monitor and predict syphilis and other
   sexually transmitted diseases. Because people at risk for syphilis might
   seek sexual health and risk-related information on the internet, we
   investigated associations between internet state-level search query data
   (e.g., Google Trends) and reported weekly syphilis cases.
   Methods: We obtained weekly counts of reported primary and secondary
   syphilis for 50 states from 2012 to 2014 from the US Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention. We collected weekly internet search query data
   regarding 25 risk-related keywords from 2012 to 2014 for 50 states using
   Google Trends. We joined 155 weeks of Google Trends data with 1-week lag
   to weekly syphilis data for a total of 7750 data points. Using the least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we trained three linear mixed
   models on the first 10 weeks of each year. We validated models for 2012
   and 2014 for the following 52 weeks and the 2014 model for the following
   42 weeks.
   Results: The models, consisting of different sets of keyword predictors
   for each year, accurately predicted 144 weeks of primary and secondary
   syphilis counts for each state, with an overall average R-2 of 0.9 and
   overall average root mean squared error of 4.9.
   Conclusions: We used Google Trends search data from the prior week to
   predict cases of syphilis in the following weeks for each state. Further
   research could explore how search data could be integrated into public
   health monitoring systems.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust the field of
   public health into the spotlight. For many epidemiologists,
   biostatisticians, and other public health professionals, this caused the
   professional aspects of our lives to collide with the personal, as
   friends and family reached out with concerns and questions. Learning how
   to navigate this space was new for many of us and required refining our
   communication style depending on context, setting, and audience. Some of
   us took to social media, utilizing our existing personal accounts to
   share information after sorting through and summarizing the rapidly
   emerging literature to keep loved ones safe. However, those in our lives
   sometimes asked unanswerable questions, or began distancing themselves
   when we suggested more stringent guidance than they had hoped for,
   causing additional stress during an already traumatic time. We often had
   to remind ourselves that we were also individuals experiencing this
   pandemic and that our time-intensive efforts were meaningful, relevant,
   and impactful. As this pandemic and other public health crises continue,
   we encourage members of our discipline to consider how we can best use
   shared lessons from this period and to recognize that our professional
   knowledge, when used in our personal lives, can promote, protect, and
   bolster confidence in public health.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic produced a very sudden and serious impact on
   public health around the world, greatly adding to the burden of
   overloaded professionals and national medical systems. Recent medical
   research has demonstrated the value of using online systems to predict
   emerging spatial distributions of transmittable diseases. Concerned
   internet users often resort to online sources in an effort to explain
   their medical symptoms. This raises the prospect that incidence of
   COVID-19 may be tracked online by search queries and social media posts
   analyzed by advanced methods in data science, such as Artificial
   Intelligence. Online queries can provide early warning of an impending
   epidemic, which is valuable information needed to support planning
   timely interventions. Identification of the location of clusters
   geographically helps to support containment measures by providing
   information for decision-making and modeling.},

Abstract = {The impact of infectious disease on human populations is a function of
   many factors including environmental conditions, vector dynamics,
   transmission mechanics, social and cultural behaviors, and public
   policy. A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully
   connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from
   reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human
   societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software
   environment and conceptual architecture for data integration,
   situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention
   assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically
   collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing,
   integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources,
   applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing
   disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous
   populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language
   processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for
   information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness.
   Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines,
   random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions.},

Title = {Evaluating the Global Impact of Stroke Awareness Month: A Serial
   Cross-Sectional Analysis},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is the second-leading cause of mortality in the
   world and ranks fifth in terms of causes of death in the United States.
   ``Time is brain{''} when it comes to the detection and treatment of a
   stroke as it can reduce morbidity and disability in the long run. May is
   recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned
   stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the
   risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the
   first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to
   formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke
   awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May
   from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke
   awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR
   \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network
   analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts.
   Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of
   relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact,
   reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags,
   influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage,
   Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke
   awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an
   overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the
   total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the
   tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard
   deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have
   been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top
   users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the
   event had primary involvement from the United States and the United
   Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents,
   especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates
   highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally.
   The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing
   countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement
   on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform
   future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and
   global health.},

   Recent Findings mHealth is being used to measure, predict, and prevent
   the full spectrum of injuries. However, most literature remains
   preliminary or in a pilot stage. Use of best-of-class design principles
   (e.g., user-centered design, theory-based development) is uncommon, and
   wide-scale dissemination of effective monitoring or intervention tools
   is rare. mHealth for injury prevention holds promise, but further work
   is needed across the full spectrum of development and translation.},

Title = {Scanxiety Conversations on Twitter: Observational Study},
Journal = {JMIR CANCER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Scan-associated anxiety (or ``scanxiety{''}) is commonly
   experienced by people having cancer-related scans. Social media
   platforms such as Twitter provide a novel source of data for
   observational research.Objective: We aimed to identify posts on Twitter
   (or ``tweets{''}) related to scanxiety, describe the volume and content
   of these tweets, and describe the demographics of users posting about
   scanxiety.Methods: We manually searched for ``scanxiety{''} and
   associated keywords in cancer-related, publicly available,
   English-language tweets posted between January 2018 and December 2020.
   We defined ``conversations{''} as a primary tweet (the first tweet about
   scanxiety) and subsequent tweets (interactions stemming from the primary
   tweet). User demographics and the volume of primary tweets were
   assessed. Conversations underwent inductive thematic and content
   analysis.Results: A total of 2031 unique Twitter users initiated a
   conversation about scanxiety from cancer-related scans. Most were
   patients (n=1306, 64\%), female (n=1343, 66\%), from North America
   (n=1130, 56\%), and had breast cancer (449/1306, 34\%). There were 3623
   Twitter conversations, with a mean of 101 per month (range 40-180). Five
   themes were identified. The first theme was experiences of scanxiety,
   identified in 60\% (2184/3623) of primary tweets, which captured the
   personal account of scanxiety by patients or their support person.
   Scanxiety was often described with negative adjectives or similes,
   despite being experienced differently by users. Scanxiety had
   psychological, physical, and functional impacts. Contributing factors to
   scanxiety included the presence and duration of uncertainty, which was
   exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second theme (643/3623,
   18\%) was the acknowledgment of scanxiety, where users summarized or
   labeled an experience as scanxiety without providing emotive
   clarification, and advocacy of scanxiety, where users raised awareness
   of scanxiety without describing personal experiences. The third theme
   was messages of support (427/3623, 12\%), where users expressed well
   wishes and encouraged positivity for people experiencing scanxiety. The
   fourth theme was strategies to reduce scanxiety (319/3623, 9\%), which
   included general and specific strategies for patients and strategies
   that required improvements in clinical practice by clinicians or health
   care systems. The final theme was research about scanxiety (50/3623,
   1\%), which included tweets about the epidemiology, impact, and
   contributing factors of scanxiety as well as novel strategies to reduce
   scanxiety.Conclusions: Scanxiety was often a negative experience
   described by patients having cancer-related scans. Social media
   platforms like Twitter enable individuals to share their experiences and
   offer support while providing researchers with unique data to improve
   their understanding of a problem. Acknowledging scanxiety as a term and
   increasing awareness of scanxiety is an important first step in reducing
   scanxiety. Research is needed to guide evidence-based approaches to
   reduce scanxiety, though some low-cost, low-resource practical
   strategies identified in this study could be rapidly introduced into
   clinical care.},

Title = {A time evolving online social network generation algorithm},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of online social media usage in our daily lives has
   increased the importance of analyzing the dynamics of online social
   networks. However, the dynamic data of existing online social media
   platforms are not readily accessible. Hence, there is a necessity to
   synthesize networks emulating those of online social media for further
   study. In this work, we propose an epidemiology-inspired and
   community-based, time-evolving online social network generation
   algorithm (EpiCNet), to generate a time-evolving sequence of random
   networks that closely mirror the characteristics of real-world online
   social networks. Variants of the algorithm can produce both undirected
   and directed networks to accommodate different user interaction
   paradigms. EpiCNet utilizes compartmental models inspired by
   mathematical epidemiology to simulate the flow of individuals into and
   out of the online social network. It also employs an overlapping
   community structure to enable more realistic connections between
   individuals in the network. Furthermore, EpiCNet evolves the community
   structure and connections in the simulated online social network as a
   function of time and with an emphasis on the behavior of individuals.
   EpiCNet is capable of simulating a variety of online social networks by
   adjusting a set of tunable parameters that specify the individual
   behavior and the evolution of communities over time. The experimental
   results show that the network properties of the synthetic time-evolving
   online social network generated by EpiCNet, such as clustering
   coefficient, node degree, and diameter, match those of typical
   real-world online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.},

Abstract = {Tweets mentioning medications are valuable for efforts in digital
   epidemiology to supplement traditional methods of monitoring public
   health. A major obstacle, however, is to differentiate them from the
   large majority of tweets on other topics posted in a user's timeline:
   solving the infamous `needle in a haystack' problem. While deep learning
   models have significantly improved classification, their performance and
   inference processing time remain low on extremely imbalanced corpora
   where the tweets of interest are less than 1\% of all tweets. In this
   study, we empirically evaluate under-sampling, fine-tuning, and
   filtering heuristics to train such classifiers. Using a corpus of 212
   Twitter timelines (181,607 tweets with only 0.2\% tweets mentioning a
   medication), our results show that combining these heuristics is
   necessary to impact the classifier's performance. In our intrinsic
   evaluation, a classifier based on a lexicon and a BERT-base neural
   network achieved a 0.838 F1-score, a score similar to the score achieved
   by the best classifier on this task during the \#SMM4H'20 competition,
   but it processed the corpus 28 times faster - a positive result, since
   processing speed is still a roadblock to deploying classifiers on large
   cohorts of Twitter users needed for pharmacovigilance. In our extrinsic
   evaluation, our classifier helped a labeler to extract the spans of
   medications more accurately and achieved a 0.76 Strict F1-score. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of medications
   extraction from Twitter timelines and it establishes the first benchmark
   for future studies.},

Abstract = {Background: The association between social isolation and cognitive
   perfor-mance has been less investigated in low-to-middle-income
   countries (LMIC) and the presence of depression as a moderator on this
   association has not been examined. The authors examined the associations
   of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance
   in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this
   cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite
   score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The
   dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered
   memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and
   logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical
   variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms
   with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression,
   measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale,
   modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age
   = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were
   associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI:
   0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B
   = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms
   with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with
   loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker
   association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among
   those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an
   LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse
   cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the
   strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are
   important to assess the direction of the association between social
   isolation and cognitive performance. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2023;

Abstract = {BACKGROUND For pandemic preparedness, researchers used online systematic
   searches to track unplanned school closures (USCs). We determine if
   Twitter provides complementary data.
   METHODS Twitter handles of Michigan public schools and school districts
   were identified. All tweets associated with these handles were
   downloaded. USC-related tweets were identified using 5 keywords.
   Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were
   performed in R.
   RESULTS Among 3469 Michigan public schools, 2003 maintained their own
   active Twitter accounts or belonged to school districts with active
   Twitter accounts. Of these 2003 schools, in 2015-2016 school year, at
   least 1 USC announcement was identified for 349 schools via the current
   method only, 678 schools via Twitter only, and 562 schools via both
   methods. No USC announcements were identified for 414 schools. Rural
   schools were less likely than city schools to have active Twitter
   coverage (adjusted relative risk {[}adjRR] = 0.3956, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 0.3312-0.4671), and to announce USCs on Twitter (adjRR =
   0.5692, 95\% CI 0.4645-0.6823), but more likely to have USCs identified
   by the current method (adjRR = 1.4545, 95\% CI 1.3545-1.5490).
   CONCLUSIONS Each method identified USCs that were missed by the other.
   Our results suggested that identifying USCs on Twitter is complementary
   to the current method.},

Abstract = {Background Although coma is commonly encountered in critical care,
   worldwide variability exists in diagnosis and management practices. We
   aimed to assess variability in coma definitions, etiologies, treatment
   strategies, and attitudes toward prognosis. Methods As part of the
   Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign, between September 2020
   and January 2021, we conducted an anonymous, international,
   cross-sectional global survey of health care professionals caring for
   patients with coma and disorders of consciousness in the acute,
   subacute, or chronic setting. Survey responses were solicited by
   sequential emails distributed by international neuroscience societies
   and social media. Fleiss kappa values were calculated to assess
   agreement among respondents. Results The survey was completed by 258
   health care professionals from 41 countries. Respondents predominantly
   were physicians (n = 213, 83\%), were from the United States (n = 141,
   55\%), and represented academic centers (n = 231, 90\%). Among eight
   predefined items, respondents identified the following cardinal
   features, in various combinations, that must be present to define coma:
   absence of wakefulness (81\%, kappa = 0.764); Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)
   <= 8 (64\%, kappa = 0.588); failure to respond purposefully to visual,
   verbal, or tactile stimuli (60\%, kappa = 0.552); and inability to
   follow commands (58\%, kappa = 0.529). Reported etiologies of coma
   encountered included medically induced coma (24\%), traumatic brain
   injury (24\%), intracerebral hemorrhage (21\%), and cardiac
   arrest/hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (11\%). The most common clinical
   assessment tools used for coma included the GCS (94\%) and neurological
   examination (78\%). Sixty-six percent of respondents routinely performed
   sedation interruption, in the absence of contraindications, for clinical
   coma assessments in the intensive care unit. Advanced neurological
   assessment techniques in comatose patients included quantitative
   electroencephalography (EEG)/connectivity analysis (16\%), functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (7\%), single-photon emission computerized
   tomography (6\%), positron emission tomography (4\%), invasive EEG
   (4\%), and cerebral microdialysis (4\%). The most commonly used
   neurostimulants included amantadine (51\%), modafinil (37\%), and
   methylphenidate (28\%). The leading determinants for prognostication
   included etiology of coma, neurological examination findings, and
   neuroimaging. Fewer than 20\% of respondents reported routine follow-up
   of coma survivors after hospital discharge; however, 86\% indicated
   interest in future research initiatives that include postdischarge
   outcomes at six (85\%) and 12 months (65\%). Conclusions There is wide
   heterogeneity among health care professionals regarding the clinical
   definition of coma and limited routine use of advanced coma assessment
   techniques in acute care settings. Coma management practices vary across
   sites, and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained follow-up after
   acute treatment are inconsistent. There is an urgent need for the
   development of evidence-based guidelines and a collaborative,
   coordinated approach to advance both the science and the practice of
   coma management globally.},

Title = {Enhancing COVID-19 Epidemic Forecasting Accuracy by Combining Real-time
   and Historical Data From Multiple Internet-Based Sources: Analysis of
   Social Media Data, Online News Articles, and Search Queries},

Abstract = {Background: The SARS-COV-2 virus and its variants pose extraordinary
   challenges for public health worldwide. Timely and accurate forecasting
   of the COVID-19 epidemic is key to sustaining interventions and policies
   and efficient resource allocation. Internet-based data sources have
   shown great potential to supplement traditional infectious disease
   surveillance, and the combination of different Internet-based data
   sources has shown greater power to enhance epidemic forecasting accuracy
   than using a single Internet-based data source. However, existing
   methods incorporating multiple Internet-based data sources only used
   real-time data from these sources as exogenous inputs but did not take
   all the historical data into account. Moreover, the predictive power of
   different Internet-based data sources in providing early warning for
   COVID-19 outbreaks has not been fully explored. Objective: The main aim
   of our study is to explore whether combining real-time and historical
   data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve the COVID-19
   forecasting accuracy over the existing baseline models. A secondary aim
   is to explore the COVID-19 forecasting timeliness based on different
   Internet-based data sources. Methods: We first used core terms and
   symptom-related keyword-based methods to extract COVID-19-related
   Internet-based data from December 21, 2019, to February 29, 2020. The
   Internet-based data we explored included 90,493,912 online news
   articles, 37,401,900 microblogs, and all the Baidu search query data
   during that period. We then proposed an autoregressive model with
   exogenous inputs, incorporating real-time and historical data from
   multiple Internet-based sources. Our proposed model was compared with
   baseline models, and all the models were tested during the first wave of
   COVID-19 epidemics in Hubei province and the rest of mainland China
   separately. We also used lagged Pearson correlations for COVID-19
   forecasting timeliness analysis.Results: Our proposed model achieved the
   highest accuracy in all 5 accuracy measures, compared with all the
   baseline models of both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China.
   In mainland China, except for Hubei, the COVID-19 epidemic forecasting
   accuracy differences between our proposed model (model i) and all the
   other baseline models were statistically significant (model 1,
   t198=-8.722, P <.001; model 2, t198=-5.000, P <.001, model 3,
   t198=-1.882, P=.06; model 4, t198=-4.644, P <.001; model 5, t198=-4.488,
   P <.001). In Hubei province, our proposed model's forecasting accuracy
   improved significantly compared with the baseline model using historical
   new confirmed COVID-19 case counts only (model 1, t198=-1.732, P=.09).
   Our results also showed that Internet-based sources could provide a 2-to
   6-day earlier warning for COVID-19 outbreaks.Conclusions: Our approach
   incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based
   sources could improve forecasting accuracy for epidemics of COVID-19 and
   its variants, which may help improve public health agencies'
   interventions and resource allocation in mitigating and controlling new
   waves of COVID-19 or other relevant epidemics.},

Title = {Factors influencing hesitancy towards adult and child COVID-19 vaccines
   in rural and urban West Africa: a cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives This study aims: (1) to identify and describe similarities
   and differences in both adult and child COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and
   (2) to examine sociodemographic, perception-related and behavioural
   factors influencing vaccine hesitancy across five West African
   countries.
   Design Cross-sectional survey carried out between 5 May and 5 June 2021.
   Participants and setting 4198 individuals from urban and rural settings
   in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone participated in
   the survey.
   Study registration The general protocol is registered on
   clinicaltrial.gov.
   Results Findings show that in West Africa at the time only 53\% of all
   study participants reported to be aware of COVID-19 vaccines, and
   television (60\%, n=1345), radio (56\%; n=1258), social media (34\%;
   n=764) and family/friends/neighbours (28\%; n=634) being the most
   important sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Adult COVID-19
   vaccine acceptance ranges from 60\% in Guinea and 50\% in Sierra Leone
   to 11\% in Senegal. This is largely congruent with acceptance levels of
   COVID-19 vaccinations for children. Multivariable regression analysis
   shows that perceived effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines
   increased the willingness to get vaccinated. However, sociodemographic
   factors, such as sex, rural/urban residence, educational attainment and
   household composition (living with children and/or elderly), and the
   other perception parameters were not associated with the willingness to
   get vaccinated in the multivariable regression model.
   Conclusions Primary sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines
   include television, radio and social media. Communication strategies
   addressed at the adult population using mass and social media, which
   emphasise COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety, could encourage
   greater acceptance also of COVID-19 child vaccinations in sub-Saharan
   countries.},

Pages = {E775-E787},
Month = {2022 JUL},
Abstract = {Most Chinese provinces have a daily-updated database of live animal
   movements; however, the data are not efficiently utilized to support
   interventions to control H7N9 and other avian influenzas. Based on
   official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of
   live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and
   monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial
   movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in
   2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi.
   Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of
   inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces.
   Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler
   movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the
   province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar
   New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this
   study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live
   bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017
   were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting
   that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and
   reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same
   small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more
   than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same
   throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and
   improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be
   more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented
   indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that
   targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the
   movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease
   transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence
   to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and
   all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.},

Abstract = {Objective: To summarize changes in recommendations for injection
   treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA) in current clinical practice
   guidelines (CPGs) and to assess whether these changes have affected
   public interest according to Google data and content in YouTube videos.
   Design: A literature search to identify CPGs revised since 2019 that
   provide recommendations regarding the five intra-articular injection
   treatments for knee OA (corticosteroid {[}CS], hyaluronic acid {[}HA],
   stem cell {[}SC], platelet-rich plasma {[}PRP], and botulinum toxin
   {[}BT]) was conducted to assess perspective changes for each treatment.
   Data from Google Trends were examined to identify changes in search
   volume from 2004 to 2021 using a join-point regression model. Relevant
   YouTube videos were divided into those uploaded before and after changes
   in CPGs and compared according to degrees of recom-mendation for each
   treatment to identify the effect of changes in CPGs on video production.
   Results: All eight identified CPGs released after 2019 recommended HA
   and CS use. Most CPGs were the first to state a neutral or opposing
   stance concerning the use of SC, PRP, or BT. Interestingly, relative
   searches on Google for SC, PRP, and BT has increased greater than those
   for CS and HA. YouTube videos produced after CPGs changed continue to
   recommend SC, PRP, and BT as much as those produced before CPGs were
   revised. Conclusions: Although knee OA CPGs have changed, public
   interest and healthcare information providers on YouTube have not
   reacted to this shift. Improved methods to propagate updates to CPGs
   warrant consideration.(c) 2023 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Title = {Direct and Indirect Associations of Media Use With COVID-19 Vaccine
   Hesitancy in South Korea: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background: The battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
   not concluded. Despite the availability of vaccines, the high prevalence
   of vaccine hesitancy represents a significant challenge to public
   health, and raising vaccine acceptance among the public is critical.
   Although media has become an increasingly popular source of COVID-19
   vaccine-related information, the question of whether and how media use
   is related to the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants exploration.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy, (2) identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy, and (3) explore the direct and indirect relationship between
   media use and vaccine hesitancy through psychological factors.
   Methods: A month before COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in South
   Korea, we conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey over 6 days
   (January 20-25, 2021). This study included 1016 participants, and a
   logit model for regression analyzed associations between
   sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, psychological factors,
   and media use toward one's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, we
   conducted a path analysis to examine the indirect effects of media use
   on vaccine hesitancy by using psychological factors (ie, perceived risk
   of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of
   COVID-19 vaccination).
   Results: Among the participants (N=1016), 53.3\% (541/1016) hesitated to
   take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 46.7\% (475/1016) agreed to accept the
   vaccine. Of the sociodemographic factors, female gender (odds ratio
   {[}OR] 1.967, 95\% CI 1.36-2.86; P<.001), age in 50s (OR 0.47, 95\% CI
   0.23-0.96; P=.004), and age over 60s (OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.24-0.99; P=.04)
   were significant individual predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
   Perceived susceptibility of infection (OR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.52-0.91;
   P=.01) and perceived benefits of vaccination (OR 0.69, 95\% CI
   0.52-0.91; P=.01) were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy.
   Perceived barriers of vaccination (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.29-2.07; P<.001)
   and lower trust in government (OR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.53-0.98; P=.04) were
   related to vaccine hesitancy. The use of offline and online media as
   sources for the perceived benefits of vaccination was associated with
   vaccine hesitancy, resulting in lower vaccine hesitancy. Moreover,
   perceived susceptibility of the disease and perceived barriers of
   vaccination mediated the association between social media use and
   vaccine hesitancy.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed a considerable level of COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy in South Korea. Gender-based and generation-based
   public health policies and communication are recommended. Efforts to
   lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived
   benefits of the vaccine are required. Although the use of media has a
   positive and negative effect on the population's vaccine hesitancy,
   efforts should be made to disseminate reliable and timely information on
   media while confronting misinformation or disinformation for successive
   implementation of vaccine programs during pandemics.},

Title = {Case report for an internet- and mobile-based intervention for internet
   use disorder},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Background and aims: Internet use disorder (IUD), characterized as the
   inability to control one's internet use, is associated with reduced
   quality of life and mental health comorbidities such as depression,
   substance abuse, or anxiety. Evidence-based treatment options are scarce
   due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based
   interventions (IMI) may be an effective means to deliver psychological
   treatment to individuals with IUD as they address affected individuals
   in their online setting. This study presents a newly developed IMI for
   IUD disclosing treatment satisfaction and preliminary effects by
   exemplifying with a case report.
   Methods: The case of a female participant with IUD, characterized by an
   excessive use of social media, is analyzed. The case report follows the
   CARE guidelines and presents qualitative and quantitative outcomes
   regarding potential symptom reduction measured by the Internet Addiction
   Test (IAT) and Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS), treatment
   satisfaction measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) and
   feasibility by analyzing participant's written feedback during
   treatment.
   Results: The case report shows that internet- and mobile-based
   interventions may be feasible in supporting an individual in reducing
   symptoms of IUD as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and
   procrastination behavior. Treatment satisfaction was reported as good.
   Discussion and conclusions: This case report illustrates that IMIs can
   have the potential to be an easily accessible and possibly effective
   treatment option for IUD. Case studies on IMIs may provide insights into
   important mechanisms for symptom change. Further studies are needed to
   expand our understanding of this diverse disorder to provide adequate
   treatment.},

Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Web scraping and text mining are popular computer science methods
   deployed by public health researchers to augment traditional
   epidemiological surveillance. However, within veterinary disease
   surveillance, such techniques are still in the early stages of
   development and have not yet been fully utilised. This study presents an
   exploration into the utility of incorporating internet-based data to
   better understand smallholder farming communities within the UK, by
   using online text extraction and the subsequent mining of this data. Web
   scraping of the livestock fora was conducted, with text mining and topic
   modelling of data in search of common themes, words, and topics found
   within the text, in addition to temporal analysis through anomaly
   detection. Results revealed that some of the key areas in pig forum
   discussions included identification, age management, containment, and
   breeding and weaning practices. In discussions about poultry farming, a
   preference for free-range practices was expressed, along with a focus on
   feeding practices and addressing red mite infestations. Temporal topic
   modelling revealed an increase in conversations around pig containment
   and care, as well as poultry equipment maintenance. Moreover, anomaly
   detection was discovered to be particularly effective for tracking
   unusual spikes in forum activity, which may suggest new concerns or
   trends. Internet data can be a very effective tool in aiding traditional
   veterinary surveillance methods, but the requirement for human
   validation of said data is crucial. This opens avenues of research via
   the incorporation of other dynamic social media data, namely Twitter, in
   addition to location analysis to highlight spatial patterns.},

Abstract = {Epidemiological models for the spread of pathogens in a population are
   usually only able to describe a single pathogen. This makes their
   application unrealistic in cases where multiple pathogens with similar
   symptoms are spreading concurrently within the same population. Here we
   describe a method which makes possible the application of multiple
   single-strain models under minimal conditions. As such, our method
   provides a bridge between theoretical models of epidemiology and
   data-driven approaches for modeling of influenza and other similar
   viruses.
   Our model extends the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to higher
   dimensions, allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple
   viruses. We further provide a method, based on an overcomplete
   dictionary of feasible realizations of SIR solutions, to blindly
   partition the time series representing the number of infected people in
   a population into individual components, each representing the effect of
   a single pathogen.
   We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on five years of
   seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, estimated from Twitter
   data. We demonstrate that our method describes, on average, 44\% of the
   variance in the ILl time series. The individual infectious components
   derived from our model are matched to known viral profiles in the
   populations, which we demonstrate matches that of independently
   collected epidemiological data. We further show that the basic
   reproductive numbers (RO) of the matched components are in range known
   for these pathogens.
   Our results suggest that the proposed method can be applied to other
   pathogens and geographies, providing a simple method for estimating the
   parameters of epidemics in a population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Background: Gaining insights that cannot be obtained from health care
   databases from patients has become an important topic in
   pharmacovigilance. Objective: Our objective was to demonstrate a use
   case, in which patient-generated data were incorporated in
   pharmacovigilance, to understand the epidemiology and burden of illness
   in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods: We used
   data on systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that
   substantially impairs quality of life, from 2 independent data sets. To
   understand the disease's epidemiology, we analyzed a Japanese health
   insurance claims database. To understand the disease's burden, we
   analyzed text data collected from Japanese disease blogs (tobyoki)
   written by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Natural language
   processing was applied to these texts to identify frequent patient-level
   complaints, and term frequency-inverse document frequency was used to
   explore patient burden during treatment. We explored health-related
   quality of life based on patient descriptions. Results: We analyzed data
   from 4694 and 635 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in the
   health insurance claims database and tobyoki blogs, respectively. Based
   on health insurance claims data, the prevalence of systemic lupus
   erythematosus is 107.70 per 100,000 persons. Tobyoki text data analysis
   showed that pain-related words (eg, pain, severe pain, arthralgia)
   became more important after starting treatment. We also found an
   increase in patients' references to mobility and self-care over time,
   which indicated increased attention to physical disability due to
   disease progression. Conclusions: A classical medical database
   represents only a part of a patient's entire treatment experience, and
   analysis using solely such a database cannot represent patient-level
   symptoms or patient concerns about treatments. This study showed that
   analysis of tobyoki blogs can provide added information on patient-level
   details, advancing patient-centric pharmacovigilance.},

Abstract = {Aggregation of children in schools has been established to be a key
   driver of transmission of infectious diseases. Mathematical models of
   transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as
   vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data.
   However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen
   transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used
   Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within
   two secondary schools in England and test for associations between
   self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain
   collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact
   survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through
   self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates
   from the local community were also sequenced to assess the
   representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked
   transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and
   social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools
   is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found
   no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission,
   increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age
   children may be an important source of community transmission.},

Title = {Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis of the Public Discourse on Twitter
   about COVID-19 and MPox},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mining and analysis of the big data of Twitter conversations have been
   of significant interest to the scientific community in the fields of
   healthcare, epidemiology, big data, data science, computer science, and
   their related areas, as can be seen from several works in the last few
   years that focused on sentiment analysis and other forms of text
   analysis of tweets related to Ebola, E-Coli, Dengue, Human
   Papillomavirus (HPV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Measles,
   Zika virus, H1N1, influenza-like illness, swine flu, flu, Cholera,
   Listeriosis, cancer, Liver Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, kidney
   disease, lupus, Parkinson's, Diphtheria, and West Nile virus. The recent
   outbreaks of COVID-19 and MPox have served as ``catalysts{''} for
   Twitter usage related to seeking and sharing information, views,
   opinions, and sentiments involving both of these viruses. None of the
   prior works in this field analyzed tweets focusing on both COVID-19 and
   MPox simultaneously. To address this research gap, a total of 61,862
   tweets that focused on MPox and COVID-19 simultaneously, posted between
   7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023, were studied. The findings and
   contributions of this study are manifold. First, the results of
   sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for
   sEntiment Reasoning) approach shows that nearly half the tweets
   (46.88\%) had a negative sentiment. It was followed by tweets that had a
   positive sentiment (31.97\%) and tweets that had a neutral sentiment
   (21.14\%), respectively. Second, this paper presents the top 50 hashtags
   used in these tweets. Third, it presents the top 100 most frequently
   used words in these tweets after performing tokenization, removal of
   stopwords, and word frequency analysis. The findings indicate that
   tweets in this context included a high level of interest regarding
   COVID-19, MPox and other viruses, President Biden, and Ukraine. Finally,
   a comprehensive comparative study that compares the contributions of
   this paper with 49 prior works in this field is presented to further
   uphold the relevance and novelty of this work.},

   The source of the upload of each video was determined to be one of the
   following: (1) consumer, (2) professional (MD, RN)/government, (3) any
   news (television-based, internet-based, or print/radio). Content
   categories were created using a fact sheet from the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention.
   Results: Videos uploaded by a news source tended to have been uploaded
   more recently (2015-2018) compared to other sources (p < 0.001). Videos
   uploaded by consumers or news sources tended to have more views than
   professional/government-uploaded videos (p=0.044). Videos uploaded by
   news sources were more likely to mention a specific outbreak (p <
   0.001), statistics (p = 0.004), and transmission via raw meat (p =
   0.036), feces (p = 0.006), vegetables or produce (p = 0.006), and
   processing techniques (p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: YouTube videos on the topic were widely divergent, and
   varied in content, emphasizing different aspects of concern over hazards
   associated with E. coli. Consumer sources, rather than experts, were the
   most common source of upload of the most highly viewed videos.
   Government agencies, which collect and analyze public health data, do
   not appear to use YouTube effectively to disseminate information. This
   underscores the need for media to work with government agencies to
   provide accurate, timely information to the public. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Purpose: To examine how recent sex work is identified and the HIV risk
   factors and service needs among Thai cisgender men who have sex with men
   (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) who exchange sex.
   Methods: MSM and TGW in Bangkok and Pattaya who exchanged sex in the
   last year (n = 890) were recruited through social media, outreach, and
   word-of-mouth. Recent sex exchange was based on the primary question,
   ``In the last 30 days, have you sold or traded sex{''}; secondary
   questions (regarding income source and client encounters) were also
   investigated.
   Results: Overall, 436 (48\%) participants engaged in sex work in the
   last 30 days; among those, 270 (62\%) reported exchanging sex by the
   primary question, and 160 (37\%) based on secondary questions only.
   Recent sex exchange was associated with gonorrhea, syphilis, discussing
   PrEP with others, and using condoms, alcohol, methamphetamine, amyl
   nitrate, and Viagra. Exchanging sex based on secondary questions only
   was associated with being in a relationship, social media recruitment,
   less recent anal intercourse, and not discussing PrEP.
   Conclusions: Thai MSM and TGW who exchange sex need regular access to
   HIV/STI prevention, testing, and treatment services, and multiple
   approaches to assessing sex work will help identify and serve this
   diverse and dynamic population. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Cross-sectional Study of Factors Associated With Suicide Ideation in

Abstract = {Objective Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Canadian
   adolescents. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide attempts to explain
   suicide etiology and proposes that feelings of perceived burdensomeness
   or thwarted belongingness lead to suicide ideation, but this has not
   been extensively studied in adolescents. This study aimed to use the
   Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to examine factors that may be
   associated with suicide ideation in adolescents. The factors of interest
   were school connectedness, perceived availability of support,
   self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hopelessness,
   bullying and cyberbullying victimization, substance use, and social
   media use. Methods Data were from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and
   Health Survey, a survey of 7th to 12th graders enrolled in a publicly
   funded school in Ontario. Weighted multivariate logistic regression of
   suicide ideation on all exposure variables was conducted. Results 13.6\%
   of students in the sample endorsed having suicidal ideation in the
   preceding 12 months. Not knowing where to turn to for support, feeling
   worthless, endorsing low self-esteem, being bullied, and using cannabis
   were each associated with greater odds of suicide ideation. Feeling
   hopeless, social media use, using alcohol and tobacco, and being
   cyberbullied were not associated with suicide ideation in the weighted
   multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusions This study is
   consistent with the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as low self-esteem
   and feelings of worthlessness, two indicators of perceived
   burdensomeness, and not knowing where to turn to for support, an
   indicator of thwarted belongingness, were associated with greater odds
   of suicide ideation. These findings can help guide interventions aimed
   at reducing the burden of suicidality during adolescence and demonstrate
   the need to provide accessible mental health support for youth.},

Title = {The Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI): Overview and methods},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {61-69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background-Genetic factors contribute to anorexia nervosa (AN); and the
   first genome-wide significant locus has been identified. We describe
   methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative
   (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit
   13,000 individuals with AN and ancestrally matched controls. We present
   sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder
   diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population
   research.
   Methods: ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New
   Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via
   national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and
   social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN
   diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea).
   Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating
   behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of
   the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also
   completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H.
   Results: Blood samples and clinical information were collected from
   13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic
   phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the
   questionnaire was acceptable.
   Conclusions: Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective
   for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other
   groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the
   Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some
   countries. ANGI has substantially augmented Psychiatric Genomics
   Consortium AN sample collection.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite increased awareness of infection control
   precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still
   spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial
   burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for
   contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic
   case-control study and to validate health care network changes during
   pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on
   hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with
   matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1
   year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links
   joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over
   time.
   Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths
   of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care
   providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in
   the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of the network at one
   campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many
   roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.
   Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible
   transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes
   measured in the traditional case control study. (C) 2019 Association for

Title = {Collective Response to Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Reddit
   and Wikipedia: Mixed-Methods Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background: The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic
   outbreaks may alter people's risk perception and trigger behavioral
   changes, which can ultimately affect the evolution of the disease. It is
   thus of utmost importance to map the dissemination of information by
   mainstream media outlets and the public response to this information.
   However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during the
   COVID-19 pandemic is still limited.
   Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize the media coverage
   and collective internet response to the COVID-19 pandemic in four
   countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada
   Methods: We collected a heterogeneous data set including 227,768
   web-based news articles and 13,448 YouTube videos published by
   mainstream media outlets, 107,898 user posts and 3,829,309 comments on
   the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views of
   COVID-19-related Wikipedia pages. To analyze the relationship between
   media coverage, epidemic progression, and users' collective web-based
   response, we considered a linear regression model that predicts the
   public response for each country given the amount of news exposure. We
   also applied topic modelling to the data set using nonnegative matrix
   factorization.
   Results: Our results show that public attention, quantified as user
   activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly
   driven by media coverage; meanwhile, this activity declines rapidly
   while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore,
   using an unsupervised, dynamic topic modeling approach, we show that
   while the levels of attention dedicated to different topics by media
   outlets and internet users are in good accordance, interesting
   deviations emerge in their temporal patterns.
   Conclusions: Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret
   public perception and response to the current global health emergency
   and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on
   people's collective awareness and risk perception and thus on their
   tendencies toward behavioral change.},

Abstract = {Risk perception has a significant impact on decisions people make when
   facing a threat: a mismatch between actual hazard and perceived risk can
   lead to inappropriate behaviours and suboptimal compliance to
   recommended public health measures. The present study was conducted in
   the aftermath of a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak that occurred in 2019 in a
   primary school in Italy. The aim was to evaluate the impact of
   communication measures implemented by local health authorities
   (including face-to-face meetings between LHAs and the local population,
   weekly press announcements, implementation of a telephone hotline and of
   an information desk, and social media communication), on risk perception
   among parents of schoolchildren and school staff, and to identify
   factors related to a change in risk perception before and after the said
   activities. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to parents of
   schoolchildren (n = 846) and to school staff (n = 70). Participants were
   asked about the level of risk they had perceived at two distinct times:
   when they first became aware of the outbreak and following
   implementation of communication activities. A significant reduction of
   perceived risk was found in both groups (p < 0.001) following the
   communication activities. The largest reduction was found among
   participants who reported having appreciated the meetings with the LHA
   healthcare staff. Our findings suggest that keeping an open approach,
   explaining the actual threat to the population and adapting
   communication to different listening skills, are essential for health
   authorities to successfully manage a public health emergency.},

Title = {Knowledge level and factors influencing prevention of COVID-19 pandemic
   among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha City administrations, North-East
   Ethiopia: a population-based cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Objective
   In Ethiopia, community-level knowledge about the current COVID-19
   pandemic has not been well studied. This study is aimed to assess
   knowledge level and factors influencing the prevention of the COVID-19
   pandemic among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha city administrations,
   Ethiopia.
   Design
   Community-based cross-sectional study.
   Settings
   Dessie and Kombolcha city administrations.
   Participants
   Participants were household heads or members (n=828, >18 years) who have
   lived in the study area for at least 2 months preceding the survey.
   Methods
   Binary logistic regression was used for a single outcome and multiple
   response variables. In the multivariable regression model, a value of
   p<0.05 and adjusted OR (AOR) with 95\% CI were used to identify factors
   associated with knowledge level of the community. Epi Info V.7.2 and
   SPSS V.20 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively.
   Outcome
   Knowledge level.
   Results
   A total of 828 participants was involved with a response rate of 98\%.
   Women were 61.7\%. Participants' mean (+/- SD) age was 39 (+/- 14)
   years. Of the total participants 54.11\% (95\% CI 50.6\% to 57.6\%) had
   inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 prevention. Significant associations
   were reported among women (AOR=1.41; 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.92); age >= 65
   years (AOR=2.72; 95\% CI 1.45 to 5.11); rural residence (AOR=2.69; 95\%
   CI 1.78 to 4.07); unable to read and write (AOR=1.60; 95\% CI 1.02 to
   2.51); information not heard from healthcare workers, mass media and
   social media (AOR=1.95; 95\% CI 1.35 to 2.82), (AOR=2.5; 95\% CI 1.58 to
   4.19) and (AOR=2.13; 95\% CI 1.33 to 3.42), respectively, with
   inadequate knowledge.
   Conclusion
   These findings revealed that more than 50\% of participants had
   inadequate knowledge about COVID-19. It highlights the need for
   widespread awareness campaigns about COVID-19 through mass media,
   healthcare professionals and social media as sources of information.
   House-to-house awareness creation is recommended to address older adults
   who are more vulnerable to the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about prevalence and etiology of running-related injuries
   (RRIs) is important to design effective RRI prevention programs. Mental
   aspects and sleep quality seem to be important potential risk factors,
   yet their association with RRIs needs to be elucidated. The aims of this
   study are to investigate the epidemiology of RRIs in recreational
   runners and the association of mental aspects, sleep, and other
   potential factors with RRIs. An internet-based questionnaire was sent to
   recreational runners recruited through social media, asking for personal
   and training characteristics, mental aspects (obsessive passion,
   motivation to exercise), sleep quality, perceived health, quality of
   life, foot arch type, and RRIs over the past six months. Data were
   analyzed descriptively and using logistic regression. Self-reported data
   from 804 questionnaires were analyzed. Twenty-five potential risk
   factors for RRIs were investigated. 54\% of runners reported at least
   one RRI. The knee was the most-affected location (45\%), followed by the
   lower leg (19\%). Patellofemoral pain syndrome was the most-reported
   injury (20\%), followed by medial tibial stress syndrome (17\%).
   Obsessive passionate attitude (odds ratio (OR):1.35; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI):1.18-1.54), motivation to exercise (OR:1.09;
   CI:1.03-1.15), and sleep quality (OR:1.23; CI:1.15-1.31) were associated
   with RRIs, as were perceived health (OR:0.96; CI:0.94-0.97), running
   over 20 km/week (OR:1.58; CI:1.04-2.42), overweight (OR:2.17;
   CI:1.41-3.34), pes planus (OR:1.80; CI:1.12-2.88), hard-surface running
   (OR:1.37; CI:1.17-1.59), running company (OR:1.65; CI:1.16-2.35), and
   following a training program (OR:1.51; CI:1.09-2.10). These factors
   together explained 30\% of the variance in RRIs. A separate regression
   analysis showed that mental aspects and sleep quality explain 15\% of
   the variance in RRIs. The association of mental aspects and sleep
   quality with RRIs adds new insights into the multifactorial etiology of
   RRIs. We therefore recommend that besides common risk factors for RRI,
   mental aspects and sleep be incorporated into the advice on prevention
   and management of RRIs.},

Abstract = {This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect
   contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs
   through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China.
   All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from
   the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed.
   Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the
   network between source counties was the primary objective of this study.
   A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network
   were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated
   for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of
   different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an
   epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from
   151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in
   January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from
   one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001)
   than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from
   counties inside Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan,
   Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties
   (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the two-month
   study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km
   from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January
   and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in
   January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a
   shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The
   most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and
   western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing
   counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness,
   degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of
   a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform
   targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig
   market trade network in south China.},

Abstract = {The presence of patients affected by different diseases at the same time
   is becoming a major health and societal issue. In clinical literature,
   this phenomenon is known as comorbidity, and it can be studied from the
   administrative databases of general practitioners' prescriptions based
   on diagnoses. In this contribution, we propose a two-step strategy for
   analyzing comorbidity patterns. In the first step, we investigate the
   prescription data with association rules extracted by a two-mode network
   (or bipartite graph) to find frequent itemsets that can be used to
   assist physicians in making diagnoses. In the second step, we derive a
   one-mode network of the diseases codes with association rules, and we
   perform the k-core partitioning algorithm to identify the most relevant
   and connected parts in the network corresponding to the most related
   pathologies.},

Abstract = {Background: The correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
   during the Covid-19 pandemic is mandatory to minimize the contagion
   risk. The current study aimed to evaluate quality information of YouTube
   videos on PPE use during the pandemic. Methods: Using Google Trend tool,
   the frequency of worldwide YouTube and Google searches for ``donning and
   doffing{''} was examined. We queried YouTube with terms related to
   donning and doffing of PPE. Validated quality information assessment
   tools were used. Results: From the December 1, 2019 to the January 31,
   2021, according to YouTube and Google searches, both peaks occurred in
   April 2020 (69.5\% and 72.0\%, respectively). Of all videos, 144 were
   eligible for the analyses. According to misinformation tool, 90 (62.5\%)
   videos contained inaccuracies. The median DISCERN Section 1 ranged from
   3 to 5. The median DISCERN Section 3 was 4. According to Global Quality
   Score, 8.3\% (n = 12), 14.6\% (n = 21), 22.9\% (n = 33), 30.6\% (n = 44)
   and 23.6\% (n = 34) were classified as poor, partially poor, moderate,
   partially good and excellent quality videos, respectively. Conclusions:
   Nowadays, YouTube may be recommended as a reliable source of
   information. Nevertheless, a not negligible number of videos contained
   inaccuracies. Future authors should improve videos contents to provide
   more complete information. (c) 2021 Association for Professionals in

Abstract = {Introduction Improving our understanding of the broad range of social,
   emotional and behavioural factors that contribute to mental health
   outcomes in adolescents will be greatly enhanced with diverse,
   representative population samples. We present a protocol for a repeated
   self-report survey assessing risk and protective factors for mental
   health and well-being in school pupils aged 8-18 years with different
   socioeconomic backgrounds in England. The survey will provide a
   comprehensive picture of mental health and associated risks at the
   community level to inform the development of primary and secondary
   prevention and treatment strategies in schools. Methods and analysis
   This protocol is for a large-scale online repeated self-report survey,
   representative of children and adolescents aged 8-18 years attending
   schools or further education colleges in participating counties in
   England. The survey consists of around 300 questions, including
   validated measures of mental health and well-being, risk and protective
   factors, and care-seeking behaviour and preferences. Additional
   questions each year vary to address current events and novel hypotheses,
   developed by the research team, collaborators and stakeholders. Primary
   analyses will investigate current and changing risk and protective
   factors, care-seeking behaviour and attitudes to allowing linkage of
   their sensitive data to other databases for research, and will compare
   measures of mental health to measures of well-being. Ethics and
   dissemination The study was approved by the University of Oxford
   Research Ethics Committee (Reference: R62366). Tailored data summaries
   will be provided to participating schools and stakeholders within 3
   months of data collection. The main findings will be presented at
   scientific meetings, published in peer-reviewed journals and shared via
   digital and social media channels. At the end of the study, other
   researchers will be able to apply for access to anonymous data extracts.},

Title = {Google Trends-based non-English language query data and epidemic
   diseases: a cross-sectional study of the popular search behaviour in
   Taiwan},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Objective This study developed a surveillance system suitable for
   monitoring epidemic outbreaks and assessing public opinion in
   non-English-speaking countries. We evaluated whether social media
   reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and
   natural catastrophes.
   Design Cross-sectional study.
   Setting Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan.
   Main outcome measure We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained
   from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data
   obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To
   validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance
   tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and
   epidemic incidence in Taiwan.
   Results With our approach, we noted that keywords (sic)(sic) ('common
   cold'), (sic)(sic) ('fever') and (sic)(sic) ('cough') exhibited good to
   excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza
   incidence (r=0.898, p < 0.001; r=0.773, p < 0.001; r=0.796, p < 0.001,
   respectively). They also displayed high correlation with influenza-like
   illness emergencies (r=0.900, p < 0.001; r=0.802, p < 0.001; r=0.886, p
   < 0.001, respectively) and outpatient visits (r=0.889, p < 0.001;
   r=0.791, p < 0.001; r=0.870, p<0.001, respectively). We noted that the
   query (sic)(sic)(sic) ('enterovirus') exhibited excellent correlation
   with the number of enterovirus-infected patients in emergency
   departments (r=0.914, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions These results suggested that Google Trends can be a good
   surveillance tool for epidemic outbreaks, even in Taiwan, the
   non-English-speaking country. Online search activity indicates that
   people are concerned about epidemic diseases, even if they do not visit
   hospitals. This prompted us to develop useful tools to monitor social
   media during an epidemic because such media usage reflects infectious
   disease trends more quickly than does traditional reporting.},

Title = {Pedagogical Demonstration of Twitter Data Analysis: A Case Study of
   World AIDS Day, 2014},

Abstract = {As a pedagogical demonstration of Twitter data analysis, a case study of
   HIV/AIDS-related tweets around World AIDS Day, 2014, was presented. This
   study examined if Twitter users from countries with various income
   levels responded differently to World AIDS Day. The performance of
   support vector machine (SVM) models as classifiers of relevant tweets
   was evaluated. A manual coding of 1,826 randomly sampled
   HIV/AIDS-related original tweets from November 30 through December 2,
   2014 was completed. Logistic regression was applied to analyze the
   association between the World Bank-designated income level of users'
   self-reported countries and Twitter contents. To identify the optimal
   SVM model, 1278 (70\%) of the 1826 sampled tweets were randomly selected
   as the training set, and 548 (30\%) served as the test set. Another 180
   tweets were separately sampled and coded as the held-out dataset.
   Compared with tweets from low-income countries, tweets from the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries had 60\%
   lower odds to mention epidemiology (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.404;
   95\% CI: 0.166, 0.981) and three times the odds to mention
   compassion/support (aOR = 3.080; 95\% CI: 1.179, 8.047). Tweets from
   lower-middle-income countries had 79\% lower odds than tweets from
   low-income countries to mention HIV-affected sub-populations (aOR =
   0.213; 95\% CI: 0.068, 0.664). The optimal SVM model was able to
   identify relevant tweets from the held-out dataset of 180 tweets with an
   accuracy (F1 score) of 0.72. This study demonstrated how students can be
   taught to analyze Twitter data using manual coding, regression models,
   and SVM models.},

Title = {Day-1 Competencies for Veterinarians Specific to Health Informatics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {In 2015, the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC)
   developed the Competency-Based Veterinary Education (CBVE) framework to
   prepare practice-ready veterinarians through competency-based education,
   which is an outcomes-based approach to equipping students with the
   skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, and abilities to do their jobs.
   With increasing use of health informatics (HI: the use of information
   technology to deliver healthcare) by veterinarians, competencies in HI
   need to be developed. To reach consensus on a HI competency framework in
   this study, the Competency Framework Development (CFD) process was
   conducted using an online adaptation of Developing-A-Curriculum, an
   established methodology in veterinary medicine for reaching consensus
   among experts. The objectives of this study were to (1) create an HI
   competency framework for new veterinarians; (2) group the competency
   statements into common themes; (3) map the HI competency statements to
   the AAVMC competencies as illustrative sub-competencies; (4) provide
   insight into specific technologies that are currently relevant to new
   veterinary graduates; and (5) measure panelist satisfaction with the CFD
   process. The primary emphasis of the final HI competency framework was
   that veterinarians must be able to assess, select, and implement
   technology to optimize the client-patient experience, delivery of
   healthcare, and work-life balance for the veterinary team. Veterinarians
   must also continue their own education regarding technology by engaging
   relevant experts and opinion leaders.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Long COVID is a condition distinguished by long-term sequelae that occur
   or persist after the convalescence period of COVID-19. During the
   COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people who tested positive for
   SARS-CoV-2 experienced long COVID, which attracted the attention of
   researchers. This study aims to assess the pattern of long COVID
   research literature, analyze the research topics, and provide insights
   on long COVID. In this study, we extracted 784 publications from Scopus
   in the field of long COVID. According to bibliometric analysis, it is
   found that: developed countries in Europe and America were in leading
   positions in terms of paper productivity and citations. The
   International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health and
   the Journal of Clinical Medicine were leading journals in the
   perspective of publications count, and Nature Medicine had the highest
   number of citations. Author Greenhalgh T has the highest number of
   papers and citations. The main research topics were: pathophysiology,
   symptoms, treatment, and epidemiology. The causes of long COVID may be
   related to organ injury, inflammation, maladaptation of the
   angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway, and mental factors. The
   symptoms are varied, including physical and psychological symptoms.
   Treatment options vary from person to person. Most patients developed at
   least one long-term symptom. Finally, we presented some possible
   research opportunities.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study assesses the role of social capital among people and
   communities in response to the first wave of the pandemic in
   2020.DesignQualitative study using focus group
   discussions.SettingCapital city (Bangkok) and the four regions (north,
   northeast, south and central) of Thailand.Participants161 participants
   of 19 focus groups with diverse backgrounds in terms of gender,
   profession, education and geography (urban/rural; regions). They are
   selected for different levels of impact from the pandemic.FindingsThe
   solidarity among the Thai people was a key contributing factor to
   societal resilience during the pandemic. Findings illustrate how three
   levels of social capital structure-family, community and local
   networks-mobilised resources from internal and external social networks
   to support people affected by the pandemic. The results also highlight
   different types of resources mobilised from the three levels of social
   capital, factors that affect resilience, collective action to combat the
   negative impacts of the pandemic, and the roles of social media and
   gender.ConclusionSocial capital plays significant roles in the
   resilience of individuals, households and communities to respond to and
   recover from the impacts of the pandemic. In many instances, social
   capital is a faster and more efficient response than other kinds of
   formal support. Social capital can be enhanced by interactions and
   exchanges in the communities. While face-to-face social contacts are
   challenged by the need for social distancing and travel restrictions,
   social media steps in as alternative socialisation to enhance social
   capital.},

Abstract = {Objective To describe breastfeeding prevalence and maternal experience
   in infants with trisomy 21. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting
   Participants from UK recruited through websites, social media and local

   (DS) recruited to the Feeding and Autoimmunity in Down Syndrome
   Evaluation Study between 1 September 2014 and 31 August 2017. Seventy
   participants: median age 20 weeks (IQR 13-29 weeks) at initial
   questionnaire. Main outcome measure Breastfeeding prevalence at 6 weeks
   and 6 months among infants with DS. Results The prevalence of exclusive
   breast feeding among study participants was similar to the general
   population (13/61, 21\% vs 23\% at 6 weeks, 2/54, 4\% vs 1\% at 6
   months). However, the prevalence of breast feeding (exclusive or
   combination feeding) among the study participants was higher than the
   general population (39/61 64\% vs 55\% at 6 weeks, 32/59 54\% vs 34\% at
   6 months). Conclusion Although there may be challenges in establishing
   breast feeding in infants with DS, our data suggest that exclusive
   breast feeding is possible for some, and the prevalence of breast
   feeding is comparable to the prevalence in the general population.},

Title = {Mapping obesity and diabetes' representation on Twitter: the case of
   Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {One of the main functions of public health is to monitor population
   health to identify health problems and priorities. Social media is
   increasingly being used to promote it. This study aims to investigate
   the field of diabetes and obesity and related tweets in the context of
   health and disease. The database extracted using academic APIs
   (Application Programming Interfaces) allowed the study to be run with
   content analysis and sentiment analysis techniques. These two analysis
   techniques are some of the tools of choice for the intended objectives.
   Content analysis facilitated the representation of a concept and a
   connection between two or more concepts, such as diabetes and obesity,
   on a purely text-based social platform such as Twitter. Sentiment
   analysis therefore allowed us to explore the emotional aspect related to
   the collected data related to the representation of such concepts. The
   results show a variety of representations connected to the two concepts
   and their correlations. From them it was possible to produce some
   clusters of elementary contexts and structure narrative and
   representational dimensions of the investigated concepts. The use of
   sentiment analysis and content analysis and cluster output to represent
   complex contexts such as diabetes and obesity for a social media
   community could increase knowledge of how virtual platforms impact
   fragile categories, facilitating concrete spillovers into public health
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Background: Latino communities in the United States and Latin America
   are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed
   information shared on Twitter in Spanish language for insights into the
   public's communication and information needs about the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methods: We performed a mixed-methods analysis using a text
   mining approach. We used SAS Text Miner, an algorithmic-driven
   statistical program to capture 10,000 tweets posted between June 3,
   2020, and June 10, 2020. We used the following search terms to capture
   relevant Twitter messages in Spanish language: ``coronavirus,{''}
   ``covid-19,{''} ``corona,{''} and the hash tags ``\#COVID19{''} and
   ``\#Coronavirus.{''} Key text topics were identified and categorized
   into themes using an emergent content analysis. Results: We identified
   12 text topics and six themes: (1) prevention measures, (2)
   epidemiology/surveillance, (3) economic impact, (4) optimizing nursing
   workforce, (5) access to reliable information, and (6) call for a
   response from the local government. Top trending hashtags from our
   search included \#COVID19 (n = 7,098), \#Coronavirus (n = 6,394), and
   \#SNTESALUD (n = 2,598). Conclusions: Spanish-language Tweets related to
   the COVID-19 pandemic contained information from health departments and
   labor unions on the surveillance, prevention, and impact of COVID-19.
   Public health officials should consider increasing their use of Twitter
   to ensure a wide dissemination of messages about COVID-19 in Spanish
   outlets.},

Title = {FIVE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG WITH MEDIA VIOLENCE RESEARCH},
Booktitle = {THEORIZING CRIMINALITY AND POLICING IN THE DIGITAL MEDIA AGE},
Series = {Studies in Media and Communications},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {169-187},
Abstract = {Purpose: Media violence theorists made five methodological errors, which
   have muddled theory construction. As such, the validity of the claim
   that media-violence must share blame for a rise in aggression in society
   is suspect.
   Approach: Here, the authors explain those five errors: (1) Subclinical
   psychopathologies interact with media messages in detectable ways. Media
   violence researchers never paid attention to the composition of their
   participant samples. Consequently, they were never aware of the inherent
   vulnerabilities, or immunities, to media violence of their participants.
   (2) Media violence researchers used convenience samples when they should
   have used random samples to study media violence. The nature of the
   research questions they were asking required the use of random samples.
   But, with the use of convenience samples, those samples never matched
   the populations they were designed to examine. (3) Media violence
   researchers used expansive variable lists that probably triggered
   family-wise interaction effects, thus reporting interactions between
   independent and dependent variables that were meaningless. (4) Most
   media violence data are correlational. So, researchers used converged
   data from correlational studies to infer causation. But their
   convergence procedures were improperly executed, which led to incorrect
   interpretations. (5) Media violence researchers, from the outset of
   their work in the 1980s, pathologized media violence first, then set
   about trying to find out how it presumably harmed society. Those
   researchers should have considered the idea that media violence is
   nothing more than mere entertainment for most people.
   Value: In addition to questioning the claims made by media violence
   researchers, these five errors serve as a cautionary tale to social
   media researchers. Scholars investigating the effects of social media
   use might consider the possibility that social media are nothing more
   than new modes of communication.},

Title = {Network analysis of frailty and aging: Empirical data from the Mexican
   Health and Aging Study},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Frailty remains a challenge in the aging research area with
   a number of gaps in knowledge still to be filled. Frailty seems to
   behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter.
   Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was
   the main purpose of our study.
   Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012,
   mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit
   frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The
   edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning,
   and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic
   graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms,
   hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the
   graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and
   tertiles of the total FI score.
   Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8\%
   were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of
   connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As
   the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how
   the nodes are connected changed.
   Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network.
   Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health
   (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits
   related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are
   considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with
   vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all
   deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and
   non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the
   construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify
   the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the
   development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of
   frailty in older adults.},

Title = {Nairobi Early Childcare in Slums (NECS) Study Protocol: a mixed-methods

Journal = {BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe early years are critical. Early nurturing care can lay
   the foundation for human capital accumulation with lifelong benefits.
   Conversely, early adversity undermines brain development, learning and
   future earning.Slums are among the most challenging places to spend
   those early years and are difficult places to care for a child. Shifting
   family and work structures mean that paid, largely informal, childcare
   seems to be becoming the `new normal' for many preschool children
   growing up in rapidly urbanising Africa. However, little is known about
   the quality of this childcare.AimsTo build a rigorous understanding what
   childcare strategies are used and why in a typical Nairobi slum, with a
   particular focus on provision and quality of paid childcare. Through
   this, to inform evaluation of quality and design and implementation of
   interventions with the potential to reach some of the most vulnerable
   children at the most critical time in the life course.Methods and
   analysisMixed methods will be employed. Qualitative research (in-depth
   interviews and focus group discussions) with parents/carers will explore
   need for and decision-making about childcare. A household survey (of 480
   households) will estimate the use of different childcare strategies by
   parents/carers and associated parent/carer characteristics.
   Subsequently, childcare providers will be mapped and surveyed to
   document and assess quality of current paid childcare. Semistructured
   observations will augment self-reported quality with observable
   characteristics/practices. Finally, in-depth interviews and focus group
   discussions with childcare providers will explore their behaviours and
   motivations. Qualitative data will be analysed through thematic analysis
   and triangulation across methods. Quantitative and spatial data will be
   analysed through epidemiological methods (random effects regression
   modelling and spatial statistics).Ethics and disseminationEthical
   approval has been granted in the UK and Kenya. Findings will be
   disseminated through journal publications, community and government
   stakeholder workshops, policy briefs and social media content.},

   55.53 (SD, 7.3) years. Younger age, having been treated with
   percutaneous coronary intervention, and hypertension predict higher Web
   site logins, whereas higher education, comorbidity with hypertension and
   diabetes, larger family size, and having been treated with percutaneous
   coronary intervention predict higher chatroom engagement. The Web site
   logins, Web site data uploads, chatroom nurse consultation, age, number
   of family members, drinking, and coresidency status were identified as
   significant correlates and explained 41.8\% of the improvement in
   behavior change. This study demonstrated empirical evidence that Web
   site visits, health data uploads, and nurse consultations are crucial
   for behavior modification. Further studies may monitor usage metrics and
   investigate self-reported usage to explore the role of peer interaction
   in modifying behavior. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial

Title = {Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS): protocol for an observational
   case-control study focusing on the patient interval in ovarian cancer
   diagnosis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Introduction Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women
   worldwide, and about 1 in 5 women with ovarian cancer do not receive
   treatment, because they are too unwell by the time they are diagnosed.
   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are non-specific or can be associated with
   other common conditions, and women experiencing these symptoms have been
   shown to self-manage them using over-the-counter medication. Results
   from a recent proof-of-concept study suggest there may be an increase in
   the purchases of painkillers and indigestion medication 10-12 months
   before ovarian cancer diagnosis. We propose a case-control study, as
   part of a larger project called the Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS),
   to investigate whether a significant change in medication purchases
   could be an indication for early signs of ovarian cancer, using data
   already collected through store loyalty cards.
   Methods and analysis Using a retrospective case-control design, we aim
   to recruit 500 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer (cases) and 500 women
   without ovarian cancer (controls) in the UK who hold a loyalty card with
   at least one participating high street retailer. We will use
   pre-existing loyalty card data to compare past purchase patterns of
   cases with those of controls. In order to assess ovarian cancer risk in
   participants and their purchase patterns, we will collect information
   from participants on ovarian cancer risk factors and clinical data
   including symptoms experienced before diagnosis from recruited women
   with ovarian cancer.
   Ethics and dissemination CLOCS was reviewed and approved by the North
   West-Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee (19/NW/0427).
   Study outcomes will be disseminated through academic publications, the
   study website, social media and a report to the research sites that
   support the study once results are published.},

Abstract = {In this ongoing work, we present the Grebe social data aggregation
   framework for extracting geo-fenced Twitter data for analysis of user
   engagement in health and wellness topics. Grebe also provides various
   visualization tools for analyzing temporal and geographical health
   trends. Grebe currently has over 18 million indexed public tweets, and
   is the first of its kind for Canadian researchers. The large dataset is
   used for analyzing three types of contexts: geographical context via
   prediction of user location using supervised learning, topical context
   via determining health-related tweets using various learning approaches,
   and affective context via sentiment analysis of tweets using rule-based
   methods. For the first, we define user location as the position from
   which users are posting a tweet and use standard precision metrics for
   evaluation with promising results for predicting provinces and cities
   from tweet text. For the second, we use a broader definition of health
   using the six dimensions of wellness model and evaluate using manually
   annotated documents with good results using supervised and
   semi-supervised machine learning. For the third, we use the indexed
   tweets to show current trends in emotions and opinions and demonstrate
   trends in polarity and emotions across various Canadian provinces. The
   combination of these contexts provides useful insights for digital
   epidemiology. Ultimately, the vision of Grebe is to provide researchers
   with Canada-specific social web datasets through an open source platform
   with an accessible RESTful API, and this paper showcases Grebe's
   potential and presents our progress towards achieving these goals.},

Title = {Protocol for the development of a reporting guideline for causal and

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction While there are guidelines for reporting on observational
   studies (eg, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
   Epidemiology, Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational
   Routinely Collected Health Data Statement), estimation of causal effects
   from both observational data and randomised experiments (eg, A Guideline
   for Reporting Mediation Analyses of Randomised Trials and Observational
   Studies, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, PATH) and on
   prediction modelling (eg, Transparent Reporting of a multivariable
   prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis), none is
   purposely made for deriving and validating models from observational
   data to predict counterfactuals for individuals on one or more possible
   interventions, on the basis of given (or inferred) causal structures.
   This paper describes methods and processes that will be used to develop
   a Reporting Guideline for Causal and Counterfactual Prediction Models
   (PRECOG). Methods and analysis PRECOG will be developed following
   published guidance from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of
   Health Research (EQUATOR) network and will comprise five stages. Stage 1
   will be meetings of a working group every other week with rotating
   external advisors (active until stage 5). Stage 2 will comprise a
   systematic review of literature on counterfactual prediction modelling
   for biomedical sciences (registered in Prospective Register of
   Systematic Reviews). In stage 3, a computer-based, real-time Delphi
   survey will be performed to consolidate the PRECOG checklist, involving
   experts in causal inference, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning,
   informatics and protocols/standards. Stage 4 will involve the write-up
   of the PRECOG guideline based on the results from the prior stages.
   Stage 5 will seek the peer-reviewed publication of the guideline, the
   scoping/systematic review and dissemination. Ethics and dissemination
   The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
   study has been registered in EQUATOR and approved by the University of
   Florida's Institutional Review Board (\#202200495). Informed consent
   will be obtained from the working groups and the Delphi survey
   participants. The dissemination of PRECOG and its products will be done
   through journal publications, conferences, websites and social media.},

Abstract = {In light of current trends in virology, we performed social media
   analysis of 13 main topics in the area of virology and ranked these
   topics with metrics such as users, posts, engagement, and influence.
   These metrics were monitored against the 13 keywords on Twitter for the
   same period (i.e., from 27 November to 6 December 2021) for benchmarking
   purposes. The 13 main topics were ``virological Science{''}, ``
   preventive vaccines{''}, ``therapeutic vaccines{''}, ``viral
   pathogenesis{''}, ``viral immunology{''}, ``antiviral strategies{''},
   ``virus structure{''}, ``virus expression{''}, ``viral resistance{''},
   ``emerging viruses{''}, ``interspecies transmission{''}, ``viruses and
   cancer{''} and `` viral diseases{''}. ``viral diseases{''} recorded the
   highest number of users (i.e., 905 users) and the highest number of post
   (i.e., about 1K posts). The second-highest number of posts were
   monitored to be on ``therapeutic vaccines{''} with 729 posts from 691
   users. In terms of engagement, ``viral diseases{''} (3.4 K) were found
   to be on the top followed by ``viruses and cancer{''} (3.1K). Lastly, in
   terms of influence, ``viral diseases{''} recorded 9.0 million influences
   followed by 6.6 million influences on ``emerging viruses{''}. In
   summary, ``viral diseases{''} was found to be the most engaging and
   influential topic highest with the highest number of posts from most of
   the tweet users. In relation to trending hashtags in virology, \#COVID19
   recorded the highest number of hashtags, followed by \# omicron,
   \#sarscov2, \#publichealth, \#omicronvarient, \#wuhan, \#originofcovid,
   \#fauci and \#epidemiology. Word clouds showing the main area of
   discussion were also generated for these 13 main topics.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to describe intimate partner violence
   (IPV) severity and types of victimization during the early states of the
   COVID19 pandemic. A survey was distributed through social media and
   email distribution lists. The survey was open for 14 days in April 2020
   and 2441 participated. Information on IPV, COVID19-related IPV severity,
   sociodemographics, and COVID19-related behaviors (eg, job loss) were
   collected. Regression models were used to evaluate COVID19-related IPV
   severity across victimization types and sociodemographics. 18\% screened
   positive for IPV. Among the respondents that screened positive, 54\%
   stated the victimization remained the same since the COVID19 outbreak,
   while 17\% stated it worsened and 30\% stated it got better. The odds of
   worsening victimization during the pandemic was significantly higher
   among physical and sexual violence. While the majority of IPV
   participants reported victimization to remain the same, sexual and
   physical violence was exacerbated during the early stages of the
   pandemic. Addressing victimization during the pandemic (and beyond) must
   be multi-sectorial.},

Abstract = {We study the problems of finding a subset of nodes having a given size k
   and satisfying one of the following separation properties: The set is
   disconnected from the rest of the graph by a small/large cut or by a
   small separator. The considered problems are of interest in several
   practical settings, such as epidemiology or disaster control as well as
   to contrast viruses, malware, or misinformation propagate quickly in
   online social networks. All the considered problems are known to be
   NP-hard. Being computation time for very large networks is an important
   issue, we consider some parameters of the input graph G and show that
   the problems become tractable for small values of such parameters.
   Namely, we show that they become tractable when parameterized either by
   the neighborhood diversity or by the treewidth of G. We also consider

Abstract = {The rapid and wide-reaching expansion of internet access and digital
   technologies offers epidemiologists numerous opportunities to study
   health behaviors. One particularly promising new data collection
   strategy is the use of Facebook's advertising platform in conjunction
   with Web-based surveys. Our research team at the Center for Technology
   and Behavioral Health has used this quick and cost-efficient method to
   recruit large samples and address unique scientific questions related to
   cannabis use. In conducting this research, we have gleaned several
   insights for using this sampling method effectively and have begun to
   document the characteristics of the resulting data. We believe this
   information could be useful to other researchers attempting to study
   cannabis use or, potentially, other health behaviors. The first aim of
   this paper is to describe case examples of procedures for using Facebook
   as a survey sampling method for studying cannabis use. We then present
   several distinctive features of the data produced using this method.
   Finally, we discuss the utility of this sampling method for addressing
   specific types of epidemiological research questions. Overall, we
   believe that sampling with Facebook advertisements and Web surveys is
   best conceptualized as a targeted, nonprobability-based method for
   oversampling cannabis users across the United States.},

Title = {Stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers facing COVID-19
   pandemic in Egypt: a cross-sectional online-based study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective
   This study assessed perceived stress, anxiety and depression among
   healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt.
   Setting
   This was an online study where a Google form was prepared including
   sociodemographic and occupational data as well as three validated
   questionnaires to assess perceived stress, anxiety and depression,
   respectively. The form was distributed online to all social media groups
   including healthcare workers all across the country, and responses were
   collected until the sample size of 262.
   Participants
   Healthcare workers (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists,
   nurses, technicians and administrators) working in governmental or
   educational hospitals from all Egyptian governorates who are members of
   social media groups. The mean age of participants was 33.4 +/- 5.9
   years, 70\% were women, about 70\% were married and 66\% were
   physicians.
   Outcomes
   The frequency of perceived stress, anxiety and depression observed among
   the study participants according to the results of their questionnaires.
   Then the frequencies were compared between different sociodemographic
   characteristics.
   Results
   Only 1.3\% showed low perceived stress while 98.5\% showed moderate to
   severe stress. About 9.5\% did not experience generalised anxiety, while
   the remaining 90.5\% had different degrees of anxiety as mild anxiety
   showed the highest per cent affecting about 40\% of participants
   followed by moderate anxiety about 32\% then severe anxiety, 18.5\%.
   With regard to depression, 94\% of participants showed mild to severe
   depression.
   Conclusion
   This study showed a high prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety and
   depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic that
   affected all workers regardless of different sociodemographic
   characteristics.},

Title = {Injuries and Use of Safety Equipment in River Surfing},
Journal = {ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background:River surfing (also called ``rapid surfing{''}) involves
   surfing on stationary waves that are artificially created or placed in
   rivers and is gaining popularity, especially among surfers in landlocked
   areas but also among athletes without experience in ocean surfing.
   Different wave setups, types of boards, and types of fins, as well as
   the use of safety equipment, can lead to overuse and injuries.
   Purpose:To analyze the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors of river
   surfing-related injuries for different types of waves and to evaluate
   the usage and appropriateness of safety equipment. Study
   Design:Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:An online survey was
   distributed via social media to river surfers in German-speaking
   countries to collect information on demographics, injury history for the
   previous 12 months, wave site attended, use of (safety) equipment, and
   health issues. The survey was accessible between November 2021 and
   February 2022. Results:A total of 213 participants completed the survey:
   195 participants from Germany, 10 from Austria, 6 from Switzerland, and
   2 from other countries. The mean age was 36 years (range, 11-73 years),
   72\% (n = 153) were male, and 10\% (n = 22) took part in competitions.
   Overall, 60\% (n = 128) of surfers experienced 741 surfing-related
   injuries over the previous 12 months. The most common mechanisms of
   injury were contact with the bottom of the pool/river (n = 75 {[}35\%]),
   with the board (n = 65 {[}30\%]), and with the fins (n = 57 {[}27\%]).
   The most frequent injury types were contusions/bruises (n = 256),
   cuts/lacerations (n = 159), abrasions (n = 152), and overuse (n = 58).
   Injuries affected mainly the feet/toes (n = 90), head/face (n = 67),
   hand/fingers (n = 51), knee (n = 49), lower back (n = 49), and thighs (n
   = 45). Earplugs were used by 50 (24\%) participants, and a helmet was
   used regularly by 38 (18\%) participants and never by 175 (82\%)
   participants. Conclusion:The most frequent types of injury in river
   surfers were contusions/bruises, cuts/lacerations, and abrasions. The
   main mechanisms of injury were contact with the bottom of the
   pool/river, with the board, or with the fins. The feet/toes were more
   prone to injuries, followed by the head/face and hand/fingers.},

Abstract = {Purpose Previous research on associations between screen media use and
   mental health produced mixed findings, possibly because studies have not
   examined screen activities separately or accounted for gender
   differences. We sought to examine associations between different types
   of screen activities (social media, internet, gaming, and TV) and mental
   health indicators separately for boys and girls. Methods We drew from a
   nationally representative sample of 13-15-year-old adolescents in the UK
   (n = 11,427) asking about hours per day spent on specific screen media
   activities and four mental health indicators: self-harm behavior,
   depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. Results Hours
   spent on social media and Internet use were more strongly associated
   with self-harm behaviors, depressive symptoms, low life satisfaction,
   and low self-esteem than hours spent on electronic gaming and TV
   watching. Girls generally demonstrated stronger associations between
   screen media time and mental health indicators than boys (e.g., heavy
   Internet users were 166\% more likely to have clinically relevant levels
   of depressive symptoms than low users among girls, compared to 75\% more
   likely among boys). Conclusion Thus, not all screen time is created
   equal; social media and Internet use among adolescent girls are the most
   strongly associated with compromised mental health. Future research
   should examine different screen media activities and boys and girls
   separately where possible. Practitioners should be aware that some types
   of screen time are more likely to be linked to mental health issues than
   others.},

Title = {The anatomy of COVID-19 comorbidity networks among hospitalized Korean
   patients},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine how comorbidities were associated with
   outcomes (illness severity or death) among hospitalized patients with
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   METHODS: Data were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea
   Disease Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical
   and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with
   COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in Korea. We
   conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression
   analyses to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease
   severity and mortality. The outcome variable was the clinical severity
   score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen treatment not needed), severe
   (oxygen treatment needed), or death.
   RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted
   model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.58; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95\% CI, 1.35 to 7.52) were
   significantly associated with disease severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95\% CI,
   2.00 to 14.31), heart failure (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95\% CI, 1.22 to 8.15),
   malignancy (OR, 3.38; 95\% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95\%
   CI, 1.45 to 4.72), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.26; 95\% CI, 1.46 to
   3.49) were associated with an increased risk of death. Asthma and
   hypertension showed statistically insignificant associations with an
   increased risk of death.
   CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases contribute differently to the severity
   of COVID-19. To efficiently allocate limited medical resources,
   underlying comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly CKD,
   COPD, and HF.},

Title = {CECM: A cognitive emotional contagion model in social networks},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Social networks have changed the way how people communicate with each
   other dramatically. The study on information dissemination in social
   networks has attracted considerable attention. Many evidences show that
   emotionsof netizens are likely to spread with information and the
   emotional contagion also affect information dissemination in social
   networks. In this paper, we propose a cognitive emotional contagion
   model (CECM) which combines the model of individual characteristics, the
   topology of a social network, and the changing process as well as
   evolution of emotion contagion. Distinguished from conventional
   epidemiology-based models, our CECM model not only considers the changes
   of individuals' emotional statuses but also the influence of individuals
   to others during the information dissemination in a social network.
   Specifically, CECM first models an individual's emotions as emotional
   attributes and emotional statuses. Using Emotional statuses, we define
   the process of an individual's emotional change, which could be affected
   by one's emotional attributes (e.g. personality). CECM also models the
   network-wise features of an individual, including one's authority and
   the connection strength to one's neighbors in a social network. Finally,
   given emotional models and network-wise features of all users in a
   social network, a series of transition probabilities among the user's
   emotional status are defined to model the emotional evolution. A series
   of simulations is conducted to observe the characteristics of the
   proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can
   reflect the real-world situation of emotional contagion for different
   distributions of personality factors.},

Title = {A bibliometric analysis of the theme trends and knowledge structures of
   pulmonary embolism from 2017 to 2021},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundPulmonary embolism (PE) is a popular area of research in the
   field of respiratory medicine. We performed a bibliometric analysis
   based on PubMed database to characterize the distribution pattern of
   literature and knowledge structures related to PE. MethodsLiterature
   pertaining to PE from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, was
   retrieved from the PubMed database. Bibliographic information was
   generated using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder
   (BICOMB). The visualization matrix was established using gCLUTO
   software. Strategic diagram analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
   9 software. Social network analysis (SNA) was generated using Ucinet6.0
   and NetDraw 2.084 software. ResultsOut of all the retrieved MeSH terms
   and subheadings, 52 MeSH terms/MeSH subheadings with a high frequency
   were found, and hot subjects were sorted into 6 clusters. The strategy
   diagram showed that the epidemiology, etiology, and drug therapy of PE
   were well advanced. In contrast, studies on diagnostic imaging,
   pathology, and complications of PE were still immature and offered
   potential research space. Social network analysis showed that marginal
   topics such as surgical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, prevention
   and control of postoperative complications, and metabolism and analysis
   of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were emerging research
   hotspots. ConclusionObjective analysis of the research developments in
   the field of PE can provide intuitive knowledge structure for
   researchers and clinicians. Analysis of the research hotspots related to
   PE is helpful for researchers and clinicians by highlighting future
   research directions.},

Abstract = {Social network analysis is an invaluable tool to understand the
   patterns, evolution, and consequences of sociality. Comparative studies
   over a range of social systems across multiple taxonomic groups are
   particularly valuable. Such studies however require quantitative social
   association or interaction data across multiple species which is not
   easily available. We introduce the Animal Social Network Repository
   (ASNR) as the first multi-taxonomic repository that collates 790 social
   networks from more than 45 species, including those of mammals,
   reptiles, fish, birds, and insects. The repository was created by
   consolidating social network datasets from the literature on wild and
   captive animals into a consistent and easy-to-use network data format.
   The repository is archived at https://bansallab.github.io/asnr/. ASNR
   has tremendous research potential, including testing hypotheses in the
   fields of animal ecology, social behavior, epidemiology and evolutionary
   biology.},

Abstract = {Geographical propagation phenomena occur in multiple domains, such as in

   and visualizations play a key role in helping subject-matter experts
   understand and analyze them. However, there is little empirical data
   about the effectiveness of the various strategies used to visualize
   geographical propagation. To fill this gap, we conduct an experiment to
   evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies: an animated map,
   small-multiple maps, and a single map with glyphs. We compare them under
   five tasks that vary in one of the following dimensions: propagation
   scope, direction, speed, peaks, and spatial jumps. Our results show that
   small-multiple maps perform best overall, but that the effectiveness of
   each visualization varies depending on the task considered.},

Title = {Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction
   model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the
   Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both
   published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction
   model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the
   processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the
   TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST
   (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine
   learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will
   be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and
   will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews
   (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the
   quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction
   model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key
   stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered
   for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual
   consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be
   included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing
   the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the
   accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage,
   stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals,
   conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR
   Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on
   prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting
   guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to
   evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially
   reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers,
   clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise
   the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction
   model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the
   Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford on
   10-December-2020 (R73034/RE001). Findings from this study will be
   disseminated through peer-review publications. PROSPERO registration

Abstract = {This manuscript brings attention to inaccurate epidemiological concepts
   that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. In social media and
   scientific journals, some wrong references were given to a ``normal
   epidemic curve{''} and also to a ``log-normal curve/distribution{''}.
   For many years, textbooks and courses of reputable institutions and
   scientific journals have disseminated misleading concepts. For example,
   calling histogram to plots of epidemic curves or using epidemic data to
   introduce the concept of a Gaussian distribution, ignoring its temporal
   indexing. Although an epidemic curve may look like a Gaussian curve and
   be eventually modelled by a Gauss function, it is not a normal
   distribution or a log-normal, as some authors claim. A pandemic produces
   highly-complex data and to tackle it effectively statistical and
   mathematical modelling need to go beyond the ``onesize-fits-all
   solution{''}. Classical textbooks need to be updated since pandemics
   happen and epidemiology needs to provide reliable information to policy
   recommendations and actions. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Atlantis

Title = {Integration of Rehabilitation Activities Into Everyday Life Through
   Telerehabilitation: Qualitative Study of Cardiac Patients and Their
   Partners},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation of cardiac rehabilitation has not been
   optimal, with patient participation rates below 50\%. Factors that
   contribute to cardiac patients' lack of participation in rehabilitation
   programs are patient motivation, logistical difficulties in getting to
   the rehabilitation facilities, lack of psychosocial elements, and
   individualization of activities in the rehabilitation programs.
   Telerehabilitation has been proposed as a new way to address the
   challenge of engaging and motivating cardiac patients and their partners
   to participate in rehabilitation.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of
   cardiac patients and their partners of participating in the Teledialog
   Telerehabilitation Program (TTP). The Teledialog program consisted of a
   digital rehabilitation plan, transmission of health data from patient's
   home to hospital and health care center, and an interactive Web portal
   with information and training videos.
   Methods: This case study used a theoretical approach combining the
   ``community of practice{''} approach and self-determination theory. A
   triangulation of data collection techniques was used, including
   documents, participant observation (72 hours), and qualitative
   interviews with cardiac patients and their partners enrolled in the
   telerehabilitation group. A total of 14 cardiac patients, 12 patient
   spouses/partners, and 1 son participated in the study. The participants
   were interviewed at enrollment in the telerehabilitation program and
   after 12 weeks of participation in the program. Interview data were
   analyzed using NVivo 11.0.
   Results: Patients and their partners found the Web portal ActiveHeart.dk
   and the electronic rehabilitation (e-rehabilitation) plan to be helpful
   tools for health education, coordinating rehabilitation goals, creating
   an overview of the data, and ensuring continuity in the rehabilitation
   process. The patients felt that the TTP treated them as individuals,
   gave them a sense of autonomy, and provided enhanced relatedness to
   health care professionals and partners and a sense of competence as
   active participants in their own rehabilitation process. Some patients
   missed being part of a community of practice with other cardiac patients
   and did not use the Web forum. Patients' partners found that the
   telerehabilitation program gave them a sense of security and helped them
   balance their involvement as a partner to the patient and not push the
   patient too hard.
   Conclusions: Cardiac patients and their partners found
   telerehabilitation technologies a useful digital toolbox in the
   rehabilitation process. Telerehabilitation motivated the patients to
   integrate rehabilitation activities into their work schedule and
   everyday life and made them feel like unique individuals. Participating
   in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program might not be a suitable
   strategy for all cardiac patients. Being a patient's partner in the
   telerehabilitation program was associated with a heightened sense of
   security, navigation between active involvement in the rehabilitation

Title = {Toward Using Twitter for Tracking COVID-19: A Natural Language
   Processing Pipeline and Exploratory Data Set},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background: In the United States, the rapidly evolving COVID-19
   outbreak, the shortage of available testing, and the delay of test
   results present challenges for actively monitoring its spread based on
   testing alone.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to develop, evaluate, and
   deploy an automatic natural language processing pipeline to collect
   user-generated Twitter data as a complementary resource for identifying
   potential cases of COVID-19 in the United States that are not based on
   testing and, thus, may not have been reported to the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention.
   Methods: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from
   the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention
   keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions
   to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed
   to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out ``reported speech{''} (eg,
   quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular
   expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets
   that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing
   tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do
   not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural
   network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from
   transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more
   than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected
   between March 1 and August 21, 2020.
   Results: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644
   (41\%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen kappa). A deep neural network
   classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related
   to COVID-19, achieved an F-1-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76)
   for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19. Upon
   deploying our automatic pipeline, we identified 13,714 tweets that
   self-report potential cases of COVID-19 and have US state-level
   geolocations.
   Conclusions: We have made the 13,714 tweets identified in this study,
   along with each tweet's time stamp and US state-level geolocation,
   publicly available to download. This data set presents the opportunity
   for future work to assess the utility of Twitter data as a complementary
   resource for tracking the spread of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Throughout much of the 20th century, psychologists have largely examined
   mnemonic processes through an individualistic lens at the expense of
   social influences. However, this perspective began to change toward the
   end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, when
   psychologists began to better appreciate the social nature of
   remembering. In the present paper, we focus on a relatively recent and
   important evolution of this line of research: the emergence of a
   psychological approach to collective memory. Using an epidemiological
   approach to collective memory, we attempt to distil the extant and
   relevant psychological research and focus on how (collective) memories
   transmit, converge, and remain stable over time while considering the
   bidirectional relationship between collective memory and a mnemonic
   community's identity. We conclude with a discussion of research areas
   that psychologists should examine moving forward, which will ultimately
   provide a more holistic understanding of how collective memories emerge,
   remain stable, and/or change over time.},

Abstract = {Introduction Despite the increase in the survival rate of high-risk
   infants (HRIs) worldwide, the prevalence of motor and neurodevelopmental
   sequelae in such newborns has not shown concomitant improvement.
   Meanwhile, there are few cohorts that explore factors related to the
   development of HRIs in China. Therefore, the Guangzhou High-Risk Infant
   Cohort (GHRIC) has been designed to examine the complex relationships
   among a myriad of factors influencing growth and development in such
   children. Methods and analysis The GHRIC study is a prospective cohort
   study that by the year 2023 will enrol an estimated total of 3000 HRIs
   from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (GWCMC) in Guangzhou,
   China. This study is designed to assess the growth and cognitive
   characteristics of HRIs and the risk factors affecting their development
   and prognoses. Data on risk factors, neurodevelopmental and
   cognitive-function evaluations, laboratory results, and specimens will
   be collected and analysed. Information on perinatal and clinical
   interventions for these infants will also be recorded during regular
   follow-up visits until age 6. Ethics and dissemination The protocol for
   this study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of GWCMC,
   which accepted responsibility for supervising all of the aspects of the
   study (No. 2017102712). Study outcomes will be disseminated through

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Cell phone use while driving (CPWD) increases the risk of crashing and
   is a major contributor to injuries and deaths. The objective of this
   study was to describe the evaluation of a multifaceted, evidence-based
   population health strategy for the reduction of distracted driving.
   METHODS
   A multipronged campaign was undertaken from 2014 to 2016 for 16- to
   44-year-olds, based on epidemiology, focused on personal stories and
   consequences, using the ``Es{''} of injury prevention (epidemiology,
   education, environment, enforcement, and evaluation). Education
   consisted of distracted driving videos, informational cards, a social
   media AdTube campaign, and a movie theater trailer, which were evaluated
   with a questionnaire regarding CPWD attitudes, opinions, and behaviors.
   Spatial analysis of data within a geographic information system was used
   to target advertisements. A random sample telephone survey evaluated
   public awareness of the campaign. Increased CPWD enforcement was
   undertaken by police services and evaluated by ARIMA time series
   modeling. RESULTS
   The AdTube campaign had a view rate of >10\% (41,101 views), slightly
   higher for females. The top performing age group was 18- to 24-year-olds
   (49\%). Our survey found 61\% of respondents used handheld CPWD (14\%
   all of the time) with 80\% reporting our movie trailer made them think
   twice about future CPWD. A stakeholder survey and spatial analysis
   targeted our advertisements in areas of close proximity to high schools,
   universities, near intersections with previous motor vehicle collisions,
   high traffic volumes, and population density. A telephone survey
   revealed that 41\% of the respondents were aware of our campaign, 17\%
   from our print and movie theater ads and 3\% from social media. Police
   enforcement campaign blitzes resulted in 160 tickets for CPWD. Following
   campaign implementation, there was a statistically significant mean
   decrease of 462 distracted driving citations annually (p = 0.001).
   CONCLUSION
   A multifaceted, evidence-based population health strategy using the Es
   of injury prevention with interdisciplinary collaboration is a
   comprehensive method to be used for the reduction of distracted driving.},

Abstract = {Introduction Brazil's Bolsa Familia Program (BFP) is the world's largest
   conditional cash transfer scheme. We shall use a large cohort of
   applicants for different social programmes to evaluate the effect of BFP
   receipt on premature all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Methods and
   analysis We will identify BFP recipients and non-recipients among new
   applicants from 2004 to 2015 in the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort, a
   database of 114 million individuals containing sociodemographic and
   mortality information of applicants to any Brazilian social programme.
   For individuals applying from 2011, when we have better recorded income
   data, we shall compare premature (age 30-69) cardiovascular and
   all-cause mortality among BFP recipients and non-recipients using
   regression discontinuity design (RDD) with household monthly per capita
   income as the forcing variable. Effects will be estimated using survival
   models accounting for individuals follow-up. To test the sensitivity of
   our findings, we will estimate models with different bandwidths, include
   potential confounders as covariates in the survival models, and restrict
   our data to locations with the most reliable data. In addition, we will
   estimate the effect of BFP on studied outcomes using propensity score
   risk-set matching, separately for individuals that applied <= 2010 and
   >2011, allowing comparability with RDD. Analyses will be stratified by
   geographical region, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position.
   We will investigate differential impacts of BFP and the presence of
   effect modification for a combination of characteristics, including
   gender and race/ethnicity. Ethics and dissemination The study was
   approved by the ethics committees of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the
   University of Glasgow College of Medicine and Veterinary Life Sciences.
   The deidentified dataset will be provided to researchers, and data
   analysis will be performed in a safe computational environment without
   internet access. Study findings will be published in high quality
   peer-reviewed research articles. The published results will be
   disseminated in the social media and to policy-makers.},

Abstract = {Upper limb disorders (affecting the hand, arm and neck) are common. The
   nature of anaesthetists' work poses a potential extra risk from poor
   posture that may contribute to the development of upper limb disorders
   in this professional group. However, to date, the problem has received
   scant attention in the literature. Following a 2 to 3-month period of
   publicity via newsletter, email and social media, all 10,231
   electronically accessible members of the Association of Anaesthetists
   were invited by email to complete an online survey that was administered
   by a third-party company. A total of 3884 usable responses were received
   (38\%). Analysis of possible risk factors found a significant
   association between upper limb disorders and years since starting
   anaesthetic training, having children (irrespective of respondents' sex
   or the number of children) and right-handedness. Years of practice and
   having children are less modifiable identified risk factors. However,
   right-handedness may be linked to the ergonomic design of the
   environment/equipment used within this specialty and may thus be a
   potentially modifiable risk factor worthy of further investigation.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate content quality and
   racial/ethnic representation, particularly of high-risk cohorts, of
   prostate cancer screening videos on YouTube (YT) and TikTok
   (TK).Materials and methods: The top 50 videos populated for the search
   term `prostate cancer screening' on YT and TK that met inclusion
   criteria were retrieved in a cache-cleared browser. Three reviewers
   analysed all videos using validated criteria for the quality of consumer
   health information (DISCERN and Patient Education Materials Assessment
   Tool {[}PEMAT]). High quality was defined as follows: DISCERN >= 4,
   PEMAT understandability >= 75\% and PEMAT actionability >= 75\%. A
   5-point Likert scale was used to demonstrate the level of misinformation
   compared to American Urological Association and National Comprehensive
   Cancer Network guidelines. Perceived race and ethnicity of people in the
   videos were assessed by consensus approach.Results: TK videos were
   shorter (median 3.7 vs. 0.5 min, p < 0.001) and had more views per month
   (5437.5 vs. 19.3, p = 0.03) than YT videos. Perceived Black and Hispanic
   representation was present in 10\% and 6\% of YT videos and 20\% and
   12\% of TK videos, respectively. High-risk racial/ethnic groups were
   explicitly discussed in 46\% of YT videos and 8\% of TK videos. A total
   of 98\% of YT videos and 100\% of TK videos had low- to moderate-quality
   consumer health information, and 88\% of YT videos and 100\% of TK
   videos had moderate to high levels of misinformation based on screening
   guidelines.Conclusions: YT and TK videos about prostate cancer screening
   are widely viewed but do not provide quality consumer health
   information. Black and Hispanic men remain under-represented on both
   platforms, and high-risk racial groups were not discussed in most videos
   despite the importance for screening criteria. The low understandability
   and actionability, significant misinformation and lack of diversity in
   online videos support the need for higher quality videos with adequate
   attention to high-risk ethnic cohorts.},

Abstract = {The paper describes knowledge base principles and method for disease
   risk evaluation that were used for intelligent healthcare management
   system creation. The present version of the knowledge base is
   implemented using a heterogeneous semantic network approach and utilizes
   expert opinions about risk factors and events influencing an
   individual's health. Data includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle,
   and external environment. Data is compiled with the aid of
   questionnaires, mobile devices, case histories and information from
   social media. Information from social media is analyzed using data and
   text mining methods with the goal of evaluating the user's condition.
   All of the data obtained is accumulated in a single database. The method
   for risk evaluation and preventive measures plan hypotheses generation
   is based on an argumentation reasoning algorithm that is modified to the
   task at hand. All prevention recommendations are based on the principles
   of P4 medicine. The current version of the system is based on expert
   knowledge obtained by automated monitoring and analysis of a large
   number of publications and recommendations on this topic.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Multimorbidity can be defined as the presence of two or more chronic
   diseases in an individual. This condition is associated with reduced
   quality of life, increased disability, greater functional impairment,
   increased health care utilisation, greater fragmentation of care and
   complexity of treatment, and increased mortality. Thus, understanding
   its epidemiology and inherent complexity is essential to improve the
   quality of life of patients and to reduce the costs associated with
   multi-pathology. In this paper, using data from the European Health
   Survey, we explore the application of Mixed Graphical Models and its
   combination with social network analysis techniques for the discovery
   and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns. The results
   obtained show the usefulness and versatility of this approach for the
   study of multimorbidity based on the use of graphs, which offer the
   researcher a holistic view of the relational structure of data with
   variables of different types and high dimensionality.},

Title = {Digital Global Recruitment for Women's Health Research: Cross-sectional
   Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: With the increased popularity of mobile menstrual tracking
   apps and boosted Facebook posts, there is a unique opportunity to
   recruit research study participants from across the globe via these
   modalities to evaluate women's health. However, no studies to date have
   assessed the feasibility of using these recruitment sources for
   epidemiological research on ovulation and menstruation.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of
   recruiting a diverse sample of women to an epidemiological study of
   ovulation and menstruation (OM) health (OM Global Health Study) using
   digital recruitment sources. The feasibility and diversity were assessed
   via click and participation rates, geographic location, BMI, smoking
   status, and other demographic information.
   Methods: Participants were actively recruited via in-app messages using
   the menstrual tracking app Clue (BioWink GmbH) and a boosted Facebook
   post by DivaCup (Diva International Inc.). Other passive recruitment
   methods also took place throughout the recruitment period (eg, email
   communications, blogs, other social media). The proportion of
   participants who visited the study website after viewing and clicking
   the hypertext link (click rates) in the in-app messages and boosted
   Facebook post and the proportion of participants who completed the
   surveys per the number of completed consent and eligibility screeners
   (participation rates) were used to quantify the success of recruiting
   participants to the study website and study survey completion,
   respectively. Survey completion was defined as finishing the pregnancy
   and birth history section of the OM Global Health Study questionnaire.
   Results: The recruitment period was from February 27, 2018, through
   January 24, 2020. In-app messages and the boosted Facebook post were
   seen by 104,000 and 21,400 people, respectively. Overall, 215
   participants started the OM Global Health Study survey, of which 140
   (65.1\%), 39 (18.1\%), and 36 (16.8\%) participants were recruited via
   the app, the boosted Facebook post, and other passive recruitment
   methods, respectively. The click rate via the app was 18.9\% (19,700
   clicks/104,000 ad views) and 1.6\% via the boosted Facebook post (340
   clicks/21,400 ad views.) The overall participation rate was 44.6\%
   (198/444), and the average participant age was 21.8 (SD 6.1) years. In
   terms of geographic and racial/ethnic diversity, 91 (44.2\%) of the
   participants resided outside the United States and 147 (70.7\%)
   identified as non-Hispanic White. In-app recruitment produced the most
   geographically diverse stream, with 44 (32.8\%) of the 134 participants
   in Europe, 77 (57.5\%) in North America, and 13 (9.8\%) in other parts
   of the world. Both human error and nonhuman procedural breakdowns
   occurred during the recruitment process, including a computer
   programming error related to age eligibility and a hacking attempt by an
   internet bot.
   Conclusions: In-app messages using the menstrual tracking app Clue were
   the most successful method for recruiting participants from many
   geographic regions and producing the greatest numbers of started and
   completed surveys. This study demonstrates the utility of digital
   recruitment to enroll participants from diverse geographic locations and
   provides some lessons to avoid technical recruitment errors in future
   digital recruitment strategies for epidemiological research.},

Abstract = {One cannot spend >5 min on social media at the moment without finding a
   link to some conspiracy theory or other regarding the origin of
   SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. From
   the virus being deliberately released as a bioweapon to pharmaceutical
   companies blocking the trials of natural remedies to boost their
   dangerous drugs and vaccines, the Internet is rife with far-fetched
   rumors. And predictably, now that the first immunization trials have
   started, the antivaccine lobby has latched on to most of them. In the
   last week, the trailer for a new ``bombshell documentary{''} Plandemic
   has been doing the rounds, gaining notoriety for being repeatedly
   removed from YouTube and Facebook. We usually would not pay much heed to
   such things, but for retrovirologists like us, the name associated with
   these claims is unfortunately too familiar: Dr. Judy Mikovits.},

Abstract = {Peer-reviewed journals provide an invaluable but inadequate vehicle for
   scientific communication. Preprints are now an essential complement to
   peer-reviewed publications. Eschewing preprints will slow scientific
   progress and reduce the public health impact of epidemiologic research.
   The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted
   long-standing limitations of the peer-review process. Preprint servers,
   such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, served as crucial venues to rapidly
   disseminate research and provide detailed backup to sound-bite science
   that is often communicated through the popular press or social media.
   The major criticisms of preprints arise from an unjustified optimism
   about peer review. Peer review provides highly imperfect sorting and
   curation of research and only modest improvements in research conduct or
   presentation for most individual papers. The advantages of peer review
   come at the expense of months to years of delay in sharing research
   methods or results. For time-sensitive evidence, these delays can lead
   to important missteps and ill-advised policies. Even with research that
   is not intrinsically urgent, preprints expedite debate, expand
   engagement, and accelerate progress. The risk that poor-quality papers
   will have undue influence because they are posted on a preprint server
   is low. If epidemiology aims to deliver evidence relevant for public
   health, we need to embrace strategic uses of preprint servers.},

Abstract = {Objectives This contribution provides insights into the methodology of a
   pan-European population-based online survey, performed without external
   funding during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the impact of different
   dissemination strategies to collect data from a non-probabilistic
   convenience sample and outline post-stratification weighting schemes, to
   provide guidance for future multi-country survey studies.
   Methods Description and comparison of dissemination strategies for five
   exemplary countries (Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Spain)
   participating in the Alcohol Use and COVID-19 Survey. Comparison of the
   sample distribution with the country's actual population distribution
   according to sociodemographics, and development of weighting schemes.
   Results The dissemination of online surveys through national newspapers,
   paid social media adverts and dissemination with the support of national
   health ministries turned out to be the most effective strategies.
   Monitoring the responses and adapting dissemination strategies to reach
   under-represented groups, and the application of sample weights were
   helpful to achieve an analytic sample matching the respective general
   population profiles.
   Conclusion Reaching a large pan-European convenience sample, including
   most European countries, in a short time was feasible, with the support
   of a broad scientific network.},

Title = {Predictors of outcome in sciatica patients following an epidural steroid

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {IntroductionSciatica can be very painful and, in most cases, is due to
   pressure on a spinal nerve root from a disc herniation with associated
   inflammation. For some patients, the pain persists, and one management
   option is a spinal epidural steroid injection (ESI). The aim of an ESI
   is to relieve leg pain, improve function and reduce the need for
   surgery. ESIs work well in some patients but not in others, but we
   cannot identify these patient subgroups currently. This study aims to
   identify factors, including patient characteristics, clinical
   examination and imaging findings, that help in predicting who does well
   and who does not after an ESI. The overall objective is to develop a
   prognostic model to support individualised patient and clinical
   decision-making regarding ESI.MethodsPOiSE is a prospective cohort study
   of 439 patients with sciatica referred by their clinician for an ESI.
   Participants will receive weekly text messages until 12 weeks following
   their ESIand then again at 24 weeks following their ESI to collect data
   on leg pain severity. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at
   baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after their ESI to collect data on pain,
   disability, recovery and additional interventions. The prognosis for the
   cohort will be described. The primary outcome measure for the prognostic
   model is leg pain at 6 weeks. Prognostic models will also be developed
   for secondary outcomes of disability and recovery at 6 weeks and
   additional interventions at 24 weeks following ESI. Statistical analyses
   will include multivariable linear and logistic regression with mixed
   effects model.Ethics and disseminationThe POiSE study has received
   ethical approval (South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee
   21/SC/0257). Dissemination will be guided by our patient and public
   engagement group and will include scientific publications, conference
   presentations and social media.},

Abstract = {Spatial data volumes have grown exponentially over the past several
   years. The number of domains that spatial data are extensively leveraged
   include atmospheric sciences, environmental monitoring, ecological
   modeling, epidemiology, sociology, commerce, and social media among
   others. These data are often used to understand phenomena and inform
   decision-making by fitting models to them. In this study, we present our
   methodology to fit models at scale over spatial data. Our methodology
   encompasses segmentation, spatial similarity based on the dataset(s)
   under consideration, and transfer learning schemes that are informed by
   the spatial similarity to train models faster while utilizing fewer
   resources. We consider several model fitting algorithms and execution
   within containerized environments as we profile the suitability of our
   methodology. Our benchmarks validate the suitability of our methodology
   to facilitate faster, resource-efficient training of models over spatial
   data.},

Title = {The role of weight- and appearance-related discrimination on eating
   disorder symptoms among adolescents and emerging adults},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background Eating disorder symptoms (EDs) have been discussed as a
   prominent problem among late adolescent girls with serious health risks
   and long-term consequences. However, there is a lack of population-based
   evidence on EDs comprising the age range from early adolescence to
   emerging adulthood as well as considering both females and males
   equally. Additionally, the differential role of a comprehensive set of
   several relevant risk factors and particularly weight- and
   appearance-related discrimination warrants further attention. Thus, we
   aimed to contribute to a better understanding of sex- and age-related
   differences in associations between discrimination experience and other
   relevant personal risk factors (body image, social media use,
   self-efficacy, social support) with EDs. Furthermore, we were interested
   in the exploration of underlying mechanisms enhancing the risk of EDs by
   taking discrimination experience into account. Methods Based on a
   logistic regression model, we investigated associations between weight-
   and appearance-related discrimination and EDs while controlling for
   other relevant personal risk factors in a subsample of N = 8504
   adolescents and emerging adults (54.4\% female, mean age = 20.71 years,
   SD = 4.32 years) drawn from a German representative health survey (KiGGS
   Wave 2). In a second step, we investigated the mediating role of
   discrimination experience between the other risk factors and EDs with
   the help of a path model. Results While controlling for other relevant
   personal risk factors, weight- and appearance-related discrimination was
   significantly related to EDs. Whereas the risk of EDs was significantly
   enhanced in males and emerging adults frequently experiencing
   weight-related discrimination, adolescents showed a higher risk of EDs
   when experiencing appearance-related discrimination. Moreover,
   discrimination experience partly explained the associations between body
   image dissatisfaction, low self-efficacy, high media use and ED
   symptoms. Conclusions The results highlight weight- and
   appearance-related discrimination as one central factor to be considered
   in the pathogeneses of EDs and underpin the need for discrimination
   prevention as well as the promotion of adaptive coping with
   discrimination experience to reduce the risk of developing ED symptoms.
   Males and emerging adults need particular attention when facing
   weight-related discrimination whereas risk constellations and EDs
   particularly affecting females need further investigation.},

Abstract = {Background: As a communications strategy, education entertainment has
   been used to inform, influence, and shift societal and individual
   behaviors. Recently, there has been an increasing number of
   entertainment-education YouTube videos focused on hand hygiene. However,
   there is currently no understanding about the quality of these videos;
   therefore, this study aimed to explore the social media content and user
   engagement with these videos.
   Methods: The search terms ``hand hygiene{''} and ``hand hygiene
   education{''} were used to query YouTube. Video content had to be
   directed at a health care professional audience. Using author designed
   checklists, each video was systematically evaluated and grouped
   according to educational usefulness and was subsequently evaluated
   against the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and
   persuasiveness.
   Results: A total of 400 videos were screened, with 70 videos retained
   for analysis. Of these, 55.7\%(n = 39) were categorized as educationally
   useful. Overall, educationally useful videos scored higher than
   noneducationally useful videos across the categories of attractiveness,
   comprehension, and persuasiveness. Miscommunication of the concept of My
   5 Moments for Hand Hygiene was observed in several of the YouTube
   videos.
   Conclusions: The availability of educationally useful videos in relation
   to hand hygiene is evident; however, it is clear that there are
   opportunities for contributors using this medium to strengthen their
   alignment with social media best practice principles to maximize the
   effectiveness, reach, and sustainability of their content. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate use and misuse of the word
   `schizophrenia' and its derivatives to assess the prevalence of
   stigmatizing and trivializing attitudes and the meanings attributed to
   the condition on Turkish Twitter. Methods Using R programming language,
   we collected Turkish Twitter posts containing the terms used for
   schizophrenia in Turkish through Twitter's Search API over a 47-day
   period between July and June 2019. After removing retweets, we randomly
   sampled 3000 tweets and manually categorized them in three dimensions:
   use type (metaphorical/non-metaphorical), topic and attitude.
   Qualitative analysis on representative tweets were performed and word
   frequencies were calculated. Results In total 44,266 tweets were
   collected and after removing retweets, 24,529 tweets were obtained.
   Overwhelming majority of the tweets (91.7\%) used the terms
   metaphorically and the majority displayed stigmatizing (68.3\%) and
   trivializing (23\%) attitudes. Politics was the most common topic
   (58.2\%) followed by everyday/social chatter (28.5\%). Only a small
   number of tweets were part of awareness campaigns (0.2\%) or displayed a
   supportive attitude (0.8\%). Terms were often used metaphorically in a
   stigmatizing manner as personal or political insults, while in
   everyday/social contexts, they were used in a trivializing manner to
   label eccentricity, oddness, overthinking and suspiciousness. Popularity
   and reach metrics show that these tweets were extensively retweeted,
   liked and reached millions of users. Conclusion This is the first study
   investigating attitudes towards schizophrenia on Turkish Twitter.
   Significantly higher rates of stigmatizing attitudes demonstrate the
   urgent need for public health and social awareness campaigns targeting
   stigma surrounding schizophrenia in Turkey.},

Abstract = {Introduction Cannabis use in pregnancy and post partum is increasing.
   Accessibility to cannabis has expanded due to the legalisation of
   cannabis in Canada. Therefore, there is a critical need to monitor the
   impact of cannabis on pregnancy outcomes and infant neurodevelopment.
   This pilot study will assess the feasibility of modern recruitment and
   data collection strategies adapted to the current cannabis environment
   and inform the design of a multicentre prospective birth cohort.Methods
   and analysis We will establish a pregnancy and birth cohort of 50
   cannabis users and 50 non-users recruited before delivery. We will
   follow the participants at regular visits from recruitment to 12 weeks
   post partum. Participants will provide demographic and socioeconomic
   data, report their cannabis use patterns, and provide biological
   samples. Biological samples include maternal and infant urine and blood,
   breastmilk/chestmilk, cord blood, cord tissue, placenta and meconium.
   All samples will be processed and stored at -80 \& DEG;C until analysis
   by immunoassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to
   determine the presence of cannabis metabolites. In addition, partners
   will be invited to provide additional socioeconomic and substance use
   data.Ethics and dissemination Ethics was obtained from Ottawa Health
   Science Network Research Ethics Board through Clinical Trials Ontario
   (3791). Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals,
   presented at scientific conferences and shared broadly with patients,
   healthcare decision-makers, and project partners online and through
   social media.},

Title = {Using the STROBE statement: survey findings emphasized the role of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the study was to identify factors affecting
   the use of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
   Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, specifically authors' attitudes toward
   and experiences with it.
   Study Design and Setting: An online survey was distributed to authors of
   observational studies recruited via social media, personal network
   snowballing, and mass mailings using targeted search strategies. Data on
   demographics, awareness, motivators, and usage were collected in
   conjunction with a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
   Technology (UTAUT) scale on which confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
   performed.
   Results: One thousand fifteen participants completed the survey. Of
   these, 185 (18.2\%) indicated they had never heard of STROBE nor used it
   previously, 195 (19.2\%) had heard of it but never used it, and 635
   (62.6\%) had used it. Journals promoting STROBE were both key motivators
   and awareness mechanisms; peers and educational workshops were also
   important influencing factors to a lesser degree. The internal
   consistency of the modified UTAUT scale was strong (Cronbach's alpha =
   0.94). CFA supported a four-factor model with 23 questions.
   Conclusion: The endorsement of STROBE by journals is key to authors'
   awareness and use of the guideline. We tested and validated our scale
   which can guide future research on reporting guidelines. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and
   share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media,
   such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common
   health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO);
   however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public
   health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this
   research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's
   opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as
   expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic
   framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of
   interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5
   million tweets, 8\% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7\% diet, 16.6\%
   exercise, and 51.7\% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics
   was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable
   correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity
   (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the
   DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with ``Diabetes{''},
   excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack,
   yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for ``Diet{''} included
   vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental
   health, while subtopics for ``Exercise{''} included computer games,
   brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for ``Obesity{''}
   included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media
   users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be
   utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and
   social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in
   regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.},

Title = {Day-to-day variability of knee pain and the relationship with physical
   activity in people with knee osteoarthritis: an observational,
   feasibility study using consumer smartwatches},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of using smartwatches in people with
   knee osteoarthritis (OA) to determine the day-to-day variability of pain
   and the relationship between daily pain and step
   count.DesignObservational, feasibility study.SettingIn July 2017, the
   study was advertised in newspapers, magazines and, on social media.
   Participants had to be living/willing to travel to Manchester.
   Recruitment was in September 2017 and data collection was completed in
   January 2018.Participants26 participants aged>50 years with
   self-diagnosed symptomatic knee OA were recruited.Outcome
   measuresParticipants were provided with a consumer cellular smartwatch
   with a bespoke app that triggered a series of daily questions including
   two times per day questions about level of knee pain and one time per
   month question from the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and
   Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. The smartwatch also
   recorded daily step counts.ResultsOf the 25 participants, 13 were men
   and their mean age was 65 years (standard deviation (SD) 8 years). The
   smartwatch app was successful in simultaneously assessing and recording
   data on knee pain and step count in real time. Knee pain was categorised
   into sustained high/low or fluctuating levels, but there was
   considerable day-to-day variation within these categories. Levels of
   knee pain in general correlated with pain assessed by KOOS. Those with
   sustained high/low levels of pain had a similar daily step count average
   (mean 3754 (SD 2524)/4307 (SD 2992)), but those with fluctuating pain
   had much lower step count levels (mean 2064 (SD
   1716)).ConclusionsSmartwatches can be used to assess pain and physical
   activity in knee OA. Larger studies may help inform a better
   understanding of causal links between physical activity patterns and
   pain. In time, this could inform development of personalised physical
   activity recommendations for people with knee OA.},

Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Abstract = {The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic offers a unique opportunity
   to conduct an infodemiological study examining patterns in online
   searching activity about a specific disease and how this relates to news
   media within a specific country. Google Trends quantifies volumes of
   online activity. The relative search volume was obtained for
   `Coronavirus', `handwashing', `face mask' and symptom related keywords,
   for the United Kingdom, from the date of the first confirmed case until
   numbers peaked in April. The relationship between online search traffic
   and confirmed case numbers was examined. Search volumes varied over
   time; peaks appear related to events in the progression of the epidemic
   which were reported in the media. Search activity on `Coronavirus'
   correlated well against confirmed case number as did `face mask' and
   symptom-related keywords. User-generated online data sources such as
   Google Trends may aid disease surveillance, being more responsive to
   changes in disease occurrence than traditional disease reporting. The
   relationship between media coverage and online searching activity is
   rarely examined, but may be driving online behavioural patterns.},

Title = {Monkeypox as a potential emerging pandemic: a discussion on future risks
   and preparedness in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by the Monkeypox virus, has emerged
   as a potential threat with pandemic potential in various regions. While
   it is challenging to predict specific outbreaks, understanding the
   factors contributing to Monkeypox's pandemic potential is important.
   This discussion paper explores the future risks and preparedness
   measures concerning Monkeypox in Saudi Arabia. The study reviews the
   past and current knowledge on the Monkeypox outbreak, including its
   clinical presentation, transmission dynamics (animals-to-humans and
   humans-to-human), epidemiology, and diagnostic methods. Furthermore, it
   explores the potential risk factors for the spread of Monkeypox within
   the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, mainly in the Saudi
   Arabian context, considering factors such as urbanization and travel and
   trade patterns. The paper emphasizes the importance of early virus
   detection, surveillance systems, and laboratory capacity in vaccinating
   and responding to Monkeypox cases. Additionally, it highlights the
   future risks and preparedness in Saudi Arabia and the usage of social
   media during the pandemic seeking support and awareness about Monkeypox,
   and it also highlights the need for effective communication strategies
   of leaders through social media channels to disseminate accurate
   information to the public, healthcare providers, and policymakers. The
   discussion concludes by calling for collaborative efforts among health
   authorities, researchers, and international medical partners to enhance
   surveillance, develop outbreak response plans, and ensure the
   availability of vaccines and treatment options. This research serves as
   a foundation for guiding future preventive measures and strengthening
   the overall preparedness of Saudi Arabia in facing the potential
   emergence of Monkeypox as a future pandemic.},

Title = {Sociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research: A scoping review},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundSociometric or whole network analysis, a method used to
   analyze relational patterns among social actors, emphasizes the role of
   social structure in shaping behaviour. Such method has been applied to
   many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public
   health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social
   networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network
   analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current
   scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network
   analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such
   methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of
   six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political
   Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO)
   returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be
   included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social
   network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized
   quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a
   description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network
   analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last
   decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree
   centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong
   to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network
   resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The
   second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social
   support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on
   the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service
   providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network
   SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate
   mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to
   study drug policy.},

Title = {The quality of YouTube videos on endoscopic third ventriculostomy and

   procedures available to families of patients with pediatric

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE YouTube has become an important information source for
   pediatric neurosurgical patients and their families. The goal of this
   study was to determine whether the informative quality of videos of
   endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and endoscopic third
   ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV +CPC) is
   associated with metrics of popularity.
   METHODS This cross-sectional study used comprehensive search terms to
   identify videos pertaining to ETV and ETV + CPC presented on the first 3
   pages of search results on YouTube. Two pediatric neurosurgeons, 1
   neurosurgery resident, and 2 patient families independently reviewed the
   selected videos. Videos were assessed for overall informational quality
   by using a validated 5-point Global Quality Score (GQS) and compared to
   online metrics of popularity and engagement such as views, likes,
   likes/views ratio, comments/views ratio, and likes/dislikes ratio.
   Weighted kappa scores were used to measure agreement between video
   reviewers.
   RESULTS A total of 58 videos (47 on ETV, 7 on ETV + CPC, 4 on both) of
   120 videos assessed met the inclusion criteria. Video styles included
   ``technical{''} (62\%), ``lecture{''} (24\%), ``patient testimonial{''}
   (4\%), and ``other{''} (10\%). In terms of GQS, substantial agreement
   was seen between surgeons (kappa 0.67 {[}95\% CI 0.55, 0.801) and
   excellent agreement was found between each surgeon and the neurosurgical
   resident (0.77 {[}95\% CI 0.66, 0.88] and 0.89 {[}95\% CI 0.82, 0.97]).
   Only fair to moderate agreement was seen between professionals and
   patient families, with weighted kappa scores ranging from 0.07 to 0.56.
   Academic lectures were more likely to be rated good or excellent (64\%
   vs 0\%, p < 0.001) versus surgical procedure and testimonial video
   types. There were significant associations between a better GQS and more
   likes (p = 0.01), views (p = 0.02), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p =
   0.016). The likes/views ratio (p = 0.31) and comments/views ratio (p =
   0.35) were not associated with GQS. The number of likes (p = 0.02),
   views (p = 0.03), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p = 0.015) were
   significantly associated with video style (highest for lecture-style
   videos).
   CONCLUSIONS Medical professionals tended to agree when assessing the
   overall quality of YouTube videos, but this agreement was not as
   strongly seen when compared to parental ratings. The online metrics of
   likes, views, and likes/dislikes ratio appear to predict quality.
   Neurosurgeons seeking to increase their online footprint via YouTube
   would be well advised to focus more on the academic lecture style
   because these were universally better rated.},

Abstract = {Higher education faces challenges in retaining students who require a
   command of numeracy in their chosen field of study. This study applies
   an innovative combination of relative risk and social network analysis
   to enrolment data of a single cohort of commencing students from an
   Australian regional university. Relative risk, often used in
   epidemiology studies, is used to strategically investigate whether first
   year mathematics subjects at the university demonstrated a higher risk
   of attrition when compared to other subjects offered in the first year
   of study. The network analysis is used to illustrate the connections of
   those mathematics subjects, identifying service subjects through their
   multiple connections. The analysis revealed that attrition rates for
   eight of the nine subjects were within acceptable limits, and this
   included identified service subjects. The exception highlighted the
   issue of mathematics competencies in this cohort. This combined
   analytical technique is proposed as appropriate for use when
   investigating attrition and retention at faculty and institutional
   levels, including the determination of levels of intervention and
   support for any subject.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal modeling of networks is of great practical importance,

   Despite rapid methodological advances, how to effectively and

   remains a challenging problem. To tackle this problem, we construct
   consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of
   a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected
   networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be
   real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed
   method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed
   networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the
   proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally
   distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for
   variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence
   properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial
   dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the
   proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model. Extensive
   simulation studies and data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method.},

Title = {Conceptualising the social networks of vulnerable children and young

Abstract = {Purpose The relationship between social networks and health and
   wellbeing is increasingly demonstrated in vulnerable adult populations.
   This relationship for vulnerable children and young people has not
   hitherto been systematically reviewed. This narrative synthesis aims to
   consolidate research to provide a foundational basis for future
   health-related social network research and interventions for children
   and young people. Methods This mixed methods systematic review
   synthesises research investigating whole, egocentric social networks of
   32 vulnerable child groups with a mean age below 18. There were no
   setting, language or date restrictions. The quality was assessed using
   the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 6360 search results, 49 were
   included for narrative synthesis. Results The majority of pertinent
   research originates from the USA; the most frequently investigated
   vulnerabilities were minority ethnic status, homelessness and the
   presence of special educational needs. Research aims and methodologies
   varied significantly between studies. Key findings included (i)
   vulnerable (excluding minority ethnic) children and young people have
   impoverished networks (ii) access to networks is a protective factor
   against negative outcomes (iii) social ties, primarily immediate family,
   provide access to personal resources and (iv) network ties are to a
   degree substitutable. Conclusions Networks are associated with wellbeing
   and vulnerable children and young people commonly have impoverished
   networks, excluding cases where vulnerability classification relates to
   minority ethnic status. Network embeddedness is associated with positive
   outcomes, particularly for homeless children. Family are typically
   primary providers of support, but ties are substitutable when networks
   are restricted. Egocentric social network research is currently limited
   for vulnerable child populations. Further research could inform
   interventions that harness networks to improve health, wellbeing and
   functional outcomes for these child groups.},

Abstract = {Detecting ``hotspots{''} and ``anomalies{''} is a recurring problem with
   a wide range of applications, such as social network analysis,
   epidemiology, finance, and biosurveillance, among others. Networks are a
   common abstraction in these applications for representing complex
   relationships. Typically, these networks are dynamic-, i.e., they evolve
   over time. A number of methods have been proposed for anomaly detection
   in such dynamic network data sets, which are primarily based on changes
   in network properties. We provide a survey of the various formulations
   of anomaly detection in dynamic networks with a focus on
   ``window-based{''} methods. Window-based methods first define a time
   window of past network snapshots to model normal behavior and then mark
   a snapshot as anomalous if it has significantly different patterns from
   those observed in the time window. We describe two classes of
   techniques: 1) generalizations of Steiner connectivity; and 2) dense
   subgraph mining. Both have been used extensively in window-based graph
   anomaly detection. We summarize the key problem formulations that have
   been studied using these approaches, and we describe details of some of
   the main techniques.},

Title = {Addressing bias in artificial intelligence for public health
   surveillance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 2},
Abstract = {Components of artificial intelligence (AI) for analysing social big
   data, such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, have
   improved the timeliness and robustness of health data. NLP techniques
   have been implemented to analyse large volumes of text from social media
   platforms to gain insights on disease symptoms, understand barriers to
   care and predict disease outbreaks. However, AI-based decisions may
   contain biases that could misrepresent populations, skew results or lead
   to errors. Bias, within the scope of this paper, is described as the
   difference between the predictive values and true values within the
   modelling of an algorithm. Bias within algorithms may lead to inaccurate
   healthcare outcomes and exacerbate health disparities when results
   derived from these biased algorithms are applied to health
   interventions. Researchers who implement these algorithms must consider
   when and how bias may arise. This paper explores algorithmic biases as a
   result of data collection, labelling and modelling of NLP algorithms.
   Researchers have a role in ensuring that efforts towards combating bias
   are enforced, especially when drawing health conclusions derived from
   social media posts that are linguistically diverse. Through the
   implementation of open collaboration, auditing processes and the
   development of guidelines, researchers may be able to reduce bias and
   improve NLP algorithms that improve health surveillance.},

Title = {Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a

   survey},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health
   condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19
   pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and
   risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the
   beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the
   Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based
   online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The
   analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a
   mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24,
   2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items
   related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the
   pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items
   on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and
   hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to
   identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen
   percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for
   at least 3 days over the past week; 13\% had three or more symptoms.
   Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using
   social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak
   caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was
   a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or
   finances. This has important implications for mental health service
   delivery.},

Title = {Evaluation of different machine learning approaches and input text
   representations for multilingual classification of tweets for disease
   surveillance in the social web},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Twitter and social media as a whole have great potential as a source of
   disease surveillance data however the general messiness of tweets
   presents several challenges for standard information extraction methods.
   Most deployed systems employ approaches that rely on simple keyword
   matching and do not distinguish between relevant and irrelevant keyword
   mentions making them susceptible to false positives as a result of the
   fact that keyword volume can be influenced by several social phenomena
   that may be unrelated to disease occurrence. Furthermore, most solutions
   are intended for a single language and those meant for multilingual
   scenarios do not incorporate semantic context. In this paper we
   experimentally examine different approaches for classifying text for
   epidemiological surveillance on the social web in addition we offer a
   systematic comparison of the impact of different input representations
   on performance. Specifically we compare continuous representations
   against one-hot encoding for word-based, class-based (ontology-based)
   and subword units in the form of byte pair encodings. We also go on to
   establish the desirable performance characteristics for multi-lingual
   semantic filtering approaches and offer an in-depth discussion of the
   implications for end-to-end surveillance.},

Abstract = {Purpose The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   pandemic is associated with worsening mental health among young adults,
   but further research is necessary to quantify the associations with
   depression and anxiety. Methods Using Monitoring the Future data (N =
   1244 young adults, modal age: 19, Fall 2020 supplement), we examined
   internalizing symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized
   Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 separately), dividing the sample into those
   without clinically significant scores, significant scores but minimal
   pandemic-attributed symptoms, and significant scores with substantial
   pandemic-attributed symptoms. Logistic regression analyses linked
   demographic factors, pandemic-related experiences, and coping methods to
   symptom groups. Results Internalizing symptoms were highly prevalent,
   with many occurring among a majority at least several days over the past
   2 weeks. Major changes in education, employment, and resource
   availability predicted elevated symptom risk (e.g., lacking a place to
   sleep or money for rent, gas, or food led to 4.43 {[}95\% confidence
   interval: 2.59-7.55] times the risk of high depressive symptoms
   significantly attributed to the pandemic). High internalizing symptoms
   were linked to underutilization of healthy coping behaviors, substance
   use overutilization, and dietary changes. High depressive and anxious
   symptoms attributed to the pandemic were marked by high levels of taking
   breaks from the news/social media and contacting healthcare providers.
   Conclusions The pandemic's associations with young adults' depressive
   and anxious symptoms warrants urgent attention through improved mental
   health treatment infrastructure and stronger structural support.},

Title = {B Part of It protocol: a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess
   the impact of 4CMenB vaccine on pharyngeal carriage of <i>Neisseria
   meningitidis</i> in adolescents},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {Introduction South Australia (SA) has the highest notification rate of
   invasive meningococcal disease in Australia with the majority of cases
   due to serogroup B. Neisseria meningitidis is carried in the pharynx,
   with adolescents having the highest rates of carriage. A vaccine
   designed to offer protection against serogroup B (4CMenB) is licensed in
   Australia. The SA MenB vaccine carriage study aims to assess the impact
   of 4CMenB on carriage of N. meningitidis in adolescents.
   Methods and analysis This is a parallel cluster randomised controlled
   trial enrolling year 10, 11 and 12 school students (approximately 16-18
   years of age) throughout SA, in metropolitan and rural/remote areas.
   Schools are randomised to intervention (4CMenB vaccination at baseline)
   or control (4CMenB vaccination at study completion) with randomisation
   stratified by school size and socioeconomic status, as measured by the
   Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (Australian Curriculum).
   Oropharyngeal swabs will be taken from all students at visit 1, and 12
   months later from year 11 and 12 students. Students unvaccinated in 2017
   will receive vaccine at the 12-month follow-up. Carriage prevalence of
   N. meningitidis will be determined by PCR at baseline and 12 months
   following 4CMenB vaccination and compared with carriage prevalence at 12
   months in unvaccinated students. A questionnaire will be completed at
   baseline and 12 months to assess risk factors associated with carriage.
   The primary outcome of carriage prevalence of disease causing N.
   meningitidis at 12 months will be compared between groups using logistic
   regression, with generalised estimating equations used to account for
   clustering at the school level. The difference in carriage prevalence
   between groups will be expressed as an OR with 95\% CI.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Women's and
   Children's Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (WCHN HREC).
   The protocol, informed consent forms, recruitment materials, social
   media and all participant materials have been reviewed and approved by
   the WCHN HREC and updated on ClinicalTrials.gov. Results will be
   published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at
   national and international conferences. The study findings will be
   provided in public forums and to study participants and participating
   schools.},

Title = {Association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health in
   older adults: an analysis of data from the Korean Social Life, Health,
   and Aging Project},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The adverse health effects of individual-level social
   isolation (e.g., perceived loneliness) have been well documented in
   older adults. However, little is known about the impact of
   collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought to
   examine the association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular
   health (CVH) in older adults.
   METHODS: From the prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging
   Project database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who
   were aged >= 60 years or were married to those aged >= 60 years.
   Participants who belonged to smaller social groups separate from the
   major social group were defined as group-level-segregated. The CVH score
   was calculated as the number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as
   modified from the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using
   ordinal logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and
   longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and CVH.
   RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years; 60.0\% female),
   108 (20.5\%) were segregated at baseline. In the cross-sectional
   analysis, group-level segregation was significantly associated with
   lower odds of having a higher CVH score at baseline after adjusting for
   socio-demographic factors and cognitive function (odds ratio {[}OR],
   0.64; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.43 to 0.95). Among 274
   participants who completed an 8-year follow-up, group-level segregation
   at baseline was marginally associated with lower odds of having a higher
   CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.24 to 1.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse CVH.
   These findings imply that the social network structure of a community
   may influence its members' health status.},

Abstract = {Introduction In the pandemic, healthcare professionals face even higher
   levels of stress. It is therefore a priority to estimate the impact of
   the pandemic on mental health and to propose targeted strategies to
   improve resilience. The aims of the study were to (1) assess the mental
   health of healthcare professionals working with patients with COVID-19
   and identify social determinants that may increase the risk of negative
   outcomes; and (2) test the effectiveness of an intervention to improve
   the resilience of healthcare professionals in France. Methods and
   analysis To evaluate the first objective, a national longitudinal study
   will be carried out among healthcare professionals working with patients
   with COVID-19. Participants will be recruited via an internet link that
   will be widely disseminated on social media, mailing lists, medical
   boards and French medical journals. Primary outcomes are mental health
   distress/symptoms and resilience. Secondary outcomes are burnout, social
   and occupational supports and substance use. To meet the second
   objective, an interventional study will be conducted. The main outcome
   is the effectiveness of the PsySTART-Responder and the
   Anticipate.Plan.Deter program. Qualitative analyses will be conducted to
   understand the strategies used to cope with the pandemic. Ethics and
   dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Sorbonne Universite
   Ethical Committee (No 2020-CER-2020-27) and was declared to French
   Commission on Information Technology and Liberties, CNIL (N degrees
   2222413, 20-05-2021). The results of this study will provide a better
   understanding of mental health and social inequalities in mental health
   among healthcare professionals working in the pandemic; data about the
   effectiveness of the PsySTART-Responder and the Anticipate.Plan.Deter
   interventional program in France.},

Abstract = {Introduction Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
   chronic mental disorder that is associated with poor productivity, with
   a significant impact on the quality of life. Objectives To determine
   factors associated with symptoms of ADHD among medical students in
   Cameroon. Design A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting Participants
   were recruited through a social media platform, WhatsApp, from 24 June
   to 2 September 2018. Participants Medical students aged 18 years and
   older from seven medical schools in Cameroon. All non-medical students
   and all medical residents were excluded. Results Data from a total of
   491 eligible participants were analysed. The median age was 25 (IQR
   21-25) years and 54\% were of the participants were female. The
   prevalence of self-reported symptoms of ADHD was 24.4\% (95\% CI 20.6\%
   to 28.3\%). Histories of chronic disease (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.96; 95\%
   CI 1.49 to 5.86, p=0.002), family history of ADHD (AOR 3.38; 95\% CI
   1.04 to 10.44, p=0.035), severe depression (AOR=3.49; 95\% CI 1.82 to
   6.77, p<0.001) and anxiety disorder (AOR 2.06; 95\% CI 1.25 to 3.36,
   p=0.004) were found to be independently associated with the symptoms of
   ADHD. Conclusion ADHD may be a highly prevalent mental disorder among
   medical students, and is associated with severe depression, anxiety
   disorders and chronic diseases. There is a need to conduct a large-scale
   prospective cohort study with interviews to estimate the true prevalence
   and incidence of ADHD among medical students in Cameroon, and to
   determinant the risk factors associated with the disorder.},

Abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization recommends at least 6 months
   of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Longitudinal studies facilitate
   estimation of EBF duration, but often suffer from loss to follow-up and
   missing information. The study estimates the prevalence of EBF, duration
   and predictors of EBF duration while adjusting for missing data using
   multiple imputation (MI).
   Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted on all women giving birth
   between September 2009-February 2010 in selected hospitals (N=2119).
   Data on EBF and socio-demographic and other characteristics were
   collected at birth, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. Information on EBF
   status and duration was missing for 29\%. To deal with missing data, we
   generated multiple datasets using logistic regression-based MI to impute
   missing EBF practice, and an accelerated failure time (AFT) model to
   impute missing duration of EBF. The latter model also identified factors
   associated with EBF duration.
   Results: The observed 64\% of women practicing EBF (95\% CI; 62\%-66\%)
   was adjusted, after imputation, to 62\% (95\% CI; 60\%-65\%). After
   imputation, the estimated median time of EBF among women practicing EBF
   was 4.9 months. Predictors of EBF duration were stated intention to
   breastfeed, religious observance, and giving formula milk while in
   hospital.
   Conclusion: Adjusting estimates of EBF practice and duration using MI is
   feasible and potentially important. Using an AFT model for EBF duration
   enables the execution of MI in such studies and allows direct
   interpretation of the impact of various factors on EBF duration.},

Title = {Estimating the potential for disease spread in horses associated with an
   equestrian show in Ontario, Canada using an agent-based model},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {21-28},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Participation in equestrian shows provides opportunities for contact
   between horses, increasing the risk of disease introduction and spread
   within the population. The magnitude of a potential outbreak, and the
   impact of disease prevention and control strategies, can be estimated
   using simulation modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1)
   examine the potential spread of equine influenza in a network of horses
   associated with a 2-day equestrian show in Ontario, Canada; and (2)
   determine the effectiveness of several interventions during a simulated
   outbreak. A discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic agent-based
   simulation model was constructed to represent horses associated with the
   show, including those in attendance at the show, and those that were not
   in attendance but co-boarded with attending horses at their home
   facilities. At the beginning of each simulation run, one random horse in
   attendance at the show was infected with equine influenza. In the
   absence of interventions, the median attack rate was 0.029 (IQR:
   0.016-0.056; mean: 0.043; 95\% CI: 0.040-0.044) and the average outbreak
   duration was 19.58 days (95\% CI: 19.31-19.85). The most effective
   intervention was the implementation of either a 5-day or 14-day
   quarantine period, which both resulted in the same median attack rate of
   0.0026 (IQR 0.0013-0.0039), although the mean attack rates differed
   (mean: 0.0043, 95\% CI: 0.0039-0.0046; and mean: 0.0029, 95\% CI:
   0.0028-0.0029; respectively). In instances where implementing either a
   5-day or 14-day quarantine period would not be feasible, quarantine for
   shorter time periods was effective when combined with targeted increases
   in initial facility-level vaccine coverage. The combined implementation
   of a 2-day quarantine period and an increased vaccine coverage of 75\%
   in facilities with four or more owners resulted in a median attack rate
   of 0.013 (IQR: 0.0052-0.026; mean: 0.022; 95\% CI: 0.020-0.024). This
   study demonstrates a relative comparison of intervention effectiveness
   during a simulated outbreak of equine influenza in a population of
   horses associated with an equestrian show. The results have the
   potential to inform and improve the current strategies used to prevent
   the introduction and spread of disease within the equine population.},

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease:
   results of a worldwide survey},
Journal = {RMD OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 disproportionately
   affects people from racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status
   (SES) groups. Many physicians across the globe are changing practice
   patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the
   practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact
   to be on their most vulnerable patients. Methods We administered an
   online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide
   during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May
   2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists
   about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic
   minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what
   their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication
   access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty,
   food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating
   the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. Results 548
   rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food
   insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude
   social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among
   their patients. Although 82\% of rheumatologists had switched to
   telehealth video, 17\% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of
   their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those
   from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these
   vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES
   groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the
   pandemic. Conclusion In this sample of rheumatologists from 64
   countries, there is a clear shift in practice to telehealth video
   consultations and widespread concern for socially and economically
   vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms have become accessible resources for health data
   analysis. However, the advanced computational techniques involved in big
   data text mining and analysis are challenging for public health data
   analysts to apply. This study proposes and explores the feasibility of a

   on the aggregated influence scores for association and/or classification
   analyses based on generalized linear models. The method reduces the
   document term matrix by transforming text data into a continuous summary
   score, thereby reducing the data dimension substantially and easing the
   data sparsity issue of the term matrix. To illustrate the proposed
   method in detailed steps, we used three Twitter datasets on various
   topics: autism spectrum disorder, influenza, and violence against women.
   We found that our results were generally consistent with the critical
   factors associated with the specific public health topic in the existing
   literature. The proposed method could also classify tweets into
   different topic groups appropriately with consistent performance
   compared with existing text mining methods for automatic classification

Title = {Prevalence of questionable health behaviours in Serbia and their
   psychological roots: protocol for a nationally representative survey},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {IntroductionWe will launch a national survey in Serbia to document the
   prevalence of two types of questionable health behaviours: (1)
   intentional non-adherence to medical recommendations and (2) use of
   traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practices, as well
   as the relation between the two. We will also investigate their
   psychological roots, including (a) `distal' predictors such as HEXACO
   personality traits (plus Disintegration) and thinking dispositions
   (rational/experiential thinking and cognitive reflexivity), and (b)
   `proximal' predictors under the umbrella `irrational mindset' (set of
   unfounded beliefs consisting of conspiratorial thinking, superstition,
   magical health beliefs as well as selected cognitive biases), which have
   more content-wise overlap with the health behaviours.Methods and
   analysisIn this cross-sectional study, a research agency will collect
   data from a nationally representative sample (n=1043; age 18-75 years;
   estimated start/end-June/November 2021) recruited online (approximately,
   70\% of the sample, aged 18-54; 11 years) and face-to-face
   (approximately, 30\% of the sample, aged 55-75 years). Participants will
   complete a battery of tests assessing questionable health behaviours,
   basic personality traits, thinking dispositions, irrational mindset,
   sociopolitical beliefs, sociodemographic and health-related variables.
   Prevalence rates will be calculated using descriptive statistics. To
   explore the relation between (psychological) predictors and questionable
   health behaviours, we will use hierarchical regression and partial
   mediation models (path analysis or full SEM models).Ethics and
   disseminationEthical Committees of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade
   (\#935/1), Faculty of Special Education and Rehabilitation (\#139/1) and
   Faculty of Media and Communications (\#228) approved the protocol. Only
   participants who provide informed consent will participate in the study.
   A research report based on the study results will be submitted to
   peer-reviewed journals and results will be made available to
   stakeholders through reports on the project website

Title = {Linking coastal environmental and health observations for human
   wellbeing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Coastal areas have long been attractive places to live, work, and
   recreate and remain so even in the face of growing threats from global
   environmental change. At any moment, a significant portion of the human
   population is exposed to both positive and negative health effects
   associated with coastal locations. Some locations may be ``hotspots{''}
   of concern for human health due to ongoing climatic and other changes,
   accentuating the need for better understanding of coastal
   environment-human health linkages. This paper describes how
   environmental and health data could be combined to create a coastal
   environmental and human health observing system. While largely based on
   information from the US and Europe, the concept should be relevant to
   almost any coastal area. If implemented, a coastal health observing
   system would connect a variety of human health data and environmental
   observations for individuals and communities, and where possible
   cohorts. Health data would be derived from questionnaires and other
   personal sources, clinical examinations, electronic health records,
   wearable devices, and syndromic surveillance, plus information on
   vulnerability and health-relevant community characteristics, and social
   media observations. Environmental data sources would include weather and
   climate, beach and coastal conditions, sentinel species, occurrences of
   harmful organisms and substances, seafood safety advisories, and
   distribution, proximity, and characteristics of health-promoting green
   and blue spaces. Where available, information on supporting resources
   could be added. Establishment of a linked network of coastal health
   observatories could provide powerful tools for understanding the
   positive and negative health effects of coastal living, lead to better
   health protections and enhanced wellbeing, and provide significant
   benefits to coastal residents, including the historically disadvantaged,
   as well as the military, hospitals and emergency departments, academic
   medical, public health, and environmental health programs, and others.
   Early networks could provide best practices and lessons learned to
   assist later entries.},

Title = {Identifying and addressing conflicting results across multiple
   discordant systematic reviews on the same question: protocol for a
   replication study of the Jadad algorithm},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction An increasing growth of systematic reviews (SRs) presents
   notable challenges for decision-makers seeking to answer clinical
   questions. In 1997, an algorithm was created by Jadad to assess
   discordance in results across SRs on the same question. Our study aims
   to (1) replicate assessments done in a sample of studies using the Jadad
   algorithm to determine if the same SR would have been chosen, (2)
   evaluate the Jadad algorithm in terms of utility, efficiency and
   comprehensiveness, and (3) describe how authors address discordance in
   results across multiple SRs. Methods and analysis We will use a database
   of 1218 overviews (2000-2020) created from a bibliometric study as the
   basis of our search for studies assessing discordance (called discordant
   reviews). This bibliometric study searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Epistemonikos
   and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for overviews. We will
   include any study using Jadad (1997) or another method to assess
   discordance. The first 30 studies screened at the full-text stage by two
   independent reviewers will be included. We will replicate the authors'
   Jadad assessments. We will compare our outcomes qualitatively and
   evaluate the differences between our Jadad assessment of discordance and
   the authors' assessment. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval was
   required as no human subjects were involved. In addition to publishing
   in an open-access journal, we will disseminate evidence summaries
   through formal and informal conferences, academic websites, and across
   social media platforms. This is the first study to comprehensively
   evaluate and replicate Jadad algorithm assessments of discordance across
   multiple SRs.},

Title = {Suicide mortality in the city of Sao Paulo: epidemiological
   characteristics and their social factors in a temporal trend between
   2000 and 2017. Retrospective study},
Journal = {SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {138},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide,
   accounting for one million deaths annually. Greater understanding of the
   causal risk factors is needed, especially in large urban centers.
   OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the epidemiological profile and temporal trend
   of suicides over two decades and correlate prevalence with social
   indicators.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive population-based longitudinal
   retrospective study conducted in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   METHODS: A temporal trend series for suicide mortality in this city was
   constructed based on data from the Ministry of Health's mortality
   notification system, covering 2000-2017. It was analyzed using classic
   demographic variables relating to social factors.
   RESULTS: Suicide rates were high throughout this period, increasing from
   4.6/100,000 inhabitants in the 2000s to 4.9/100,000 in 2017 (mean:
   4.7/100,000). The increase in mortality was mainly due to increased male
   suicide, which went from 6.0/100,000 to the current 8.0/100,000. Other
   higher coefficients corresponded to social risk factors, such as being a
   young adult (25-44 years old), being more educated (eight years of
   schooling) and having white ethnicity (67.2\%). Suicide was also twice
   as likely to occur at home (47.8\%).
   CONCLUSION: High suicide rates were seen over the period 2000-2017,
   especially among young adults and males. High schooling levels and white
   ethnicity were risk factors. The home environment is the crucial arena
   for preventive action. One special aspect of primary prevention is the
   internet and especially social media, which provides a multitude of
   information for suicide prevention.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this scoping review was to summarize
   literature regarding the use of user-generated digital data collected
   for non-epidemiological purposes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   research.Recent FindingsThirty-nine papers were included in the final
   review. Four types of digital data were used: social media data, web
   search queries, mobile phone data, and data from global positioning
   system (GPS) devices. With these data, four HIV epidemiological
   objectives were pursued, including disease surveillance, behavioral
   surveillance, assessment of public attention to HIV, and
   characterization of risk contexts. Approximately one-third used machine
   learning for classification, prediction, or topic modeling. Less than a
   quarter discussed the ethics of using user-generated data for
   epidemiological purposes.SummaryUser-generated digital data can be used
   to monitor, predict, and contextualize HIV risk and can help disrupt
   trajectories of risk closer to onset. However, more attention needs to
   be paid to digital ethics and the direction of the field in a
   post-Application Programming Interface (API) world.},

Title = {Increase in incidence of anorexia nervosa among 10-to 14-year-old girls:
   A nationwide study in the Netherlands over four decades},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis primary care study examined time trends in the incidence
   of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) in the Netherlands
   across four decades.MethodsA nationwide network of general
   practitioners, serving approximately 1\% of the total Dutch population,
   recorded newly diagnosed patients with AN and BN in their practices from
   1985 to 2019 (2,890,978 person-years). DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were
   consistently used and the same psychiatrist was responsible for the
   final diagnostic decision. Incidence rates (IRs) were calculated for:
   the total population (all ages), females overall, and females per 5-year
   age category. Time trends in IRs were analyzed using JoinPoint
   regression analyses.ResultsIn four decades, the incidence of AN among
   10- to 14-year-old females increased significantly from 8.6 to 38.6 per
   100,000 person-years (average period percentage change {[}APPC] = 56.7;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 6.5-130.6. The overall incidence of AN
   was stable, with IRs ranging from 6.0 (95\% CI = 4.3-8.1) to 8.4 (95\%
   CI = 6.4-10.8). The IR of BN decreased significantly from 8.7 (95\% CI =
   6.7-11.0) to 3.2 (95\% CI = 2.0-4.9) in the 2000s, before leveling off
   in the 2010s (IR 3.2; 95\% CI = 2.0-4.8).DiscussionThe incidence of AN
   among 10- to 14-year-old girls increased significantly over four
   decades. Both biological and sociocultural factors, for example, early
   pubertal timing and the impact of social media, might explain this. In
   other age groups and overall, the incidence of AN remained stable. The
   significant decrease of the incidence of BN in the previous decades
   halted in the last decade.Public SignificanceAn important finding of the
   present study is that for 10- to 14-year-old girls, the risk for
   developing anorexia nervosa has increased significantly over 40 years.
   More healthcare facilities for younger people are needed, and prevention
   programs could include social media use. For bulimia nervosa, the
   general decrease in the occurrence of new cases has halted in the 2010s.},

Abstract = {PurposeDigital media use has been associated with psychotic experiences
   in youth from the community, but the direction of association remains
   unclear. We aimed to examine between- and within-person associations of
   digital media use and psychotic experiences in youth.MethodsThe sample
   included 425 participants aged 18-25 years (82.5\% female) from the
   community, followed between May 2021 and January 2022 over 3 time
   points-of which 263 participants (61.9\%) completed at least 2. Digital
   media use was self-reported as time spent daily on TV and streaming
   platforms, social media, and video games over the past 3 months.
   Psychotic experiences in the past 3 months were measured with the
   15-item Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences. Associations
   between digital media use and psychotic experiences were estimated using
   a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model.ResultsOn average,
   individuals who reported greater digital media use also reported higher
   levels of psychotic experiences (r = 0.34, 95\% CI 0.15, 0.53). However,
   a person's variation in digital media use, relative to their personal
   average, was not significantly associated with subsequent variations in
   their levels of psychotic experiences, or vice-versa. Results were
   similar across TV/streaming, social media and video game use, and after
   adjusting for age, sex, education, sleep, physical activity, and
   cannabis use.ConclusionIndividuals with a tendency for higher levels of
   digital media use also had a tendency for higher levels of psychotic
   experiences. Understanding this association may help personalize mental
   health interventions for people with psychotic experiences, which may be
   offered digitally to promote their accessibility.},

Title = {Respiratory function and respiratory complications in spinal cord
   injury: protocol for a prospective, multicentre cohort study in
   high-income countries},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction Pneumonia is one of the leading complications and causes of
   death after a spinal cord injury (SCI). After a cervical or thoracic
   lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory
   function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications.
   Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong
   inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse,
   lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved
   through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as
   to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive.
   Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict
   pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the
   protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to
   evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict
   and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI.
   Methods and analysis RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began
   recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from
   Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients
   with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic
   lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour
   mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are
   eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The
   primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes
   include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the
   longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk
   factors.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by all
   local ethics committees of all participating centres. Study results will
   be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed
   journals and conference presentations, to the SCI community, other
   stakeholders and via social media, newsletters and engagement
   activities.},

Title = {Perceptions of cervical cancer prevention on Twitter uncovered by
   different sampling strategies},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Cervical cancer prevention is possible through use of the HPV vaccine
   and Pap tests, yet the vaccine remains underutilized.
   Methods
   We obtained publicly-available Twitter data from 2014 using three
   sampling strategies (top-ranked, simple random sample, and topic model)
   based on key words related to cervical cancer prevention. We conducted a
   content analysis of 100 tweets from each of the three samples and
   examined the extent to which the narratives and frequency of themes
   differed across samples.
   Results
   Advocacy-related tweets constituted the most prevalent theme to emerge
   across all three sample types, and were most frequently found in the
   top-ranked sample. A random sample detected the same themes as topic
   modeling, but the relative frequency of themes identified from topic
   modeling fell in-between top-ranked and random samples.
   Discussion
   Variations in themes uncovered by different sampling methods suggest it
   is useful to qualitatively assess the relative frequency of themes to
   better understand the breadth and depth of social media conversations
   about health.
   Conclusions
   Future studies using social media data should consider sampling methods
   to uncover a wider breadth of conversations about health on social
   media.},

Abstract = {Background Multidisciplinary collaboration is defined as a collective
   work involving multiple disciplines and is common in clinical care and
   research. Our aim was to describe current clinical and research
   collaboration among young specialists and to identify unmet needs in
   this area. Methods An online survey was disseminated by email and social
   media to members of the EMerging EUlar NETwork, the Young Nephrologists'
   Platform, the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society Emerging
   Rheumatologists and Researchers and the European Academy of Allergy and
   Clinical Immunology Junior Members. Results Of 303 respondents from 36
   countries, 61\% were female, 21\% were aged below 30 years and 67\% were
   aged 31-40 years. Young rheumatologists were the most represented
   (39\%), followed by young nephrologists (24\%), young paediatricians
   (20\%), young allergologists (11\%) then young internists (3\%) and 3\%
   other specialities. Collaborations were reported frequently by phone and
   email, also by various combined clinics while common local
   multidisciplinary meetings were uncommon. 96\% would like to develop
   clinical research collaborations and 69\% basic research collaborations.
   The majority of young specialists would be interested in online (84\%)
   and/or 1-2 days (85\%) common courses including case discussion (81\%)
   and training workshops (85\%), as well as webinars recorded with several
   specialists on a specific disease (96\%). Conclusions This collaborative
   initiative highlighted wishes from young specialists for developing (1)
   regular local multidisciplinary meetings to discuss complex patients,
   (2) clinical research collaboration with combined grants and (3)
   multidisciplinary online projects such as common courses, webinars and
   apps.},

Title = {Development of a Lexicon for Pain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {Pain has been an area of growing interest in the past decade and is
   known to be associated with mental health issues. Due to the ambiguous
   nature of how pain is described in text, it presents a unique natural
   language processing (NLP) challenge. Understanding how pain is described
   in text and utilizing this knowledge to improve NLP tasks would be of
   substantial clinical importance. Not much work has previously been done
   in this space. For this reason, and in order to develop an English
   lexicon for use in NLP applications, an exploration of pain concepts
   within free text was conducted. The exploratory text sources included
   two hospital databases, a social media platform (Twitter), and an online
   community (Reddit). This exploration helped select appropriate sources
   and inform the construction of a pain lexicon. The terms within the
   final lexicon were derived from three sources-literature, ontologies,
   and word embedding models. This lexicon was validated by two clinicians
   as well as compared to an existing 26-term pain sub-ontology and MeSH
   (Medical Subject Headings) terms. The final validated lexicon consists
   of 382 terms and will be used in downstream NLP tasks by helping select
   appropriate pain-related documents from electronic health record (EHR)
   databases, as well as pre-annotating these words to help in development
   of an NLP application for classification of mentions of pain within the
   documents. The lexicon and the code used to generate the embedding
   models have been made publicly available.},

Title = {Foundations and Modeling of Dynamic Networks Using Dynamic Graph Neural
   Networks: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {79143-79168},
Abstract = {Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social
   network analysis, recommender systems and epidemiology. Representing
   complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models
   to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as
   dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of
   inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile,
   graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent
   years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science
   tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the
   popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic
   network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for
   dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that
   this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph
   neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to
   address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a
   foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and
   notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph
   neural network models using the proposed terminology.},

   aged 14-15 years in New Zealand (N = 11,405), response rate 65\% (2012),
   64\% (2014-2016) and 59\% (2018).Results: Between 2012 and 2018 lifetime
   cannabis use decreased, but regular use (past month, weekly, daily) was
   stable. Prevalence of past month, weekly and daily use in 2016-2018
   (pooled) was 8.6\%, 3.4\% and 1.5\%, respectively. Cannabis vaping was
   reported by 24\% of past month cannabis users. The demographic profile
   of early-onset cannabis smokers and vapers was similar, with elevated
   use of both modes among Maori (Indigenous), same- or both-sex attracted
   students and those in low decile (high-deprivation) schools. Correlates
   were similar for both modes. Cannabis use was strongly associated with
   tobacco and alcohol use. The next strongest associations (after
   adjustment) were exposure to second-hand smoke at home, student income
   >\$50/week and low parental monitoring of whereabouts. Past week social
   media use, psychological distress and low parental monitoring of
   spending were also associated with both modes.Discussion and
   conclusions: Early-onset cannabis use is much higher in structurally
   disadvantaged groups, and among those who use tobacco and alcohol.
   Comprehensive multisubstance approaches to prevention are indicated in
   this age group. Efforts to reduce socio-economic inequity and exposure
   to other risk factors may reduce cannabis-related harm.},

Title = {The role of science communication and academic health advocacy in
   improving population oral health and tackling inequalities},
Journal = {COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {606-608},
Month = {2023 AUG},
Abstract = {Oral conditions are a public health problem globally and stark oral
   health inequalities exist between and within countries. Yet, oral
   diseases are rarely considered as a health priority and
   evidence-informed policy generation is challenging. Science
   communication and health advocacy are critical in that respect. However,
   due to time limitations, research workload and other factors, academics
   are usually hindered from participating in such lengthy endeavours.
   Here, we make the case that `science communication and health advocacy
   task forces' should be a priority at academic institutions. The two main
   duties of these task forces are knowledge transfer about the burden of
   oral conditions and patterns of inequalities, and their underlying
   social and commercial determinants, and advocacy and mediation between
   the stakeholders involved directly or indirectly in policy making. These
   interdisciplinary task forces, including both academics and
   non-academics, should collectively have skills that include (1)
   knowledge about oral health, dental public health and epidemiology, (2)
   ability to communicate clearly and coherently and make the case in both
   lay and scientific language terms, (3) familiarity with digital and
   social media platforms and ability to create visual aids, videos and
   documentaries, (4) good negotiation skills and (5) maintaining
   scientific transparency and avoiding getting involved in confrontation
   with political parties. In the current context, the role of the academic
   institutions should not only be the production of knowledge, but also
   the active transferability and application of this knowledge towards
   public benefit.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) discovers useful patterns from the
   dynamic interplay between space and time. Several available surveys
   capture STDM advances and report a wealth of important progress in this
   field. However, STDM challenges and problems are not thoroughly
   discussed and presented in articles of their own. We attempt to fill
   this gap by providing a comprehensive literature survey on
   state-of-the-art advances in STDM. We describe the challenging issues
   and their causes and open gaps of multiple STDM directions and aspects.
   Specifically, we investigate the challenging issues in regards to
   spatiotemporal relationships, interdisciplinarity, discretisation, and
   data characteristics. Moreover, we discuss the limitations in the
   literature and open research problems related to spatiotemporal data
   representations, modelling and visualisation, and comprehensiveness of
   approaches. We explain issues related to STDM tasks of classification,
   clustering, hotspot detection, association and pattern mining, outlier
   detection, visualisation, visual analytics, and computer vision tasks.
   We also highlight STDM issues related to multiple applications including
   crime and public safety, traffic and transportation, earth and
   environment monitoring, epidemiology, social media, and Internet of
   Things.},

Abstract = {Population adoption of social distancing measures during the COVID-19
   pandemic is at times deficient, increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2
   transmission. Healthcare workers and those living in areas of intense
   transmission may benefit from implementing biosafety measures in their
   daily lives. A mixed-methods approach, combining components of single
   negotiation text and the Delphi method, was used to create a COVID-19
   biosafety-at-home protocol. A consensus building coordinator liaised
   with 12 experts to develop the protocol over 11 iterations. Experts had
   more than 200 years of combined experience in epidemiology, virology,
   infectious disease prevention, and public health. A flyer, created from
   the final protocol, was professionally designed and initially
   distributed via social media and institutional websites/emails in
   Ecuador beginning on May 2, 2020. Since then, it has been distributed in
   other countries, reaching similar to 7,000 people. Translating research

Month = {2021 AUG},
Abstract = {Introduction: Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a
   backseat when the limited resources are geared for pandemic containment.
   In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental
   health issues have been reported from all over the world. Objectives: In
   this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues
   during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive
   strategies established in mental health care with special reference to
   the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available
   evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework
   for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar
   were undertaken using the search terms `novel coronavirus', `COVID-19',
   `nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, `mental health', `psychiatry', `psychology',
   `anxiety', `depression' and `stress' in various permutations and
   combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles,
   official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and
   non-government organizations, verified social media portals were
   compiled.
   Results: The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety,
   depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people,
   frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were
   among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have
   also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to
   address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and
   intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense
   in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry
   consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and
   behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India.
   Conclusion: Keeping a positive approach, developing
   vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk
   communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving
   epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning
   and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most
   vulnerable.},

Title = {Losing ground at the wrong time: trends in self-reported influenza
   vaccination uptake in Switzerland, Swiss Health Survey 2007-2017},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Objectives We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and
   associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in
   Switzerland, overall and in people aged >= 65 years. Design Three
   cross-sectional surveys. Participants Individuals who participated in
   the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the
   proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and
   performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results We
   included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49
   years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3\%). The proportion of
   reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9\% (95\% CI
   31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5\% in 2007 to 28.8\% in 2017. The
   uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16\% in 2007 and
   similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14\%). In people with chronic disease,
   uptake dropped from 43.8\% in 2007 to 37.1\% in 2012 and to 31.6\% in
   2017 (p<0.001). In people aged >= 65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8\%
   in 2007 to 38.5\% in 2012 to 36.2\% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic
   regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75
   years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and
   2012; aOR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was
   positively associated with the >= 65 age group, living in
   French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported
   health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical
   profession and having any underlying chronic disease. Conclusion
   Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill
   persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the influenza
   season 2020/2021 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal
   influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel
   approaches using social media.},

Abstract = {Due to the intellectual, physical, and emotional demands of field
   research, those doing this work need to strategies to monitor and
   maintain their own mental health before, during, and after a field
   season. Moreover, they should have a framework for supporting their
   colleagues. This review article will present a framework for assessing
   the mental health hazards and the reactions, both positive and negative,
   to fieldwork. First, it will use U.S. epidemiology to show that most
   field teams are at risk. Second, it will frame the field season both as
   a workplace and wilderness exposure event and discuss the elements of
   the field research environment that can be therapeutic for some but
   toxic for others. Third, it will discuss the psychological impacts of
   travel and reintegration as they are pertinent to the practice of
   archaeology. Research will be presented in order to guide
   evidence-informed policies for the field research team to improve the
   mental-health readiness and resiliency of the research team. Last, it
   will provide guidance on how to manage the anxiety caused by separating
   from social media platforms.},

Title = {Loddon Mallee healthcare worker COVID-19 study-protocol for a
   prospective cohort study examining the health and well-being of rural
   Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is creating immense psychosocial
   disturbance. While global, broad-based research is being conducted,
   little is known about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and
   well-being or how protective and resilience factors influence the human
   response in Australian rural and regional communities. Rural and
   regional communities often have less resources to deal with such public
   health emergencies and face additional environmental adversity.
   Healthcare workers, including those in rural and regional areas, have
   felt the immediate impacts of COVID-19 in a multitude of ways and these
   impacts will continue for years to come. Therefore, this study aims to
   describe and understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
   rural and regional healthcare workforce within the Loddon Mallee region,
   Victoria, Australia. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort of
   rural and regional healthcare workers will be recruited and followed
   over 3 years to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their
   health and well-being. Self-administered online questionnaires will be
   administered every 6 months for a 36-month period. Multiple outcomes
   will be assessed; however, the primary outcomes are emotional health and
   well-being and psychological resilience. Emotional health and well-being
   will be measured using validated instruments that will assess multiple
   domains of the emotional health and well-being continuum. Linear and
   logistic regression and latent growth curve modelling will be used to
   examine the association between baseline and follow-up participant
   emotional health, well-being and resilience while adjusting for
   potentially time-varying confounding variables. Participant
   characteristics measured at baseline will also be tested for association
   with incident health, morbidity, mortality and health service
   utilisation outcomes at follow-up. Ethics and dissemination Ethical
   approval has been obtained through the Bendigo Health Human Research
   Ethics Committee. The study findings will be disseminated through
   international conferences, international peer-reviewed journals and
   social media.},

Abstract = {Several prior studies have demonstrated the possibility of tracking the
   outbreak and spread of diseases using public tweets and other social
   media platforms. However, almost all such prior studies were restricted
   to geographically filtered English language tweets only. This study is
   the first to attempt a similar approach for Arabic language tweets
   originating from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. We
   obtained a list of commonly occurring diseases in the region from the
   Saudi Ministry of Health. We used both the English disease names as well
   as their Arabic translations to filter the stream of tweets. We acquired
   old tweets for a period spanning 29 months. All tweets were
   geographically filtered for the Middle East and the list of disease
   names in both English and Arabic languages. We observed that only a
   small fraction of tweets were in English, demonstrating that prior
   approaches to disease tracking relying on English language features are
   less effective for this region. We also demonstrate how Arabic language
   tweets can be used rather effectively to track the spread of some
   infectious diseases in the region. We verified our approach by
   demonstrating that a high degree of correlation between the occurrence
   of MERS-Coronavirus cases and Arabic language tweets on the disease. We
   also show that infectious diseases generating fewer tweets and
   noninfectious diseases do not exhibit the same high correlation. We also
   verify the usefulness of tracking cases using Twitter mentions by
   comparing against a ground truth data set of MERS-CoV cases obtained
   from the Saudi Ministry of Health.},

Abstract = {Objectives Regular HIV testing in men who have sex with men (MSM)
   enables timely entry into care and reduces the likelihood of HIV
   transmission. We aimed to assess HIV-testing behaviour and associated
   factors in MSM by urbanisation of place of residence. Design Data were
   derived from online survey ('Men \& Sexuality') in the Netherlands,
   which was mainly advertised on social media (Facebook and Instagram),
   dating websites, apps for MSM (Grindr and PlanetRomeo) and gay media.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures HIV testing was defined as recent
   (<1 year), not recent (>= 1 year) or never. Using multinominal
   regression analyses, factors associated with not recent testing and
   never testing, compared with recent testing, were assessed among MSM
   living in highly (>2500 residences/km(2)) or non-highly (<= 2500
   residences/km(2)) urbanised areas. Participants The study sample
   included 3815 MSM, currently living in the Netherlands. The mean age was
   36 years (SD 14.7), and 67.6\% were highly educated. Results In highly
   urbanised areas, 11.8\% was never and 19.8\% was not recently
   HIV-tested. In non-highly urbanised areas, this was 25.2\% and 19.6\%.
   Among MSM living in highly urbanised areas, independently associated
   with never and not recent testing were younger age, self-identification
   as bisexual, fewer sex partners, never notified of HIV and no recent
   condomless anal intercourse. Among MSM living in non-highly urbanised
   areas, lower perceived HIV severity, higher perceived HIV risk and a
   lower proportion gay friends were associated with never and not recent
   testing. Among never tested MSM, those in non-highly urbanised areas
   preferred self-sampling/self-testing over facility-based testing; those
   in highly urbanised areas preferred testing at healthcare facilities.
   Conclusions The proportion of never tested MSM was high (25\%) in
   non-highly urbanised areas in the Netherlands. MSM living in non-highly
   urbanised areas may possibly be reached with targeted approaches to
   increase HIV testing uptake such as self-testing/self-sampling
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Objectives To assess the public's knowledge, attitudes and practices
   about the novel coronavirus in Sierra Leone to inform an evidence-based
   communication strategy around COVID-19. Design Nationwide,
   cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey. Setting 56
   randomly selected communities in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone.
   Participants 1253 adults aged 18 years and older of which 52\% were men.
   Main outcome measures We calculated proportions of core indicators
   (awareness, knowledge, risk perception, practices). A composite variable
   for knowledge (based on seven variables) was created, and categorised
   into low (0-2 correct), medium (3-4) and high (5-7). Predictors of
   knowledge were analysed with multilevel ordinal regression models.
   Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices
   (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using
   multilevel logistic regression models. Results We found that 75\% of the
   respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A
   majority (70\%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared
   with 61\% of men. 60\% of men and 54\% of women had already taken action
   to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap
   and water (87\%). Radio (73\%) was the most used source for COVID-19
   information, followed by social media (39\%). Having a medium or high
   level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with
   soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95\% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high
   knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95\% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium
   knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95\% CI
   1.2 to 4.3). Conclusions This study shows that in the context of
   COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, there is a strong association between
   knowledge and practices. Because the knowledge gap differs between
   genders, regions, educational levels and age, it is important that
   messages are specifically targeted to these core audiences.},

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {Introduction Physical activity (PA) is essential to healthy mental and
   physical development in early life. However, the prevalence of physical
   inactivity, which is considered a key modifiable driver of childhood
   obesity, has reached alarming levels among European youth. There is a
   need to update the data for Spain, in order to establish if current
   measures are effective or new approaches are needed.
   Methods and analysis We present the protocol for Physical Activity,
   Sedentarism, lifestyles and Obesity in Spanish youth (PASOS). This
   observational, nationally representative, multicentre study aims to
   determine the PA levels, sedentary behaviours and prevalence of physical
   inactivity (defined as <60 min of moderate to vigorous PA per day) in a
   representative sample of Spanish children and adolescents. The PASOS
   study has recruited a representative random sample of children and
   adolescents aged 8-16 years from 242 educational centres in the 17
   `autonomous regions' into which Spain is divided. The aim is to include
   a total of 4508 youth participants and their families. Weight, height
   and waist circumference will be measured by standardised procedures.
   Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, quality of life, sleep duration, PA
   and sedentary behaviour are being measured by validated questionnaires.
   PA is measured by the Physical Activity Unit 7-item Screener. A
   representative subsample (10\% of participants) was randomly selected to
   wear accelerometers for 9 days to obtain objective data on PA. Parents
   are asked about their educational level, time spent doing PA, diet
   quality, self-perceived stress, smoking habit, weight, height, their
   child's birth weight and if the child was breast fed.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
   of the Fundacio Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain. Main findings of the
   study will be disseminated to the scientific community and to general
   public by media conferences, social media and a website.},

Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {IntroductionDizziness is one of the most common and recurring complaints
   in adults presenting at the clinic. However, its prevalence in the
   population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains unclear. We aimed to
   examine the prevalence and correlates of dizziness in a large sample of
   the Saudi population. MethodsIn this is cross-sectional study, we used
   an electronic survey, which was completed by 1.478 respondents, with a
   response rate of 84\% across five regions of Saudi Arabia. The online
   survey was launched on the Qualtrics website and distributed via social
   media channels to obtain heterogeneous responses. The study included
   adults aged >= 18 years who resided in Saudi Arabia during data
   collection. We used t-test and chi-square test for descriptive analysis
   and multiple logistic regression model to assess prevalence and
   predictors of dizziness. ResultsMore than half of the participants were
   aged between 26 years and 45 years (58.66\%). Of the participants,
   42.97\% reported having dizziness at the time of taking the survey.
   Women were less likely than men to report dizziness (OR = 0.65; CI,
   0.49, 0.87; p = 0.003). A description of the type of dizziness by age
   revealed that vertigo slightly decreased with age. Unclear vision with
   movement or blurry vision was common in young adults, whereas imbalance
   was common in older adults. A multiple regression model adjusted for
   demographic characteristics revealed a statistically significant
   association between dizziness and age group. Participants in the age
   group of 46-55 years were 1.83 times more likely to report dizziness
   compared to those aged >65 years (odds ratio = 1.83; confidence
   interval, 0.62, 5.41; p = 0.0009). DiscussionDizziness is a common
   complaint in Saudi Arabia. Future studies should elucidate the risk
   factors for and mechanisms of dizziness to help prevent falls and
   reduced quality of life.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common reason for
   hospital admission among children Methods and analysis
   The aim of the PICNIC study (Air Pollution, housing and respiratory
   tract Infections in Children: NatIonal birth Cohort Study) is to
   quantify the extent to which in-utero, infant and childhood exposures to
   ambient air pollution and adverse housing conditions are associated with
   risk of RTI admissions in children <5 years old. We will use national
   administrative data birth cohorts, including data from all children born
   in England in 2005-2014 and in Scotland in 1997-2020, created via
   linkage between civil registration, maternity and hospital admission
   data sets. We will further enhance these cohorts via linkage to census
   data on housing conditions and socioeconomic position and small
   area-level data on ambient air pollution and building characteristics.
   We will use time-to-event analyses to examine the association between
   air pollution, housing characteristics and the risk of RTI admissions in
   children, calculate population attributable fractions for ambient air
   pollution and housing characteristics, and use causal mediation analyses
   to explore the mechanisms through which housing and air pollution
   influence the risk of infant RTI admission.
   Ethics, expected impact and dissemination
   To date, we have obtained approval from six ethics and information
   governance committees in England and two in Scotland. Our results will
   inform parents, national and local governments, the National Health
   Service and voluntary sector organisations of the relative contribution
   of adverse housing conditions and air pollution to RTI admissions in
   young children. We will publish our results in open-access journals and
   present our results to the public via parent groups and social media and
   on the PICNIC website. Code and metadata will be published on GitHub.},

Abstract = {Objective To determine clinical and ethnodemographic correlates of
   serological responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
   following mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
   Design A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had
   self-isolated due to COVID-19.
   Setting University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK
   (UHBFT).
   Participants 956 healthcare workers were recruited by open invitation
   via UHBFT trust email and social media between 27 April 2020 and the 8
   June 2020.
   Intervention Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was
   tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
   antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of
   their original illness and ethnodemographic variables.
   Results Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG,
   IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall
   seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2\% (n=442/956). The
   seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3\%, 18.7\% and 8.1\%
   for IgG, IgA and IgM, respectively. IgGAM identified serological
   responses in 40.6\% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a
   negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and
   obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response
   against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were
   associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike
   glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a
   positive predictive value of 92.3\% for seropositivity in self-isolating
   individuals a time when Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 was predominant.
   Conclusions and relevance Assays employing combined antibody detection
   demonstrate enhanced seroepidemiological sensitivity and can detect
   prior viral exposure even when PCR swabs have been negative. We
   demonstrate an association between known ethnodemographic risk factors
   associated with mortality from COVID-19 and the magnitude of serological
   responses in mild-to-moderate disease.},

Abstract = {In this age of the fourth industrial revolution 4.0, the digital world
   has a plethora of data, including the internet of things, mobile,
   cybersecurity, social media, forecasts, health data, and so on. The
   expertise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is
   required to soundly evaluate the data and develop related smart and
   automated applications, These fields use a variety of machine learning
   techniques including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
   learning. The objective of the study is to present the role of
   artificial neural networks and machine learning in utilizing spatial
   information. Machine learning and AI play an increasingly important role
   in disaster risk reduction from hazard mapping and forecasting severe
   occurrences to real-time event detection, situational awareness, and
   decision assistance. Some of the applications employed in the study to
   analyze the various ANN domains included weather forecasting, medical
   diagnosis, aerospace, facial recognition, stock market, social media,
   signature verification, forensics, robotics, electronics hardware,
   defense, and seismic data gathering. Machine learning determines the
   many prediction models for problems involving classification,
   regression, and clustering using known variables and locations from the
   training dataset, spatial data that is based on tabular data creates
   different observations that are geographically related to one another
   for unknown factors and places. The study presents that the Recurrent
   neural network and convolutional neural network are the best method in
   spatial information processing, healthcare, and weather forecasting with
   greater than 90\% accuracy.},

Title = {Analysis of Tweets Containing Information Related to Rheumatological
   Diseases on Twitter},

Abstract = {Background: Tweets often indicate the interests of Twitter users. Data
   from Twitter could be used to better understand the interest in and
   perceptions of a variety of diseases and medical conditions, including
   rheumatological diseases which have increased in prevalence over the
   past several decades. The aim of this study was to perform a content
   analysis of tweets referring to rheumatological diseases. Methods: The
   content of each tweet was rated as medical (including a reference to
   diagnosis, treatment, or other aspects of the disease) or non-medical
   (such as requesting help). The type of user and the suitability of the
   medical content (appropriate content or, on the contrary, fake content
   if it was medically inappropriate according to the current medical
   knowledge) were also evaluated. The number of retweets and likes
   generated were also investigated. Results: We analyzed a total of 1514
   tweets: 1093 classified as medical and 421 as non-medical. The diseases
   with more tweets were the most prevalent. Within the medical tweets, the
   content of these varied according to the disease (some more focused on
   diagnosis and others on treatment). The fake content came from
   unidentified users and mostly referred to the treatment of diseases.
   Conclusions: According to our results, the analysis of content posted on
   Twitter in regard to rheumatological diseases may be useful for
   investigating the public's prevailing areas of interest, concerns and
   opinions. Thus, it could facilitate communication between health care
   professionals and patients, and ultimately improve the doctor-patient
   relationship. Due to the interest shown in medical issues it seems
   desirable to have healthcare institutions and healthcare workers
   involved in Twitter.},

Abstract = {The social media is becoming an increasing trend for sharing the
   thoughts, ideas, opinions, etc. based on online reviews which generates
   a tremendous amount of unstructured data (ie. User posts). For
   processing those unstructured data supervised learning algorithms are
   preferred which helps for better performance optimization. Few years
   ago, Deep Learning (DL) techniques (ie. Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)) models has become popular in
   healthcare applications by giving the rise in complicacy of the
   healthcare data. Deep Learning (DL) Techniques provides an effective and
   efficient model for data analysis by uncovering the masked patterns and
   find the meaningful information from the significant amount of health
   data whereas the traditional analytics does not able to produce within a
   stipulated period. Specifically, Deep Learning (DL) techniques consist
   of yielding good results by using the models of pattern recognition for
   social healthcare networks. The study of this paper focuses on by
   investigating the models of deep learning (DL) techniques applied to
   classify the text in social media healthcare networks. The main
   intention of this review provides an insight for training the data and
   to classify the text by analyzing and extracting the raw input and
   produce the output with the help of Natural language processing (NLP).
   Overall, the purpose of this review is to enhance the performance of the
   text classifier based on effectiveness to improve accuracy and text
   processing speed by using a suitable methodology in order produce the
   promising results in the future.},

   among middle-school adolescents in Korea},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The reported effects of digital media overuse on physical
   activity among adolescents are inconsistent. This study examined the
   association between hours of digital media use and lack of
   moderate-intensity physical exercise (mPE) according to the type of
   digital media.METHODS: This study included 1,837 middle school students
   from the iCURE (Internet user Cohort for Unbiased Recognition of gaming
   disorder in Early Adolescence) study conducted in Korea. Hours spent
   using digital media were measured by self-reported daily usage time for
   Internet games, messengers, social media, and watching game streaming on
   weekdays. Lack of mPE was defined as performing a minimum of 30 minutes
   at a time less than twice weekly. Multivariable logistic regression
   analysis stratified by sex was performed.RESULTS: Among male students,
   the group with the highest hours of using either Internet games or
   watching game streaming was more likely to lack mPE than each non-user
   group. In contrast, among male students, the group using either
   messengers or social media had a higher rate of mPE compared to each
   non-user group. Female students showed no association between hours
   spent using Internet games, messengers, social media, or watching game
   streaming and a lack of mPE.CONCLUSIONS: Among male middle school
   students in Korea, the excessive use of Internet games or watching game
   streaming was associated with a lack of mPE. Thus, guidelines should be
   established regarding adolescent use of internet games and watching game
   streaming.},

Title = {Elucidating a Silent Illness: Hepatitis B Knowledge Among Asian
   Individuals in an Urban Center},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {417-424},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Despite comprising less than 6\% of the US population, Asian
   individuals make up more than half of the approximately 1.6 million
   chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the United States. The
   purpose of this investigation was to identify characteristics associated
   with HBV knowledge in this disproportionately affected population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, multilingual survey study using convenience
   sampling was conducted in a Midwestern urban city to collect information
   on respondents' demographics, health care access, and HBV knowledge.
   Hepatitis B virus knowledge was categorized into epidemiology, natural
   history, transmission, and vaccination. Data were analyzed using
   Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. Results: Of the 174
   individuals who completed surveys, 139 (79.9\%) were Asian.
   Characteristics of univariate analyses associated with higher knowledge
   scores included younger age (18-49 years), proficiency in reading
   English, college education, current employment status, physician using
   preferred language, last physician's visit in 2018 or prior, perceived
   lack of time to see a physician, use of emergency department, prior HBV
   vaccination, prior HBV testing, higher level of self-reported knowledge
   about HBV, and acquiring health information from the Internet, messaging
   applications, friends, and family (P < .05). In the multivariable
   analysis, shorter residency in the United States (0-10 years), current
   employment status, having heard of HBV, and confidence in their HBV
   knowledge were associated with higher knowledge scores. Conclusion:
   Knowledge deficits existed in our study population regarding HBV
   transmission, vaccination, and epidemiology, while knowledge was higher
   regarding HBV natural history. Education efforts should be designed to
   improve knowledge deficits about HBV for individuals with risk factors
   using culturally sensitive Internet and social media platforms.},

Abstract = {Background:Research has demonstrated the negative impact of racism on
   health, yet the measurement of racial sentiment remains challenging.
   This article provides practical guidance on using social media data for
   measuring public sentiment.Methods:We describe the main steps of such
   research, including data collection, data cleaning, binary sentiment
   analysis, and visualization of findings. We randomly sampled 55,844,310
   publicly available tweets from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2021 using
   Twitter's Application Programming Interface. We restricted analyses to
   US tweets in English using one or more 90 race-related keywords. We used
   a Support Vector Machine, a supervised machine learning model, for
   sentiment analysis.Results:The proportion of tweets referencing racially
   minoritized groups that were negative increased at the county, state,
   and national levels, with a 16.5\% increase at the national level from
   2011 to 2021. Tweets referencing Black and Middle Eastern people
   consistently had the highest proportion of negative sentiment compared
   with all other groups. Stratifying temporal trends by racial and ethnic
   groups revealed unique patterns reflecting historical events specific to
   each group, such as the killing of George Floyd regarding sentiment of
   posts referencing Black people, discussions of the border crisis near
   the 2018 midterm elections and anti-Latinx sentiment, and the emergence
   of COVID-19 and anti-Asian sentiment.Conclusions:This study demonstrates
   the utility of social media data as a quantitative means to measure
   racial sentiment over time and place. This approach can be extended to a
   range of public health topics to investigate how changes in social and

Abstract = {In this era of `big data', there is growing recognition of the value of
   environmental, health, social and demographic data for research. Open
   government data initiatives are growing in number and in terms of
   content. Remote sensing data are finding widespread use in environmental
   research, including in low- and middle-income settings. While our
   ability to study environment and health associations across countries
   and continents grows, data protection rules and greater patient control
   over the use of their data present new challenges to using health data
   in research. Innovative tools that circumvent the need for the physical
   sharing of data by supporting non-disclosive sharing of information, or
   that permit spatial analysis without researchers needing access to
   underlying patient data can be used to support analyses while protecting
   data confidentiality. User-friendly visualizations, allowing small-area
   data to be seen and understood by non-expert audiences, are
   revolutionizing public and researcher interactions with data. The UK
   Small Area Health Statistics Unit's Environment and Health Atlas for
   England and Wales, and the US National Environmental Public Health
   Tracking Network offer good examples. Open data facilitates
   user-generated outputs, and `mash-ups', and user-generated inputs from
   social media, mobile devices and wearable tech are new data streams that
   will find utility in future studies, and bring novel dimensions with
   respect to ethical use of small-area data.},

Title = {Using multilevel regression with poststratification to obtain regional
   health estimates from a Facebook-recruited sample},
Journal = {ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: We assess the effectiveness of multilevel regression with
   poststratification (MRP) as a tool to mitigate selection bias from
   online surveys of small geographical regions.
   Methods: We collected self-reported health information from an
   Internet-based sample of adults residing within the St. Louis, MO,
   metropolitan area in 2017. We created Bayesian hierarchical models with
   three sets of predictor variables for each of six common health
   behaviors and outcomes, with results poststratified using the American
   Community Survey to estimate region and ZIP Code Tabulation Area -level
   prevalence.
   Results: When comparing MRP estimates with a population-based sample as
   a reference, we found that adjustment using MRP can reduce bias in
   prevalence estimates and provide estimates for local area prevalence. 14
   of 18 adjusted estimates were closer to the benchmark than the
   unadjusted estimates and MRP using all three covariate sets resulted in
   better overall agreement with the benchmark compared with the unadjusted
   estimates.
   Conclusions: MRP can improve prevalence estimates from self-selected
   Internet-based samples, although a nonnegligible amount of bias may
   remain. Illustrating the utility and limitations of this method will
   help researchers develop relevant estimates of the local public health
   burden, helping local health officials better understand and reduce poor
   health outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {People's health status is related to disease control, personal health,
   etc., so more attention has been paid on it. Stepping into era of
   Internet of Things (IoT), because of the emerging of all kinds of
   intelligent devices and prevalence of social media, people's health data
   can be accessed more easily. In this paper, a framework for analyzing
   regional group health persona is designed. And a prototype system is
   implemented. In addition, we did an experiment and collected vital
   individual health information from the participants' smart device and
   environment data from their social networks. Specifically, we use deep
   learning method to recognize and label their food image to measure their
   dietary status, and then classify them into groups by clustering their
   individual data with these dietary data. And analysis on their social
   environment is also given.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardio-metabolic
   dysfunctions characterised by increased fasting plasma glucose, waist
   circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides and reduction in
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Meanwhile, metabolic
   dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the new term for
   fatty liver associated with MetS. People with MetS or MAFLD have higher
   risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortalities. However,
   large-scale data on MetS and MAFLD prevalence in Malaysia is mainly
   unknown. This study aims to determine the prevalence of MetS and MAFLD
   among the general adult population in Malaysia.Methods and analysis This
   is a community-based nationwide cross-sectional study in Malaysia. The
   data collection period is from July 2023 until September 2023, with a
   planned sample size of 1296 participants. We use a two-stage
   proportionate stratified random sampling method to ensure national
   representativeness. The definition of MetS follows the Harmonised Joint
   Interim Statement in 2009. A diagnosis of MAFLD is made if a participant
   has fatty liver, defined as having a Fatty Liver Index >= 60 and has
   type 2 diabetes, a body mass index >= 23 kg/m(2), or >= 2 metabolic risk
   abnormalities. Complex sample analysis will be conducted, and the
   disease prevalence will be reported with 95\% CIs, unweighted counts and
   estimated populations.Ethics and dissemination The protocol has been
   approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of
   Health Malaysia (NMRR ID-22-02845-GUT). The findings will be
   disseminated through a formal report, policy brief, scientific
   publications, conference presentations, social media, print media and
   stakeholder engagement activities.},

Title = {Acetaminophen, antibiotics, ear infection, breastfeeding, vitamin D
   drops, and autism : an epidemiological study},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {1399-1414},
Abstract = {Background: While many studies have examined environmental risk factors
   for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), much of the research focus has been
   on prenatal or perinatal factors. Yet, the postnatal environment may
   affect the risk of ASD as well.
   Objective: To determine whether a set of five postnatal variables are
   associated with ASD. These variables are: acetaminophen exposure,
   antibiotic exposure, incidence of ear infection, decreased duration of
   breastfeeding, and decreased consumption of oral vitamin D drops.
   Materials and methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted.
   Participants were parents living in the USA with at least one biological
   child between 3 and 12 years of age. Potential participants were
   informed about the survey via postings on social media, websites, and
   listservs and were offered an opportunity to participate in a raffle as
   well. Participants were also recruited through the Interactive Autism
   Network.
   Results: There were 1,741 completed survey responses. After exclusions,
   there remained 1,001 responses associated with children with ASD (cases)
   and 514 responses associated with children who do not have ASD
   (controls). In this data set, doses of postnatal acetaminophen (adjusted
   odds ratio {[}aOR] 1.016, CI: 1.003-1.032, .0.026), courses of postnatal
   antibiotics (aOR 1.103, CI: 1.046-1.168, p<0.001), incidence of
   postnatal ear infection (aOR 1.137, Cl: 1.046-1 .236, p=0.003), and
   decreased duration of breastfeeding (aOR 0.948, CI: 0.932-0.965,
   p<0.001) are all associated with ASD when adjusted for eight demographic
   variables. A weak association between oral vitamin D drop exposure and
   ASD was also found when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics (aOR
   1.025, CI: 0.995-1.056,p=0.102).
   Conclusion: This study adds to evidence that postnatal acetaminophen
   use, postnatal antibiotic use, incidence of ear infection, and early
   weaning are associated with an increased risk of ASD. It also finds that
   postnatal oral vitamin D drops are weakly associated with ASD when
   adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a prolonged impact
   on mental health (MH); however, the long-term MH effects of the COVID-19
   pandemic remain unknown. The Serbian national survey-CoV2Soul.RS-was
   launched to document the MH status of the Serbian population following
   the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute to an international evidence
   base about MH prevalence rates during different phases of the pandemic.
   Methods and analysis This cross-sectional study was designed to collect
   a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18-65 years; estimated
   start/end-June/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household
   sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A
   battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the
   quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and
   harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted
   to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and
   QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health
   status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test
   how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study
   was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the
   perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence
   rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics.
   For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance
   and regression analyses. The hierarchical structure of the data will be
   explored using multilevel random coefficient modelling. Structural
   equation modelling will be used to investigate the indirect effects of
   personality on distress through relevant variables. Ethics and
   dissemination Ethical Committees of the Faculty of Medicine
   (1322-VII/31) and Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade (02-33/273) and
   Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad (05-27, br.893/1) approved the
   protocol. Only respondents able to provide informed consent will
   participate in the study. Research reports will be submitted to
   peer-reviewed journals and the results will be placed on the website to
   be available to funders, researchers, policy-makers and interested
   laypeople, and will be advertised through social media.},

Abstract = {Patients are becoming increasingly active consumers of health
   information on the internet with urologic concerns being no exception.
   Our objective was to explore online search trends for topics related to
   men's health and identify information-seeking patterns related to news
   and media coverage of these topics. We used Google Trends
   (http://google.com/trends) to explore search trends for various search
   terms related to men's health in the United States over a 5-year period.
   Search queries provided graphs depicting search volume as a function of
   time, geographical data, and related topics and queries. Isolated spikes
   in search volume were further explored to identify a related event.
   Erectile dysfunction was the most-searched topic over the last 5 years
   in the United States. Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia
   were the second and third most-searched topics, respectively. Other
   popular topics involved symptoms or pathologies of the testicles and
   penis. Most topics had relatively stable search volumes, with the
   exceptions of premature ejaculation and Peyronie's disease. Several
   observed spikes in search volume were attributable to singular events,
   mostly in the form of online article publications or social media posts.
   We believe it may be helpful for providers to stay informed of cultural

Title = {Protocol for EXICODE: the EXIstential health COhort DEnmark-a register
   and survey study of adult Danes},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction We established the EXIstential health COhort DEnmark
   (EXICODE) to examine how existential and spiritual needs, practices and
   orientations in a secular culture are linked to health outcomes, illness
   trajectory and overall cost of care in patients. Substantial literature
   demonstrates that existential and spiritual well-being has positive
   effects on health. While people turn to existential and spiritual
   orientations and practices during ageing, struggle with illness and
   approaching death, patients with severe illnesses like, for example,
   cancer similarly experience existential and spiritual needs. These needs
   are often unmet in secular societies leading to spiritual pain,
   unnecessary suffering, worse quality of life and higher medical costs of
   care. Methods and analysis EXICODE is a national cohort comprising a
   10\% random sample of the adult Danish population with individual-level
   register and survey data. Specific patient subgroups are oversampled to
   ensure diseased respondents. The questionnaire used in the survey
   consists of a collection of validated instruments on existential and
   spiritual constructs suited for secular culture as well as some ad hoc
   questions compiled in the comprehensive EXICODE Questionnaire. Ethics
   and dissemination The project is registered for legal and GDPR concerns
   by the University of Southern Denmark, journal number: 10.367. Ethical
   approval was not required by Danish law since EXICODE collects only
   interview, survey and register data, but due to institutional
   best-practice policy an ethical evaluation and approval were
   nevertheless obtained from the University of Southern Denmark Research
   Ethics Committee (institutional review board), journal number: 20/39546.
   The project follows The Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity
   and is carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Results
   will be disseminated widely through publications in peer-reviewed
   scientific journals, international conferences, patient societies as
   well as mass and social media.},

Abstract = {Since January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the
   SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) to be a public health emergency of
   international concern, the National Library of Medicine's (NLM's) Web
   Collecting and Archiving Working Group has been collecting a broad range
   of web-based content about the emerging pandemic for preservation in an
   Internet archive. Like NLM's other Global Health Events web collections,
   this content will have enduring value as a multifaceted historical
   record for future study and understanding of this event. This article
   describes the scope of the COVID-19 project; some of the content
   captured from websites, blogs, and social media; collecting criteria and
   methods; and related COVID-19 collecting efforts by other groups. The
   growing collection-2,500 items as of June 30, 2020-chronicles the many
   facets of the pandemic: epidemiology; vaccine and drug research; disease
   control measures and resistance to them; effects of the pandemic on
   health care institutions and workers, education, commerce, and many
   aspects of social life; effects for especially vulnerable groups; role
   of health disparities in infection and mortality; and recognition of
   racism as a public health emergency.},

Abstract = {Skin cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women younger
   than 39 years in the USA. As a female-oriented social media, Pinterest
   could be effectively used in reaching this particular demographic group
   for the purpose of skin cancer education. We analyze the visual
   characteristics of skin cancer pins, including use of human image, use
   of fear-invoking image, pin composition, color, and text legibility. We
   also explore how these visual characteristics as well as information
   richness predict Pinterest users' participative engagement. A
   combination of descriptive and predictive content analysis of 708 pins
   is conducted. The demographic characteristics of human models are
   consistent with epidemiology data. Text legibility in bodycopy is low.
   Information richness is a significant predictor of number of repins in
   all pins except pins on melanoma with human models. In the case of
   latter, pin composition, gender of human models, and fear-invoking
   images were associated with the number of repins. A number of visual
   characteristics as well as information richness significantly predict
   Pinterest users' participant engagement with pins on skin cancer. Public
   health professionals should consider these factors in creating effective
   prevention messages to be circulated on Pinterest.},

Title = {The Need for Psychiatric Treatment among Polish Users of Psychoactive
   Substances Is Increasing: This and Other Results from the Newest
   PolDrugs Survey},
Journal = {MEDICINA-LITHUANIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Background and Objectives: PolDrugs is the largest Polish naturalistic
   nationwide survey to present basic demographic and epidemiological data
   that could potentially prevent harm from illicit substances intake in
   drugs users. The most recent results were presented in 2021. The goal of
   this year's edition was to re-present the above data and compare it to
   the previous edition's data to identify and describe the differences.
   Materials and Methods: The survey included original questions about
   basic demographics, substance use, and psychiatric treatment. The survey
   was administered via the Google Forms platform and promoted via social
   media. The data was collected from 1117 respondents. Results: People of
   all ages use a variety of psychoactive substances in many situations.
   The three most commonly used drugs are marijuana,
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms. The
   most common reason for seeking professional medical help was amphetamine
   use. A total of 41.7 percent of respondents were receiving psychiatric
   treatment. The three most common psychiatric diagnoses among the
   respondents were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.
   Conclusions: Key findings include increases in the use of psilocybin and
   DMT, increases in the use of heated tobacco products, and a near
   doubling in the percentage of individuals receiving psychiatric help in
   the past two years. These issues are discussed in the discussion section
   of this paper, which also addresses the limitations to the article.},

Abstract = {Smartphone overuse can have detrimental impacts on youth mental health.
   How it may be longitudinally associated with depressive symptoms and
   functioning, and with daily momentary affect, remains to be
   investigated. A total of 3,033 young people were consecutively recruited
   from a large-scale epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong
   Kong. A subsample (n = 936) was followed-up after 1 year, with
   experience sampling data collected from 177 participants. Separate
   multivariable logistic regression models were applied to examine the
   prospective associations between smartphone overuse and depressive
   symptoms, with multilevel models fitted to examine its associations with
   momentary affect. The prevalence of smartphone overuse in the Hong Kong
   youth population was 29.3\%. Smartphone overuse was significantly
   associated with more depressive symptoms and functional impairments both
   cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The associations between
   smartphone overuse and 1-year depressive symptoms were significant, even
   when accounting for baseline symptoms, social media use, and other risk
   and protective factors. Baseline depressive symptoms, in contrast, were
   not associated with 1-year smartphone overuse after adjusting for
   baseline smartphone overuse. Smartphone overuse was also significantly
   associated with higher levels of momentary negative affect, even when
   accounting for depressive symptoms. Strategies to mitigate the impact of
   smartphone overuse can have important long-term implications.},

   community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point
   scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2279 reported a
   COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1414 negative
   (COVID-).
   Results: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever best distinguished
   COVID+ from COVID-participants (OR 6.07, 95\% CI: 4.39 to 8.47). COVID +
   subjects with BMI>30, concomitant respiratory disorders or an organ
   transplant had increased risk of moderate-to- severe dyspnoea. Race and
   anti-autoimmunity medication did not affect moderate-to-severe dyspnea
   risk.
   Conclusions: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever differentiates
   COVID-19. Elevated risks of severe symptoms outside the hospital were
   most evident among the obese and those with pulmonary comorbidity. Race
   and use of medication for autoimmune disease did not predict severe
   disease. These findings should facilitate rapid COVID-19 diagnosis and
   triage in settings without testing.},

Abstract = {In past years, communication activities have become increasingly
   important in the environment and health domain, considering the
   concurrent developments of social media and scientific citizenship that
   contributed changes in legislation and culture. Communication is
   particularly crucial where an environmental hazard is present, as in the
   case of high risk environmental and health risk areas. The project
   ``International Center of Advanced Study in Environment, Ecosystem and
   Human Health{''} (CISAS), carried out by the Italian National Research
   Council, covers multiple research activities, from ecology to biology
   and medical sciences, from epidemiology to social sciences and
   communication. Three different studies based on human biomonitoring and
   a birth cohort study are currently in progress in the project locations,
   together with studies on the environmental fate of pollutants. A clear,
   accurate and respectful communication of study protocols and results
   represents a priority to produce comprehensible information available
   for policy makers, citizens, and stakeholders. This paper describes the
   multiple external and internal communication activities planned in the
   framework of the CISAS project as an example of promotion of knowledge
   in the society at large and improvement of risk management in the
   environmental health domain.},

Abstract = {Objective Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur commonly
   in children and have been related to bullying victimization. However,
   whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are
   related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We
   used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying
   perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were
   associated with future hallucinatory experiences.
   Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based
   Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer
   acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N =
   925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions
   within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization
   was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences
   were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for
   sociodemographic covariates.
   Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively
   associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR =
   1.22, 95\% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and
   bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory
   experiences three years later than children who were not involved in
   bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim =
   1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer
   rejection networks, but not peer acceptance networks, were associated
   with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection =
   1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024).
   Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially
   rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory
   experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a
   victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable
   for psychotic experiences.},

Abstract = {Adolescents face exceptional challenges and opportunities that may have
   a lifelong impact on their consumption and personal and societal
   well-being. Parents, community members (schools and neighborhoods), and
   policymakers play major roles in shaping adolescents and influencing
   their engagement in consumption behaviors that are either
   developmentally problematic (e.g., drug use and unhealthy eating) or
   developmentally constructive (e.g., academic pursuits and
   extracurricular activities). In this article, we discuss two main
   topics: (a) the challenges and opportunities that characterize
   adolescence, based primarily on research in epidemiology and
   neuroscience, and (b) the ways that parents, community members, and
   policymakers can facilitate positive adolescent development, based on
   research from many disciplines including marketing, psychology,
   sociology, communications, public health, and education. Our goal is to
   summarize the latest scientific findings that can be used by various
   stakeholders to help adolescents navigate this turbulent period and
   become well-adjusted, thriving adults.},

Title = {Identifying COVID-19 Personal Health Mentions From Tweets Using Masked
   Attention Model},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {59068-59077},
Abstract = {Twitter has been an important platform for people to discuss and share
   health-related information. It provides a massive amount of data for
   real-time monitoring of infectious diseases (such as COVID-19) and
   freeing disease-prevention organizations from the tedious labor involved
   in public health surveillance. Personal health mention (PHM) detection
   is one of the critical methods to keep up-to-date on an epidemic's
   condition; it attempts to identify a person's health condition based on
   online text information. This paper explores PHM identification for
   COVID-19 through Twitter. We built a COVID-19 PHM data set containing
   tweets annotated with four types of COVID-19-related health conditions.
   A masked attention model was devised to classify the tweets as
   self-mention, other-mention, awareness, and non-health. We obtained
   promising results on the PHM identification task. The classification
   results facilitate timely health monitoring and surveillance for digital
   epidemiology. We also evaluate how the attention mechanism and training
   method affect the model's predictive performance.},

   Bovine Tuberculosis in a State from Brazil},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},

Abstract = {Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises
   that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological
   purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production
   chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases
   through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social
   network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns
   and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the
   movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures
   in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as
   bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and
   slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over
   the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil
   with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the
   static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade,
   (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises
   from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the
   potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the
   cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease
   transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease
   spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the
   study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly
   connected (similar to 94\%) trade network, with strong temporal trends,
   especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly
   clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential
   for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB
   transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top
   7\% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the
   total number of infected farms over three years by >50\%. In conclusion,
   the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly
   connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being
   close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having
   animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and
   betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between
   premises in RS.},

Title = {Impact of mobile phones and wireless devices use on children and
   adolescents' mental health: a systematic review},
Journal = {EUROPEAN CHILD \& ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 16},
Abstract = {Growing use of mobiles phones (MP) and other wireless devices (WD) has
   raised concerns about their possible effects on children and
   adolescents' wellbeing. Understanding whether these technologies affect
   children and adolescents' mental health in positive or detrimental ways
   has become more urgent following further increase in use since the
   COVID-19 outbreak. To review the empirical evidence on associations
   between use of MP/WD and mental health in children and adolescents. A
   systematic review of literature was carried out on Medline, Embase and
   PsycINFO for studies published prior to July 15th 2019, PROSPERO ID:
   CRD42019146750. 25 observational studies published between January 1st
   2011 and 2019 were reviewed (ten were cohort studies, 15 were
   cross-sectional). Overall estimated participant mean age and proportion
   female were 14.6 years and 47\%, respectively. Substantial between-study
   heterogeneity in design and measurement of MP/WD usage and mental health
   outcomes limited our ability to infer general conclusions. Observed
   effects differed depending on time and type of MP/WD usage. We found
   suggestive but limited evidence that greater use of MP/WD may be
   associated with poorer mental health in children and adolescents. Risk
   of bias was rated as `high' for 16 studies, `moderate' for five studies
   and `low' for four studies. More high-quality longitudinal studies and
   mechanistic research are needed to clarify the role of sleep and of type
   of MP/WD use (e.g. social media) on mental health trajectories in
   children and adolescents.},

Title = {Belarusian Healthcare Professionals' Views on Monkeypox and Vaccine
   Hesitancy},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the low transmission risk of Monkeypox (mpox) in
   Belarus, this study is vital as it contributes to our understanding of
   vaccine hesitancy among healthcare professionals (HCPs). It aims to
   assess vaccination perceptions and evaluate the willingness to pay for
   the vaccine among Belarusian HCPs, thereby enhancing pandemic
   preparedness. Methods: in October 2022, a cross-sectional survey-based
   study was conducted among Belarusian HCPs using a self-administered
   questionnaire (SAQ). Invitations were disseminated via social media
   platforms using a snowball sampling method. The SAQ encompassed various
   categories, including sociodemographic details, medical history, sources
   of mpox information, perceived and factual mpox knowledge, and
   perceptions of the mpox vaccine according to the health belief model
   (HBM), mpox vaccine acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP). Results:
   while a large proportion of respondents had good knowledge of mpox
   epidemiology and its clinical manifestations, their awareness of
   available vaccines and treatment options was limited. Consequently, a
   significant correlation was found between the history of influenza
   vaccination and mpox-related knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed
   that just over half of the participants (51.4\%) were willing to receive
   the mpox vaccine if offered for free, safely, and effectively, with
   their decision largely influenced by perceived benefits (Spearman's rho
   = 0.451) and cues to action (Spearman's rho = 0.349). However, a
   considerable degree of hesitancy (30.6\%) and resistance (18.1\%)
   towards the mpox vaccine was observed, underscoring the need for
   targeted interventions to address these issues. Conclusions: this study
   highlights a significant knowledge gap among Belarusian HCPs about mpox
   vaccines and treatments, despite a general awareness of the disease's
   epidemiology and symptoms, and it underscores the need for targeted
   interventions to enhance mpox knowledge and vaccine acceptance.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {126-134},
Month = {2022 SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review Applying text mining to suicide research holds a great
   deal of promise. In this manuscript, literature from 2019 to 2021 is
   critically reviewed for text mining projects that use electronic health
   records, social media data, and death records. Recent Findings Text
   mining has helped identify risk factors for suicide in general and
   specific populations (e.g., older adults), has been combined with
   structured variables in EHRs to predict suicide risk, and has been used
   to track trends in social media suicidal discourse following population
   level events (e.g., COVID-19, celebrity suicides). Future research
   should utilize text mining along with data linkage methods to capture
   more complete information on risk factors and outcomes across data
   sources (e.g., combining death records and EHRs), evaluate effectiveness
   of NLP-based intervention programs that use suicide risk prediction,
   establish standards for reporting accuracy of text mining programs to
   enable comparison across studies, and incorporate implementation science
   to understand feasibility, acceptability, and technical considerations.},

Title = {Attitudes and Perceptions of Health Protection Measures Against the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May
   2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an
   online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and
   personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and
   efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and
   various health protection measures enforced (third section).Methods: The
   ``health protection attitude score{''} (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by
   pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey
   tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting
   regression coefficients (RC) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%
   CI).Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were
   associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By
   contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information
   available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling
   of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of
   SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk
   mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified
   two social patterns with different features in relation to their
   attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19.
   Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines
   were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and
   increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were
   instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the
   pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism.
   Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or
   behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk
   reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge
   on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population.
   However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated
   and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an
   infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social
   media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content
   control by providers of social platforms is recommended.},

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Introduction Bullying and violence at work are relatively common in
   Finnish public sector workplaces. Previous research has demonstrated
   their association with increased risk of poor health and well-being, but
   only few intervention studies exist. The aim of this protocol paper is
   to describe the development and assessment of the effectiveness of a
   workplace intervention aimed at reducing these harmful phenomena.
   Methods and analysis This protocol describes a two-wave
   quasi-experimental intervention. Each of the three participating Finnish
   public sector organisations (cities) will select four work units (a
   total of 450-500 employees) to participate in an intervention including
   2-3 workshops for the work unit, 2-3 consultative meetings with the
   supervisor of the work unit, a follow-up meeting for the entire work
   unit (a maximum of 6-month time lag) and online meetings with the
   supervisor to monitor achievements and discuss about difficult cases, if
   any. Three age-matched, sex-matched and occupation-matched controls for
   each participants of the intervention group will be randomly selected, a
   total 1350-1500 individuals in the control group. For intervention and
   control groups, premeasurement is based on responses to a survey that
   was conducted in 2020. Postintervention measurement will be based on
   survey responses in 2022. Data will be analysed using latent change
   score modelling or difference-in-difference analysis. Ethics and
   dissemination Ethics approvals are from the Ethics committees of the
   Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district and the Finnish institute of
   Occupational Health. Results will be made available to participating
   organisations and their employees, the funder and other researchers via
   open access article in a peer-reviewed journal and subsequent reporting
   of the results via social media channels and press release to the
   public.},

Title = {High continuous positive airway pressures versus non-invasive positive
   pressure ventilation in preterm neonates: protocol for a multicentre
   pilot randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction Low pressure nasal continuous positive airway pressure
   (nCPAP) has long been the mainstay of noninvasive respiratory support
   for preterm neonates, at a constant distending pressure of 5-8 cmH2O.
   When traditional nCPAP pressures are insufficient, other modes including
   nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are used. In
   recent years, high nCPAP pressures (>= 9 cmH2O) have also emerged as an
   alternative. However, the comparative benefits and risks of these
   modalities remain unknown.Methods and analysis In this multicentre pilot
   randomised controlled trial, infants < 29 weeks' gestational age (GA)
   who either: (A) fail treatment with traditional nCPAP or (B) being
   extubated from invasive mechanical ventilation with mean airway pressure
   >= 10 cmH(2)O, will be randomised to receive either high nCPAP (positive
   end-expiratory pressure 9-15 cmH2O) or NIPPV (target mean Paw 9-15
   cmH(2)O). Primary outcome is feasibility of the conduct of a larger,
   definitive trial as assessed by rates of recruitment and protocol
   violations. The main secondary outcome is failure of assigned treatment
   within 7 days postrandomisation. Multiple other clinical outcomes
   including bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be ascertained. All randomised
   participants will be analysed using intention to treat. Baseline and
   demographic variables as well as outcomes will be summarised and
   compared using univariate analyses, and a p < 0.05 will be considered
   significant.Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the
   respective research ethics boards at each institution (McMaster
   Children's Hospital: Hamilton integrated REB approval \#2113; Royal
   Alexandra Hospital: Health Research Ethics Board approval ID
   Pro00090244; Westmead Hospital: Human Research Ethics Committee approval
   ID 2022/ETH01343). Written, informed consent will be obtained from all
   parents/guardians prior to study enrolment. The findings of this pilot
   study will be disseminated via presentations at national and
   international conferences and via publication in a peer reviewed
   journal. Social media platforms including Twitter will also be used to

Title = {Rationale and design of the CV-PREVITAL study: an Italian multiple
   cohort randomised controlled trial investigating innovative digital
   strategies in primary cardiovascular prevention},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction Prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of key
   importance in reducing morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide.
   Observational studies suggest that digital health interventions can be
   an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. However,
   evidence from large randomised clinical trials is lacking.
   Methods and analysis The CV-PREVITAL study is a multicentre,
   prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label interventional trial
   designed to compare the effectiveness of an educational and motivational
   mobile health (mHealth) intervention versus usual care in reducing CV
   risk. The intervention aims at improving diet, physical activity, sleep
   quality, psycho-behavioural aspects, as well as promoting smoking
   cessation and adherence to pharmacological treatment for CV risk
   factors. The trial aims to enrol approximately 80 000 subjects without
   overt CVDs referring to general practitioners' offices, community
   pharmacies or clinics of Scientific Institute for Research,
   Hospitalization and Health Care (Italian acronym IRCCS) affiliated with
   the Italian Cardiology Network. All participants are evaluated at
   baseline and after 12 months to assess the effectiveness of the
   intervention on short-term endpoints, namely improvement in CV risk
   score and reduction of major CV risk factors. Beyond the funded life of
   the study, a long-term (7 years) follow-up is also planned to assess the
   effectiveness of the intervention on the incidence of major adverse CV
   events. A series of ancillary studies designed to evaluate the effect of
   the mHealth intervention on additional risk biomarkers are also
   performed.
   Ethics and dissemination This study received ethics approval from the
   ethics committee of the coordinating centre (Monzino Cardiology Center;
   R1256/20-CCM 1319) and from all other relevant IRBs and ethics
   committees. Findings are disseminated through scientific meetings and
   peer-reviewed journals and via social media. Partners are informed about
   the study's course and findings through regular meetings.},

Title = {A town level comprehensive intervention study to reduce salt intake in
   China: protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Salt intake in China (approximate to 12 g/day) is more than twice the
   upper limit recommended by the WHO (5 g/day). To reduce salt intake,
   Action on Salt China (ASC) was launched in 2017. As one of four
   randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the ASC programme, a
   comprehensive intervention study was designed to test whether all the
   components of the interventions adopted by other RCTs are acceptable,
   scalable and effective when provided to a region in the real world.
   Methods and analysis
   Using a cluster RCT design, 2688 participants were selected from 48
   towns (clusters) in 12 counties in 6 provinces and assigned to the
   intervention group or the control group. Randomisation was performed
   after the baseline survey was completed. Information on salt-related
   knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP), blood pressure and 24-hour
   urinary sodium were collected. The intervention includes government
   engagement, health education and other intervention components targeting
   restaurants, home cooks and primary school students and their families
   that have been used in other RCTs. The control group will not receive
   the intervention. The project will be followed up for 2 years, with the
   intervention being carried out for the first year only. The primary
   outcome is salt intake measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion
   after 1 year. The secondary outcomes are the long-lasting effectiveness
   on salt intake and blood pressure measured by the same method, as well
   as salt-related KAP and blood pressure at the 1-year and 2-year
   follow-ups. Process evaluation and health economics analysis will be
   conducted as well.
   Ethics and dissemination
   The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of
   the National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and
   Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and
   Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated
   through presentations, publications and social media.},

Title = {Cohort profile: the British Columbia COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns
   Survey (BC-Mix)},

Abstract = {Purpose Several non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical
   distancing, handwashing, self-isolation, and school and business
   closures, were implemented in British Columbia (BC) following the first
   laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 on 26 January 2020, to minimise
   in-person contacts that could spread infections. The BC COVID-19
   Population Mixing Patterns Survey (BC-Mix) was established as a
   surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over
   time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control
   measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the
   demographic characteristics of respondents. Participants The ongoing
   repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are
   mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram,
   Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow-up survey is sent to participants
   2-4 weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are
   weighted to BC's population by age, sex, geography and ethnicity to
   obtain generalisable estimates. Additional indices such as the Material
   and Social Deprivation Index, residential instability, economic
   dependency, and others are generated using census and location data.
   Findings to date As of 26 July 2021, over 61 000 baseline survey
   responses were received of which 41 375 were eligible for analysis. Of
   the eligible participants, about 60\% consented to follow-up and about
   27\% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with healthcare
   databases. Approximately 83.5\% of respondents were female, 58.7\% were
   55 years or older, 87.5\% identified as white and 45.9\% had at least a
   university degree. After weighting, approximately 50\% were female, 39\%
   were 55 years or older, 65\% identified as white and 50\% had at least a
   university degree. Future plans Multiple papers describing contact
   patterns, physical distancing measures, regular handwashing and facemask
   wearing, modelling looking at impact of physical distancing measures and
   vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and uptake are either in progress or have
   been published.},

Abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China was
   first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31,
   2019, and the first cases were officially identified around December 8,
   2019. Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed,
   approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in
   Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the
   seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may
   provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of
   pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to
   official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using
   open-source data.
   Methods: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic
   observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China
   from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the
   Chinese search engine Baidu.
   Results: There was an increase in reports following the official
   notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report
   that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe
   pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a
   potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17.
   Conclusions: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31,
   2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship,
   given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on
   December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent
   origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22
   was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the
   first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further
   investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the
   seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been
   retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting
   that the infection was present prior to December.},

Title = {Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Patient Experiences in the United
   States: 4-Year Content Analysis of Twitter},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Background: Racial and ethnic minority groups often face worse patient
   experiences compared with the general population, which is directly
   related to poorer health outcomes within these minority populations.
   Evaluation of patient experience among racial and ethnic minority groups
   has been difficult due to lack of representation in traditional health
   care surveys.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for
   identifying racial and ethnic disparities in patient experience across
   the United States from 2013 to 2016.
   Methods: In total, 851,973 patient experience tweets with geographic
   location information from the United States were collected from 2013 to
   2016. Patient experience tweets included discussions related to care
   received in a hospital, urgent care, or any other health institution.
   Ordinary least squares multiple regression was used to model patient
   experience sentiment and racial and ethnic groups over the 2013 to 2016
   period and in relation to the implementation of the Patient Protection
   and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014.
   Results: Racial and ethnic distribution of users on Twitter was highly
   correlated with population estimates from the United States Census
   Bureau's 5-year survey from 2016 (r(2) =0.99; P<.001). From 2013 to
   2016, the average patient experience sentiment was highest for White
   patients, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and
   American Indian/Alaska Native patients. A reduction in negative patient
   experience sentiment on Twitter for all racial and ethnic groups was
   seen from 2013 to 2016. Twitter users who identified as Hispanic/Latino
   showed the greatest improvement in patient experience, with a 1.5 times
   greater increase (P<.001) than Twitter users who identified as White.
   Twitter users who identified as Black had the highest increase in
   patient experience postimplementation of the ACA (2014-2016) compared
   with preimplementation of the ACA (2013), and this change was 2.2 times
   (P<.001) greater than Twitter users who identified as White.
   Conclusions: The ACA mandated the implementation of the measurement of
   patient experience of care delivery. Considering that quality assessment
   of care is required, Twitter may offer the ability to monitor patient
   experiences across diverse racial and ethnic groups and inform the
   evaluation of health policies like the ACA.},

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake in Bangkok, Thailand:
   Cross-sectional Online Survey},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: The third most severe COVID-19 wave in the middle of 2021
   coincided with the dual challenges of limited vaccine supply and lagging
   acceptance in Bangkok, Thailand. Understanding of persistent vaccine
   hesitancy during the ``608{''} campaign to vaccinate those aged over 60
   years and 8 medical risk groups was needed. On-the-ground surveys place
   further demands on resources and are scale limited. We leveraged the
   University of Maryland COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (UMD-CTIS), a
   digital health survey conducted among daily Facebook user samples, to
   fill this need and inform regional vaccine rollout policy.Objective: The
   aims of this study were to characterize COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy,
   frequent reasons for hesitancy, mitigating risk behaviors, and the most
   trusted sources of COVID-19 information through which to combat vaccine
   hesitancy in Bangkok, Thailand during the 608 vaccine campaign.Methods:
   We analyzed 34,423 Bangkok UMD-CTIS responses between June and October
   2021, coinciding with the third COVID-19 wave. Sampling consistency and
   representativeness of the UMD-CTIS respondents were evaluated by
   comparing distributions of demographics, 608 priority groups, and
   vaccine uptake over time with source population data. Estimates of
   vaccine hesitancy in Bangkok and 608 priority groups were tracked over
   time. Frequently cited hesitancy reasons and trusted information sources
   were identified according to the 608 group and degree of hesitancy.
   Kendall tau was used to test statistical associations between vaccine
   acceptance and vaccine hesitancy.Results: The Bangkok UMD-CTIS
   respondents had similar demographics over weekly samples and compared to
   the Bangkok source population. Respondents self-reported fewer
   pre-existing health conditions compared to census data overall but had a
   similar prevalence of the important COVID-19 risk factor diabetes.
   UMD-CTIS vaccine uptake rose in parallel with national vaccination
   statistics, while vaccine hesitancy and degree of hesitancy declined
   (-7\% hesitant per week). Concerns about vaccination side effects
   (2334/3883, 60.1\%) and wanting to wait and see (2410/3883, 62.1\%) were
   selected most frequently, while ``not liking vaccines{''} (281/3883,
   7.2\%) and ``religious objections{''} (52/3883, 1.3\%) were selected
   least frequently. Greater vaccine acceptance was associated positively
   with wanting to ``wait and see{''} and negatively with ``don't believe I
   need (the vaccine){''} (Kendall tau 0.21 and -0.22, respectively;
   adjusted P<.001). Scientists and health experts were most frequently
   cited as trusted COVID-19 information sources (13,600/14,033, 96.9\%),
   even among vaccine hesitant respondents.Conclusions: Our findings
   provide policy and health experts with evidence that vaccine hesitancy
   was declining over the study timeframe. Hesitancy and trust analyses
   among the unvaccinated support Bangkok policy measures to address
   vaccine safety and efficacy concerns through health experts rather than
   government or religious officials. Large-scale surveys enabled by
   existing widespread digital networks offer an insightful
   minimal-infrastructure resource for informing region-specific health
   policy needs.},

Title = {Families' healthcare experiences for children with inherited metabolic
   diseases: protocol for a mixed methods cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction Children with inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) often
   have complex and intensive healthcare needs and their families face
   challenges in receiving high-quality, family centred health services.
   Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple
   components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This
   study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of
   children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and
   analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be
   used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter
   experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care
   map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months.
   Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis.
   Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of
   healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions
   will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative
   data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be
   summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and
   purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for
   stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one
   videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data
   regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will
   be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be
   merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care
   experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and
   presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a
   theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display.
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved
   by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board,
   the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics
   boards of each participating study centre. Findings will be published in
   peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.},

Title = {Polarity-Based Sentiment Analysis of Georeferenced Tweets Related to the

Abstract = {Twitter, one of the most important social media platforms, has been in
   the headlines regularly since its acquisition by Elon Musk in October
   2022. This acquisition has had a strong impact on the employees,
   functionality, and discourse on Twitter. So far, however, there has been
   no analysis that examines the perception of the acquisition by the users
   on the platform itself. For this purpose, in this paper, we use
   georeferenced Tweets from the US and classify them using a
   polarity-based sentiment analysis. We find that the number of Tweets
   about Twitter and Elon Musk has increased significantly, as have
   negative sentiments on the subject. Using a spatial hot spot analysis,
   we find distinct centres of discourse, but no clear evidence of their
   significant change over time. On the West Coast, however, we suspect the
   first signs of polarisation, which could be an important indication for
   the future development of discourse on Twitter.},

Title = {Knowledge and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People With Severe
   Mental Illness in Bangladesh and Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Survey},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {BackgroundPeople with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are likely to face
   disproportionate challenges during a pandemic. They may not receive or
   be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to
   limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected,
   particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MethodsWe conducted a
   telephone survey (May-June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI
   who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and
   Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries,
   socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms,
   prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing,
   hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and
   health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and
   practice using regularized logistic regression models. FindingsMass
   media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances,
   employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned
   concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following
   advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related
   quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge,
   respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge.
   Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both
   countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from
   multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In
   Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted
   poorer practice. ConclusionOur paper adds to the literature on people
   living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19
   prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and
   social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely
   gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further
   attention.},

Abstract = {At-home DNA testing has become increasingly popular due to the ability
   to be able to gain both ancestry and health information, as well as
   connect with others who share your DNA. Do users have reasonable mental
   models of how these systems work? Do users have privacy concerns and
   what do they understand as the benefits and risks involved? We conducted
   27 interviews with Canadian users of at-home DNA testing companies. Our
   interviews covered perceived and desired data use, data management, data
   sharing practices, control over data, and any regrets. Our qualitative
   analysis revealed that many users have inconsistencies in their mental
   models and liken their DNA data to their data stored with existing
   technologies, such as social media, rather than health data. They are
   generally either dismissive of privacy concerns towards themselves or
   their relatives or they had not considered privacy in their choice. We
   discuss our findings and propose possible future work in this area.},

Abstract = {Social media and in particular, microblogs are becoming an important
   data source for disease surveillance, behavioral medicine, and public
   healthcare. Topic Models are widely used in microblog analytics for
   analyzing and integrating the textual data within a corpus. This paper
   uses health tweets as microblogs and attempts the health data clustering
   by topic models. The traditional topic models, such as Latent Semantic
   Indexing (LSI), Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (PLSI), Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and
   integer Joint NMF(intJNMF) methods are used for health data clustering;
   however, they are intractable to assess the number of health topic
   clusters. Proper visualizations are essential to extract the information
   from and identifying trends of data, as they may include thousands of
   documents and millions of words. For visualization of topic clouds and
   health tendency in the document collection, we present hybrid topic
   models by integrating traditional topic models with VAT. Proposed hybrid
   topic models viz., Visual Non-negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF),
   Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual Probabilistic Latent
   Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) and Visual Latent Schematic Indexing (VLSI)
   are promising methods for accessing the health tendency and
   visualization of topic clusters from benchmarked and Twitter datasets.
   Evaluation and comparison of hybrid topic models are presented in the
   experimental section for demonstrating the efficiency with different
   distance measures, include, Euclidean distance, cosine distance, and
   multi-viewpoint cosine similarity.},

Title = {Big Data in Context: Addressing the Twin Perils of Data Absenteeism and

Abstract = {Recent advances in the collection and processing of health data from
   multiple sources at scale-known as big data-have become appealing across
   public health domains However, present discussions often do not
   thoroughly consider the implications of big data or health informatics
   in the context of continuing health disparities. The 2 key objectives of
   this paper were as follows: first, it introduced 2 main problems of
   health big data in the context of health disparities-data absenteeism
   (lack of representation from underprivileged groups) and data chauvinism
   (faith in the size of data without considerations for quality and
   contexts). Second, this paper suggested that health organizations should
   strive to go beyond the current fad and seek to understand and
   coordinate efforts across the surrounding societal-, organizational-,
   individual-, and data-level contexts in a realistic manner to leverage
   big data to address health disparities.},

Title = {Generation of False-Positive SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Results with Testing
   Conditions outside Manufacturer Recommendations: A Scientific Approach
   to Pandemic Misinformation},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Antigen-based rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) are useful tools for
   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection.
   However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2
   antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products. To offer
   a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation,
   this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with
   conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations. Using Panbio,
   various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and
   SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested with and without
   manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the
   role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and Tween 20)
   as well as the impact of temperature (4 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 45
   degrees C) and humidity (90\%) on assay performance. Direct sample
   testing (without the kit buffer) resulted in false-positive signals
   resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2 positive controls tested under
   proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is
   nonspecific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and
   capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon,
   and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under
   conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse
   engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining
   buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function.
   Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of
   temperature and humidity outside manufacturer claims. Our data support
   strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false-positive
   SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of
   public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation.
   IMPORTANCE With the Panbio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
   2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test being deployed in over 120 countries
   worldwide, understanding conditions required for its ideal performance
   is critical. Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate
   false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed.
   While erroneous results from improper use of a test may not be
   surprising to some health care professionals, understanding why false
   positives occur can help reduce the propagation of misinformation and
   provide a scientific rebuttal for these aberrant findings. This study
   demonstrated that the kit buffer's pH, ionic strength, and buffering
   capacity were critical components to ensure proper kit function and
   avoid generation of false-positive results. Typically, false positives
   arise from cross-reacting or interfering substances; however, this study
   demonstrated a mechanism where false positives were generated under
   conditions favoring nonspecific interactions between the two antibodies
   designed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Following the manufacturer
   instructions is critical for accurate test results.},

Title = {Re-emerging Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria: Re-enforcing ``One
   Health{''} community surveillance and emergency response practice},
Journal = {INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {We evaluated the impact of man-made conflict events and climate change
   impact in guiding evidence-based community ``One Health{''} epidemiology
   and emergency response practice against re-/emerging epidemics.
   Increasing evidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases
   including recent Lassa fever outbreaks in almost 20 states in Nigeria
   led to 101 deaths and 175 suspected and confirmed cases since August
   2015. Of the 75 laboratory confirmed cases, 90 deaths occurred
   representing 120\% laboratory-confirmed case fatality. The outbreak has
   been imported into neighbouring country such as Benin, where 23 deaths
   out of 68 cases has also been reported. This study assesses the current
   trends in re-emerging Lassa fever outbreak in understanding
   spatio-geographical reservoir(s), risk factors pattern and Lassa virus
   incidence mapping, inherent gaps and raising challenges in health
   systems. It is shown that Lassa fever peak endemicity incidence and
   prevalence overlap the dry season (within January to March) and reduced
   during the wet season (of May to November) annually in Sierra Leone,
   Senegal to Eastern Nigeria. We documented a scarcity of consistent data
   on rodent (reservoirs)-linked Lassa fever outbreak, weak culturally and
   socio-behavioural effective prevention and control measures integration,
   weak or limited community knowledge and awareness to inadequate
   preparedness capacity and access to affordable case management in
   affected countries. Hence, robust sub/regional leadership commitment and
   investment in Lassa fever is urgently needed in building integrated and
   effective community ``One Health{''} surveillance and rapid response
   approach practice coupled with pest management and phytosanitation
   measures against Lassa fever epidemic. This offers new opportunities in
   understanding human-animal interactions in strengthening Lassa fever
   outbreak early detection and surveillance, warning alerts and rapid
   response implementation in vulnerable settings. Leveraging on Africa CDC
   centre, advances in cloud-sourcing and social media tools and solutions
   is core in developing and integrating evidence-based and timely risk
   communication, and reporting systems in improving contextual
   community-based immunization and control decision making policy to
   effectively defeat Lassa fever outbreak and other emerging pandemics
   public health emergencies in Africa and worldwide.},

Abstract = {This study aim to assess changes in obesity and activity patterns among
   youths in China during the COVID-19 lockdown. We used the COVID-19
   Impact on lifestyle change survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective
   survey distributed via social media platforms in early May 2020 where
   more than 10 000 youth participants in China have voluntarily reported
   their basic sociodemographic information, weight status, and routine
   lifestyles in the months before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The
   extended IOTF and WHO standards were used to define overweight and
   obesity of the participants. We used paired t-tests or chi(2) tests and
   non-parametric methods to evaluate the significance of differences in
   weight-related outcomes and lifestyles across education levels, between
   sexes, and before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The mean body mass index
   of all participating youths has significantly increased (21.8-22.6) and
   in all education subgroups during COVID-19 lockdown. Increases also
   occurred in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (21.3\%-25.1\%, P
   <.001) and obesity (10.5\% to 12.9\%, P <.001) in overall youths,
   especially in high school and undergraduate students. Their activity
   patterns had also significantly changed, including the decreased
   frequency of engaging in active transport, moderate-/vigorous-intensity
   housework, leisure-time moderate-/vigorous-intensity physical activity,
   and leisure-time walking, and the increased sedentary, sleeping, and
   screen time. Our findings would inform policy-makers and clinical
   practitioners of these changes in time, for better policy making and
   clinical practice. School administrators should also be informed of
   these changes, so in-class and/or extracurricular physical activity
   programs could be designed to counteract them.},

Title = {Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in Tunisian population},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented various challenges, one of
   which is the discovery that after the acute episode, around 30\% of
   patients experience persistent symptoms or develop new ones, now known
   as long COVID. This new disease has significant social and financial
   impacts. The objective is to determine the prevalence of long COVID in
   the Tunisian population and identify its predictive factors.MethodsThis
   was a cross-sectional study conducted among Tunisians who were infected
   with COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2022. An online
   self-administered questionnaire was distributed through social media,
   radio, and television channels over the course of one month (February
   2022). Long COVID was defined as the persistence of existing symptoms or
   the development of new symptoms within three months after onset, lasting
   for at least two months, and with no differential diagnosis. We
   performed univariate and multivariate analyses using binary stepwise
   logistic regression with a significance level set at 5\%.ResultsA total
   of 1911 patients participated in our study, and the prevalence of long
   COVID was 46.5\%. The two most frequent categories were general and
   neurological post-COVID syndrome, with a prevalence of 36.7\% each. The
   most commonly observed symptoms were fatigue (63.7\%) and memory
   problems (49.1\%). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive factors
   for long COVID were female gender and age of 60 years or older, while
   complete anti-COVID vaccination was found to be a protective
   factor.ConclusionsOur study found that complete vaccination was a
   protective factor against long COVID, while female gender and age of 60
   years or older were identified as the main risk factors. These findings
   are consistent with studies conducted on other ethnic groups. However,
   many aspects of long COVID remain unclear, including its underlying
   mechanisms, the identification of which could guide the development of
   potential effective treatments.},

Title = {SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and asymptomatic viral carriage in healthcare
   workers: a cross-sectional study},
Journal = {THORAX},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {75},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1089-1094},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective
   To determine the rates of asymptomatic viral carriage and seroprevalence
   of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers.
   Design
   A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on
   24/25 April 2020.
   Setting
   University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK.
   Participants
   545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work.
   Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media.
   Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
   No potential participants were excluded.
   Intervention
   Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample
   that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike
   glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the
   context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which
   participants worked.
   Main outcome measure
   Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive
   SARS-CoV-2 serology.
   Results
   The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4\% (n=13/545).
   The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4\%
   (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had
   higher seroprevalence (37.5\% vs 17.1\%, chi(2)=21.1034, p<0.0001) and
   quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained
   asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in
   housekeeping (34.5\%), acute medicine (33.3\%) and general internal
   medicine (30.3\%), with lower rates observed in participants working in
   intensive care (14.8\%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic)
   ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of
   seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95\% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the
   intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of
   seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR:
   0.28, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02).
   Conclusions and relevance
   We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to
   SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic
   seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of
   these observations is required to inform future infection control and
   occupational health practices.},

Abstract = {Background and Aim The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
   the world has brought different attitudes and perceptions among social
   strata. Nursing students being future first-line healthcare workers are
   more at risk of being infected and exposed to various stressors from
   shared information. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the
   knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 among nursing students
   and to estimate predictors of their risk perception. Methods We
   conducted an online survey among undergraduate nursing students at three
   selected Japanese Universities. Data on knowledge, attitude, and
   perception toward COVID-19 were collected using a structured
   questionnaire. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to
   identify factors associated with the risk perception toward COVID-19
   infection. Results Of the 414 nursing students who participated in the
   study, 368 (90.4\%) reported that the media including radio, television,
   internet, and/or social media were the main source of knowledge. Fever
   (96.1\%) and dry cough (89.6\%) were reported as the main symptoms.
   Regarding the attitude toward the treatment and preventive measures,
   almost 92.8\% of participants recommended the use of vaccines. Being
   female appeared to be three times associated with the fear of getting
   infected (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR]:3.03; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 1.21-7.58). Students who took part in extracurricular activities
   reported that they feared being infected with COVID-19 (aOR:2.62; 95\%
   CI:1.33-5.16). Other factors did not show an association. Conclusion
   Knowledge and attitude of nursing students toward COVID-19 were accurate
   for the majority of them, with the main source of information being the
   media. Practicing extracurricular activities and being female were
   associated with the fear of the disease. Efficient and controlled
   communication is needed during widespread disease outbreaks.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Exploiting information in health-related social media services is of
   great interest for patients, researchers and medical companies. The
   challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the
   vast amount of information that is available. One step towards
   facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining.
   Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and
   negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine
   learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an
   extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical,
   syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings
   features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity
   classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of
   polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations).
   Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and
   research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated
   texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for
   the polarity classification of health information.
   Material and methods
   We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of
   breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each
   sentence in a post is manually labeled as ``experience{''}, ``fact{''}
   or ``opinion{''}, and as ``positive{''}, ``negative{''} and
   ``neutral{''}. Using this data, we train different machine learning
   algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with
   word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic,
   network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically
   classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral.
   Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic
   representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS
   Metathesaurus.
   Results
   We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict
   polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy
   (approximate to 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this
   considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of
   words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and
   positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as
   negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective
   information), and their importance for polarity classification is
   crucial.},

Abstract = {Objectives Primary objective: to assess nine data quality metrics for 14
   maternal and newborn health data elements, following implementation of
   an integrated, district-focused data quality intervention. Secondary
   objective: to consider whether assessing the data quality metrics beyond
   completeness and accuracy of facility reporting offered new insight into
   reviewing routine data quality. Design Before-and-after study design.
   Setting Primary health facilities in Gombe State, Northeastern Nigeria.
   Participants Monitoring and evaluation officers and maternal, newborn
   and child health coordinators for state-level and all 11 local
   government areas (district-equivalent) overseeing 492 primary care
   facilities offering maternal and newborn care services. Intervention
   Between April 2017 and December 2018, we implemented an integrated data
   quality intervention which included: introduction of job aids and
   regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback,
   learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support
   through social media. Outcome measures 9 metrics for the data quality
   dimensions of completeness and timeliness, internal consistency of
   reported data, and external consistency. Results The data quality
   intervention was associated with improvements in seven of nine data
   quality metrics assessed including availability and timeliness of
   reporting, completeness of data elements, accuracy of facility
   reporting, consistency between related data elements, and frequency of
   outliers reported. Improvement differed by data element type, with
   content of care and commodity-related data improving more than
   contact-related data. Increases in the consistency between related data
   elements demonstrated improved internal consistency within and across
   facility documentation. Conclusions An integrated district-focused data
   quality intervention-including regular self-assessment of data quality,
   peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for
   improvement, and ongoing support through social media-can increase the
   completeness, accuracy and internal consistency of facility-based
   routine data.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the creation of a knowledge base for an intelligent
   healthcare management system dealing with cases of stroke, myocardial
   infarction and depression. The main purpose of the knowledge base is to
   discover and evaluate risk factors and situations which can lead to such
   diseases, and to enable the formation and support of a preventative
   measures plan. The present version of the knowledge base is implemented
   using a heterogeneous semantic network approach and utilizes expert
   opinions about risk factors and events influencing an individual's
   health. Data includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and external
   environment. Data is compiled with the aid of questionnaires, mobile
   devices, case histories and information from social media. Information
   from social media is analyzed using data and text mining methods with
   the goal of evaluating the user's condition. All of the data obtained is
   accumulated in a single database. The knowledge base establishes risk
   factors, including changes in those factors over the course of time, and
   circumstances or events which might precipitate the emergence of
   pathology. Hypotheses are generated about the current state of the
   user's health, the active risk factors which created conditions for the
   onset of disease, and circumstances which might produce an increase or
   decrease in risk factors. Prophylactic measures to reduce those risks
   are suggested through analysis of the hypotheses generated.
   Recommendations regarding prophylactic measures are formed with the aid
   of the knowledge base, the user case-library, and collaborative
   filtering methods. Recommendations are based on 4P medicine, which
   re-quires mandatory participation of system users in maintaining their
   health. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open

   depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety
   Disorder Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; modified
   Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) above screening thresholds.
   Adjusting for multiple covariates and comorbidities, multivariable
   Poisson regression was used to assess the association between COVID-19
   severity and mental morbidities. Results Compared with individuals
   without a diagnosis of COVID-19, patients recovering from COVID-19 had
   increased risk of depression (22.1\% vs 16.2\%; adjusted relative risk
   (aRR) 1.48, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.82) and PTSD (19.5\% vs 15.6\%; aRR 1.38,
   95\% CI 1.09 to 1.75) but not anxiety (13.1\% vs 11.3\%; aRR 1.24, 95\%
   CI 0.93 to 1.64). Elevated relative risks were limited to patients
   recovering from COVID-19 that were 40 years or older and were
   particularly high among individuals with university education. Among
   patients recovering from COVID-19, symptoms of depression were
   particularly common among those in the highest, compared with the lowest
   tertile of influenza-like symptom burden (47.1\% vs 5.8\%; aRR 6.42,
   95\% CI 2.77 to 14.87), among patients confined to bed for 7 days or
   longer compared with those never confined to bed (33.3\% vs 10.9\%; aRR
   3.67, 95\% CI 1.97 to 6.86) and among patients hospitalised for COVID-19
   compared with those never admitted to hospital (48.1\% vs 19.9\%; aRR
   2.72, 95\% CI 1.67 to 4.44). Conclusions Severe disease course is
   associated with increased risk of depression and PTSD among patients
   recovering from COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Objective To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatic
   patients' and rheumatologists' usage, preferences and perception of
   digital health applications (DHAs). Methods A web-based national survey
   was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German
   Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The
   prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram
   and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were
   calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations.
   Results We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129
   rheumatologists. Most patients (74\%) and rheumatologists (76\%)
   believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and
   musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage
   thereof (90\%; 86\%). 38\% of patients and 71\% of rheumatologists
   reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and
   that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29\%; 48\%). The
   majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for
   follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported
   advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6\%;
   77.5\%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable,
   available DHAs (58.5\%; 41.9\%), poor usability (42.1\% of patients) and
   a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2\% of
   rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10\% in both groups) believed that
   digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship.
   Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients' and
   rheumatologists' acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a
   permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.},

Title = {Restaurant interventions for salt reduction in China: protocol for a
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Introduction Salt intake in China is high, and most of it comes from
   that added by consumers. Nevertheless, recent years have seen a rapid
   increase in the frequency at which people eat out. The aim of this study
   is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed for salt
   reduction in restaurants through a randomised controlled trial in China.
   Methods and analysis As a randomised controlled trial with restaurants
   as study subjects, we recruited 192 restaurants from 12 counties of 6
   provinces in China. After the baseline survey, restaurants were randomly
   assigned to intervention or control group. Using social cognitive
   theory, comprehensive intervention activities were designed to encourage
   salt reduction in all restaurant foods, and at the same time, to
   encourage consumers to choose lower salt options when eating out. The
   interventions will be conducted only in restaurants of the intervention
   group during the first year. The follow-up assessment will be conducted
   at the end of the trial. The primary outcome is the change in the
   average salt content of the five best-selling dishes of the restaurant,
   as measured by laboratory tests. Secondary outcomes include differences
   in the monthly use of salt and salty condiments between intervention and
   control restaurants, and the knowledge, attitude and practice on salt
   among restaurant consumers. Ethics and dissemination The study was
   reviewed and approved by the Review Board of the National Institute for
   Nutrition and Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
   and Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated
   through presentations, publications and social media.},

Title = {A Geo-Social Characterization of Health Impact from Air Pollution in
   Mexico Valley},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {The impact of the air pollution phenomenon has been long studied, but
   most often with a fragmented approach, without closely looking at the
   relationship between different components that characterize it, such as
   sensor-based data, health data from institutional databases, and data on
   how it is perceived by human beings in social media. The research
   developed in this study introduces an integrated methodological
   framework that analyses sensor data on air pollution distributed in
   space and time, combined with health data and social data narratives
   that reflect how different communities perceive this phenomenon in space
   and time; exploring how these different heterogeneous sources can be
   combined to better understand the impact of air pollution phenomena at
   the large-city level in the Valley of Mexico. We introduce a
   Spatio-temporal data integration and mining framework that aims to
   discover trends and insights regarding the distribution of the impact of
   an air pollution phenomenon in terms of human health and perception. The
   main peculiarity of our methodological framework is the integration of
   different large data sources by combining a series of methods: NLP
   (topic modeling), data mining (data cubes, unsupervised learning, and
   clustering), and GIS capabilities (spatial interpolation, choropleth
   maps) that together provide a better understanding of the quantitative
   and qualitative patterns emerging at a different spatial scale and
   temporal granularity. Overall, this shows how social data, when combined
   with quantitative data, can provide a better understanding of the impact
   of a given phenomenon, such as air pollution.},

Title = {Assessing disparities in medical students' knowledge and attitude about
   monkeypox: a cross-sectional study of 27 countries across three
   continents},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Background and aimsThe recent monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak confirmed by the
   World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the importance of evaluating
   the knowledge and attitude of medical students toward emerging diseases,
   given their potential roles as healthcare professionals and sources of
   public information during outbreaks. This study aimed to assess medical
   students' knowledge and attitude about Mpox and to identify factors
   affecting their level of knowledge and attitude in low-income and
   high-income countries. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on
   11,919 medical students from 27 countries. A newly-developed validated
   questionnaire was used to collect data on knowledge (14 items), attitude
   (12 items), and baseline criteria. The relationship between a range of
   factors with knowledge and attitude was studied using univariate and
   multivariate analyses. Results46\% of the study participants were males;
   10.7\% were in their sixth year; 54.6\% knew about smallpox; 84\%
   received the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine; and 12.5\% had
   training on Mpox. 55.3\% had good knowledge of Mpox and 51.7\% had a
   positive attitude towards it. Medical students in their third, fifth, or
   sixth year high- income countries who obtained information on Mpox from
   friends, research articles, social media and scientific websites were
   positive predictors for good knowledge. Conversely, being male or coming
   from high-income countries showed a negative relation with good
   knowledge about Mpox. Additionally, a positive attitude was directly
   influenced by residing in urban areas, being in the fifth year of
   medical education, having knowledge about smallpox and a history of
   receiving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Receiving
   information about Mpox from social media or scientific websites and
   possessing good knowledge about Mpox were also predictors of a positive
   attitude. On the other hand, being male, employed, or receiving a
   training program about Mpox were inversely predicting positive attitude
   about Mpox. ConclusionThere were differences in knowledge and attitude
   towards Mpox between medical students in low and high-income countries,
   emphasizing the need for incorporating epidemiology of re-emerging
   diseases like Mpox into the medical curriculum to improve disease
   prevention and control.},

Title = {Long COVID in the Belgian Defence forces: prevalence, risk factors and
   impact on quality of daily functioning},
Journal = {BMJ MILITARY HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 23},
Abstract = {IntroductionLong COVID (LC) is a medical condition first described and
   documented through anecdotes on social media by patients prior to being
   recognised by WHO as a disease. Although >50 prolonged symptoms of LC
   have been described, it remains a diagnostic challenge for military
   providers and therefore threatens operational readiness. MethodsOn 9
   September 2021, an online survey was emailed to 2192 Belgian Defence
   personnel who had previously tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 between
   17 August 2020 and 31 May 2021. A total of 718 validated responses were
   received.Descriptive analyses determined the prevalence of LC and 10
   most common symptoms and their duration following infection. In the
   explanatory analyses, risk factors related to LC were identified. To
   establish the health-related impact of LC on quality of life (HRQoL), we
   used the results from the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire.
   ResultsThe most frequent symptoms that were reported for >3 months were
   fatigue, lack of energy and breathing difficulties.47.35\% of the
   respondents reported at least one persistent symptom, while 21.87\%
   reported more than 3 symptoms lasting for at least 3 months after the
   initial COVID-19 infection. Most patients with LC suffered from symptoms
   of a neuropsychiatric nature (71.76\%).LC was significantly associated
   with obesity; pre-existing respiratory disease and blood or immune
   disorders. Physical activity of >3 hours per week halved the risk of
   LC.The total QoL is reduced in patients with LC. Considering the five
   dimensions of the questionnaire, only the self-care dimension was not
   influenced by the presence of LC. ConclusionsAlmost half of Belgian
   Defence personnel developed LC after a confirmed COVID-19 infection,
   similar to numbers found in the Belgian population. Patients with LC
   would likely benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach
   that addresses shortness of breath, fatigue and mood disturbance.},

Title = {Prevalence of frailty and pain in hospitalised adult patients in an
   acute hospital: a protocol for a point prevalence observational study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Introduction Frailty and pain are associated with adverse patient
   clinical outcomes and healthcare system costs. Frailty and pain can
   interact, such that symptoms of frailty can make pain assessment
   difficult and pain can exacerbate the progression of frailty. The
   prevalence of frailty and pain and their concurrence in hospital
   settings are not well understood, and patients with cognitive impairment
   are often excluded from pain prevalence studies due to difficulties
   assessing their pain. The aim of this study is to determine the
   prevalence of frailty and pain in adult inpatients, including those with
   cognitive impairment, in an acute care private metropolitan hospital in
   Western Australia. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational,
   single-day point prevalence, cross-sectional study of frailty and pain
   intensity of all inpatients (excluding day surgery and critical care
   units) will be undertaken. Frailty will be assessed using the modified
   Reported Edmonton Frail Scale. Current pain intensity will be assessed
   using the PainChek smart-device application enabling pain assessment in
   people unable to report pain due to cognitive impairment. Participants
   will also provide a numerical rating of the intensity of current pain
   and the worst pain experienced in the previous 24 hours. Demographic and
   clinical information will be collected from patient files. The overall
   response rate of the survey will be reported, as well as the percentage
   prevalence of frailty and of pain in the sample (separately for PainChek
   scores and numerical ratings). Additional statistical modelling will be
   conducted comparing frailty scores with pain scores, adjusting for
   covariates including age, gender, ward type and reason for admission.

Title = {Using Hawkes Processes to model imported and local malaria cases in
   near-elimination settings},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Author summary
   This paper introduces a mathematically well-founded method for
   infectious disease outbreaks known as Hawkes Processes. These
   semi-mechanistic models are relatively new to the infectious diseases
   toolkit and enable us to combine disease specific information such as
   the infectious profile with statistical rigour to recreate temporal
   disease transmission. We show that these methods are very suited to
   modelling malaria in communities close to eliminating malaria-in
   particular China and Eswatini-where we are able to disentangle the
   contribution of exogenous (external) transmission and endogenous
   (person-to-person) transmission. This is particularly important for
   developing policies when counties are approaching elimination.
   Developing new methods for modelling infectious diseases outbreaks is
   important for monitoring transmission and developing policy. In this
   paper we propose using semi-mechanistic Hawkes Processes for modelling
   malaria transmission in near-elimination settings. Hawkes Processes are
   well founded mathematical methods that enable us to combine the benefits
   of both statistical and mechanistic models to recreate and forecast
   disease transmission beyond just malaria outbreak scenarios. These
   methods have been successfully used in numerous applications such as
   social media and earthquake modelling, but are not yet widespread in
   epidemiology. By using domain-specific knowledge, we can both recreate
   transmission curves for malaria in China and Eswatini and disentangle
   the proportion of cases which are imported from those that are community
   based.},

Abstract = {In late December 2019, the World Health Organisation declared that
   pneumonia of unknown aetiology broke out in China and then expanded to
   become a pandemic. Vietnam was predicted to be one of the hardest-hit
   countries of this pandemic. However, this country has written its own
   exceptional story with a low and contained infection rate and few deaths
   on its territory. This study seeks to highlight the global significance
   of the Vietnamese response model in the fight against COVID-19. The
   study suggests that the Vietnamese Government's procedures, from central
   officials to grassroots cadre, have significance on three levels with
   comparative importance. First, attention is given to the use of tracking
   mechanisms enabled by medical surveillance and record systems. Then, the
   role of social media in educational epidemiology. Finally, we highlight
   the adjustment of Vietnamese social practices, behaviours, and cultural
   habituation, which were crucial in fighting the pandemic. These results
   of this study suggest an effective, low-cost model in combating pandemic
   which could be applied by other countries, despite a surprising, but
   sadly recurrent, the reluctance of international media to represent
   Vietnam fairly and impartially. The paper draws attention to the
   importance of Vietnam's experience in tracking systems, health, and
   education, aiming to illustrate effective measures that have global
   significance and suggest opportunities for international implementation.},

   indicating a higher susceptibility of pregnant women to contracting
   COVID-19. More than 90\% refuted that the pandemic affected their
   breastfeeding practices, nor indicated that the coronavirus was
   responsible for breastfeeding cessation. Half of the women even
   considered giving longer breastmilk because of the coronavirus. In
   contrast, women's medical counseling and social support were negatively
   affected by the lockdown. Women without previous breastfeeding
   experience and in the early postpartum period experienced a higher
   burden in terms of reduced medical counseling and support. In the
   future, more consideration and alternative supportive measures such as
   tele-visits by midwives or perinatal organizations are required for
   these women.},

Abstract = {Big data is the compilation of enormous data that arrives from diverse
   sources for instance online transaction details, social media, sensor
   data, etc. Such assortment of enormous data developed is tough to
   evaluate by conventional processing relevance's. By the development and
   upcoming latent in the healthcare business field, it is essential to
   analyze an enormous noisy data to get significant information. In
   healthcare system, the aim of this work is to evaluate the medical
   database of diabetes patients by a mixture of innovative hierarchical
   decision attention network, association rules (AR) and multiclass
   outlier classification with MapReduce framework. The association rule
   apriori algorithm in a MapReduce framework considers health data to
   create regulations. This is employed to discover the association among
   disease and their signs. This examination is made by means of UCI
   machine learning datasets of diabetes containing 50 attributes. The
   results of the proposed algorithm are offered by parameters for instance
   precision, accuracy, recall, and F-score. (C) 2021 The Korean Institute

Abstract = {Graph pattern matching, one of the most fundamental graph problems, has
   been extensively investigated in the literature. Nonetheless, existing
   efforts mostly focus on general graphs without time information, few
   studies concentrate on temporal graphs, where a relationship between two
   vertices takes place at a specific moment and lingers for some time.
   Moreover, real-world temporal networks become increasingly large, and
   are usually distributed over multiple machines. These foster the need
   for evaluating pattern matching on distributed temporal graphs. In this
   paper, we propose a new notion so-called time-respecting flow graph, in
   which all paths spreading from one vertex to another are time-respecting
   (i.e., a series of contacts with non-decreasing time), and one vertex is
   distinguished as the root from which other vertices can be reached via a
   time-respecting path. Based on this, we explore the problem of
   distributed time-respecting flow graph pattern matching on temporal
   graphs, which could be applied in many fields such as epidemiology,
   social media, national security, communication, to name just a few. We
   present a distributed baseline algorithm based on GraphX as well as an
   optimized algorithm that utilizes the properties of time-respecting flow
   graph and the analyses of distributed algorithms to boost efficiency.
   Extensive experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic data
   sets demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of our proposed
   algorithms.},

Title = {Potential risk factors for celiac disease in childhood: a case-control
   epidemiological survey},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL GASTROENTEROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {303-319},
Abstract = {Background: Celiac disease (CD) prevalence has increased significantly
   in recent decades in some developed countries. Yet the environmental
   factors in the existing literature do not appear to provide a
   satisfactory explanation for this increase.
   Objective: To determine whether nine variables are associated with CD in
   children. These variables are: incidence of ear infection before 2 years
   old, courses of antibiotics before 2 years old, duration of
   breastfeeding, vitamin D drop exposure in infancy, vitamin D supplement
   exposure between 2-3 years old, age at gluten introduction into the
   diet, fat content of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, quantity
   of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, and type of water consumed
   at 2 years old.
   Methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted among parents living in
   the US with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years old.
   Potential participants were informed about the survey through social
   media, websites, electronic newsletters, and advertisements.
   Results: After exclusions, there remained 332 responses associated with
   children with CD (cases), and 241 responses associated with children who
   do not have CD (controls). In this data set, skim milk as the primary
   form of liquid cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}aOR]=3.556, CI=1.430-10.22, P=0.010), vitamin D drops
   administered for more than 3 months (aOR=1.749, CI=1.079-2.872,
   P=0.025), courses of antibiotics (aOR=1.133, CI=1.037-1.244, P=0.007),
   and incidence of ear infection (aOR=1.183, CI=1.041-1.348, P=0.010) are
   all associated with CD in children.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to find an association between skim
   milk consumption and CD and vitamin D drop use for greater than 3 months
   and CD. It also adds to evidence that early life exposure to antibiotics
   and early life infection, specifically ear infection, are associated
   with CD.},

Abstract = {In order to reduce gender dysphoria and combat stigma, transgender women
   often affirm their gender through social and medical transition, which
   may include cross-sex hormone therapy. This study examined associations
   between medically monitored hormone use and hormone misuse
   (non-prescribed hormone use including ``fillers{''}), structural
   inequities (access to housing, health insurance, and income), and social
   network dynamics among 271 transgender women in Los Angeles. Hormone use
   status was coded trichotomously (hormone use, hormone misuse, no hormone
   use), and robust multinomial logistic regression as well as novel social
   network analysis was conducted to examine associations. Results
   demonstrated that younger, African-American/Black transgender women were
   most likely to engage in hormone misuse compared to transgender women
   who were older or non-African-American/Black. One-third of the sample
   reported sex work as a main source of income, and this group was more
   likely to misuse hormones than those with another primary source of
   income. Transgender women with access to stable housing and health
   insurance were most likely to engage in medically monitored hormone use.
   Social network analysis revealed that transgender women with a greater
   number of hormone-using network alters were most likely to misuse
   hormones, but that using the Internet to find transgender friends
   mitigated this association. Results demonstrate the multifaceted risk
   profile of transgender women who use and misuse hormones, including that
   social networks play an important role in hormone usage among
   transgender women.},

Title = {Using Days Alive and Out of Hospital to measure inequities and possible
   pathways for them after cardiovascular surgery in Aotearoa New Zealand:
   study protocol for a secondary data analysis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {IntroductionIn Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), socioeconomic status and being
   of Maori ethnicity are often associated with poorer health outcomes,
   including after surgery. Inequities can be partially explained by
   differences in health status and health system biases are hypothesised
   as important factors for remaining inequities. Previous work identified
   inequities between Maori and non-Maori following cardiovascular surgery,
   some of which have been identified in studies between 1990 and 2012.
   Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) is an emerging surgical outcome
   metric. DAOH is a composite measure of outcomes, which may reflect
   patient experience and longer periods of DAOH may also reflect extended
   interactions with the health system. Recently, a 1.1-day difference in
   DAOH was observed between Maori and non-Maori at a hospital in NZ across
   a range of operations. Methods and analysisWe will conduct a secondary
   data analysis using data from the National Minimum Data Set, maintained
   by the Ministry of Health. We will report unadjusted and risk-adjusted
   DAOH values between Maori and non-Maori using direct risk
   standardisation. We will risk adjust first for age and sex, then for
   each of deprivation (NZDep18), levels of morbidity (M3 score) and
   rurality. We will report DAOH values across three time periods, 30, 90
   and 365 days and across nine deciles of the DAOH distribution (0.1-0.9
   inclusive). We will interpret all results from a Kaupapa Maori research
   positioning, acknowledging that Maori health outcomes are directly tied
   to the unequal distribution of the social determinants of health. Ethics
   and disseminationEthics approval for this study was given by the
   Auckland Health Research Ethics Committee. Outputs from this study are
   likely to interest a range of audiences. We plan to disseminate our
   findings through academic channels, presentations to interested groups
   including Maori-specific hui (meetings), social media and lay press.},

Title = {Improvement for most, but not all: changes in newspaper coverage of
   mental illness from 2008 to 2019 in England},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Aims
   Time to Change, an anti-stigma programme in England, has worked to
   reduce stigma relating to mental illness in many facets of life.
   Newspaper reports are an important factor in shaping public attitudes
   towards mental illnesses, as well as working as a barometer reflecting
   public opinion. This study aims to assess the way that coverage of
   mental health topics and different mental illnesses has changed since
   2008.
   Method
   Articles covering mental health in 18 different newspapers were
   retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days of each
   month in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. A content
   analysis approach using a structured coding framework was used to
   extract information from the articles. Logistic regression models were
   used to estimate the change in odds of each hypothesised stigmatising or
   anti-stigmatising element occurring in 2019 compared to 2008 and 2016
   with a Wald test to assess the overall significance of year as a
   predictor in the model. Further logistic regression models were used to
   assess the association between the diagnosis that an article was about
   and the odds that it was stigmatising, and whether this relationship is
   moderated by year of publication.
   Results
   A total of 6731 articles were analysed, and there was a significant
   increase in anti-stigmatising articles in 2019 compared to 2008 (OR 3.16
   (2.60-3.84), p < 0.001) and 2016 (OR 1.40 (1.16-1.69), p < 0.001). Of
   the 5142 articles that specified a diagnosis, articles about
   schizophrenia were 6.37 times more likely to be stigmatising than
   articles about other diagnoses (OR 6.37 (3.05-13.29) p < 0.001), and
   there was evidence that the strength of this relationship significantly
   interacted with the year an article was published (p = 0.010). Articles
   about depression were significantly less likely to be stigmatising (OR
   0.59 (0.69-0.85) p = 0.018) than those about other diagnoses, while
   there was no difference in coverage of eating disorders v. other
   diagnoses (OR 1.37 (0.67-2.80) p = 0.386); neither of these
   relationships showed an interaction with the year of publication.
   Conclusion
   Anti-stigma programmes should continue to work with newspapers to
   improve coverage of mental illness. However, interventions should
   consider providing specific guidance and promote awareness of rarer
   mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, and evaluation should examine
   whether reductions in stigma extend to people with all mental illness
   diagnoses.},

Title = {Quantifying audio visual alcohol imagery in popular Indian films: a
   content analysis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives Though exposure to alcohol imagery in films is a significant
   determinant of uptake and severity of alcohol consumption among young
   people, there is poor evidence regarding the content of alcohol imagery
   in films in low-income and middle-income countries. We have measured
   alcohol imagery content and branding in popular Indian films, in total
   and in relation to language and age rating.
   Design In this observational study we measured alcohol imagery
   semiquantitatively using 5-minute interval coding. We coded each
   interval according to whether it contained alcohol imagery or brand
   appearances.
   Setting India.
   Participants None. Content analysis of a total of 30 national box office
   hit films over a period of 3years from 2015 to 2017.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures To assess alcohol imagery in
   Indian films and its distribution in relation to age and language rating
   has been determined.
   Results The 30 films included 22 (73\%) Hindi films and 8 (27\%) in
   regional languages. Seven (23\%) were rated suitable for viewing by all
   ages (U), and 23 (77\%) rated as suitable for viewing by children
   subject to parental guidance for those aged under 12 (UA). Any alcohol
   imagery was seen in 97\% of the films, with 195 of a total of 923
   5-minute intervals, and actual alcohol use in 25 (83\%) films, in 90
   (10\%) intervals. The occurrence of these and other categories of
   alcohol imagery was similar in U-rated and UA-rated films, and in Hindi
   and local language films. Episodes of alcohol branding occurred in 10
   intervals in five films.
   Conclusion Almost all films popular in India contain alcohol imagery,
   irrespective of age rating and language. Measures need to be undertaken
   to limit alcohol imagery in Indian films to protect the health of young
   people, and to monitor alcohol imagery in other social media platforms
   in future.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess changes in dietary patterns among youths in China
   after COVID-19 lockdown. Design: This study was based on the COVID-19
   Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective
   survey established in early May 2020. The questionnaire was distributed
   through social media platforms. The sociodemographic information and
   routine dietary patterns before and after lockdown of participants were
   investigated. t tests and chi (2) tests were used to compare the
   differences in consumption patterns of twelve major food groups and
   beverages between sex and across educational levels before and after
   lockdown. Factor analysis was employed to obtain the main dietary
   patterns. Settings: China. Participants: A total of 10 082 youths.
   Results: A significant decrease was observed in the average weekly
   frequency of rice intake, while significant increases were observed in
   the frequency of intake of wheat products, other staple foods, fish,
   eggs, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit and dairy
   products (all P values < 0 center dot 01). Heterogeneities of average
   weekly frequency existed between sex and across educational levels to
   different extents. The three main dietary patterns derived were loaded
   most heavily on dairy products, rice and wheat products, separately; the
   rice pattern became more dominant than the wheat products pattern after
   lockdown. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had
   decreased, while the frequency of other beverages had increased.
   Conclusions: Our timely survey would inform policymakers and health
   professionals of these significant changes in youths' dietary patterns
   after lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents
   between sex and across educational levels, for better policy-making and
   public health practice.},

   adults with cancer},
Journal = {CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {2022 APR},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the behavior of
   adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. No data exists on how
   gender influences the adherence of individuals with cancer to COVID-19
   related public health guidelines and their preferred methods of
   receiving COVID-19 related information.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young
   adults with cancer. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.
   Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence
   to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred
   information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and
   women.
   Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative
   measures was 44.9-58.8\% for males and 53.4-68.1\% for females. After
   adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males
   were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR {[}adjusted
   odds ratio] 1.45, 95\% CI {[}confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not
   touching face (AOR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR
   1.93, 95\% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive
   information from their cancer institutes and social media.
   Discussion: Gender-specific interventions are needed to improve the
   adherence of males to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Information
   should be disseminated via cancer institutes and social media as these
   are the preferred sources of COVID-19 related information among AYAs
   with cancer.},

Abstract = {Background: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) comprise over 90\% of the world's
   congenital anomalies and cause significant disability worldwide, while
   disproportionally burdening low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Research can help inform strategies that reduce disparities in accessing
   CLP care. We performed a scientometric analysis of CLP research in LMICs
   to identify influential contributors and themes.
   Methods: The authors searched seven citation databases accessed via Web
   of Science, from inception to March 2, 2021. Social network analysis was
   done using VOSviewer. The Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were
   used.
   Results: In total, 1561 articles authored by 6414 researchers affiliated
   with 2113 organizations in 119 countries were included. Most authors (n
   = 6387, 99.6\%) had published two or more articles. The USA (454
   articles), Brazil (211 articles), China (175 articles), and India (127
   articles) published the most. The most prolific institutions were the
   University of Sao Paulo (94 articles), the University of Pittsburgh (57
   articles), and the University of Iowa (55 articles). Marazita ML (33
   articles), Shi B (27 articles), and Murray JC (22 articles) had the
   highest number of publications. An estimated 510 articles (32.7\%) were
   focused on epidemiology, 240 (15.4\%) on management, and 54 (3.5\%) on
   global plastic surgery for CLP.
   Conclusions: LMICs are disproportionally burdened by CLP, but research
   is limited and often produced by high-income countries. This study
   elucidates partnership and health system strengthening opportunities to
   improve LMIC research capacity and ultimately informs the management and
   outcomes for patients with CLP.},

Title = {Capturing COVID-19-Like Symptoms at Scale Using Banner Ads on an Online
   News Platform: Pilot Survey Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Background: Identifying new COVID-19 cases is challenging. Not every
   suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other
   equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations
   increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during
   the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of
   people sheltering in place.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using
   an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report
   COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors.
   Methods: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related
   symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads
   offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were
   experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and
   whether they traveled outside of their local area.
   Results: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a
   3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3\% of the responses from
   the United States and 32.0\% from Japan. Of the total respondents,
   19,631 (22.3\%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19.
   Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1\%) reported more than one
   COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for
   COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7\% vs
   21.5\%; P<.001).
   Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19
   testing rates (R-2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically
   diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half
   of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age.
   Conclusions: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study
   participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at
   scale and with populations that are older than those found through
   social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and
   researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially
   before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing
   and/or treatment.},

Month = {2021 DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: Structural inequities may impact the relationship between
   COVID-19 and access to contraception. Methods: In July 2020 and January
   2021, we used social media to survey 2 samples of women of reproductive
   age who had not been surgically sterilized and were not currently
   pregnant about their experiences seeking contraception. We explore
   whether experiences differed for people experiencing social and/or
   economic disadvantage due to COVID-19, using multivariable logistic
   regression to control for age, education and income. Results: In July
   2020, 51.5\% of respondents who sought contraception (total N = 3064)
   reported barriers to care compared to 55.3\% in January 2021 (total N =
   2276). A larger percent (14\% in July 2020 and 22\% in Jan 2021)
   reported not using their preferred method of contraception due to
   COVID-19. Individuals experiencing income loss (OR = 1.61, 95\% CI
   1.27-2.04 early in the COVID-19 pandemic and OR = 1.58, 1.21-2.06 mid
   COVID-19 pandemic) and hunger (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.40 early and OR = 2.02,
   1.55-2.64 mid-COVID-19 pandemic) were more likely to report they would
   be using a different method if not for COVID-19, compared to respondents
   without income loss or hunger. Conclusions: COVID-19 has complicated
   access to contraception, especially for disadvantaged populations.
   Implications: Effort s are needed to ensure access to contraception
   despite the COVID-19 epidemic, especially for disadvantaged populations.

Title = {The portrayal and perceptions of cesarean section in Mexican media
   Facebook pages: a mixed-methods study},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Plain Language Summary Cesarean section is a medical intervention that
   can save women and babies when there are complications during pregnancy
   or birth. Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean section in the
   world (45\%); much higher than what we would expect. We do not fully
   understand why this is happening, but we think social influences are
   important. We know that traditional and social media are important
   social influences on health and health-seeking behaviors in other
   countries. In our study, we aimed to explore how cesarean section is
   portrayed in Facebook Mexican media pages, and how people (Facebook
   users) interacted with these articles. To do this, we identified the
   most popular Facebook media pages in Mexico. Next, we searched for all
   articles posted to these pages. We found 80 articles and studied them to
   understand how they discussed cesarean section. We found that media
   articles posted on Facebook did not encourage women to have cesarean
   section, and they correctly showed risks and consequences. Then, we
   explored the comments from Facebook users that were attached to these
   posts about cesarean section. We found 6350 comments, and classified
   each comment based on the what the Facebook users said. Lastly, we
   connected the main themes of the articles to the types of comments. We
   found that Facebook users distrusted the Mexican health system, rejected
   information about the consequences of cesarean section, and often
   responded with the content with sexist and aggressive comments against
   women. Our research shows that while there is accurate and useful
   information on social media about cesarean section, other social issues
   like gender inequality and violence may influence pregnancy and
   childbirth.
   Background Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean sections
   globally at over 45\%. There is limited research about social factors
   influencing these rates. This study explores the portrayal and
   perceptions of cesarean section in Facebook media pages to better
   understand the socio-cultural context of childbirth in Mexico. Methods
   This is a mixed-methods social media analysis using two data sources.
   First, to study the portrayal of cesarean section, we identified ten
   Mexican media Facebook pages with the largest audiences (based on number
   of page ``likes{''}). We searched these pages for articles containing
   the word ``cesarea{''} (Spanish for cesarean section), and posts
   (articles) were eligible for inclusion if they contained the word
   ``cesarea{''}. Second, to understand perceptions of cesarean section
   portrayal, we extracted comment threads of each Facebook post sharing
   the included articles. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of
   articles and a quantitative content analysis of comments. Results We
   included 133 Facebook posts depicting 80 unique articles and identified
   three major themes: (1) information about cesarean section, (2)
   inequality and violence against women, (3) governance failures. Cesarean
   section was portrayed as a lifesaving procedure when medical necessary,
   and riskier than vaginal birth, with a longer recovery time, and
   possible negative health consequences. We extracted comments from 133
   Facebook posts, and 6350 comments were included. We inductively
   developed 20 codes to then classify comments under six major categories:
   (1) violence and discrimination, (2) health and health services, (3)
   mode of birth choice, (4) disbelief at information about cesarean
   section, (5) abortion, and (6) discontent at the government. Conclusions
   We found that Facebook media did not promote cesarean section over
   vaginal birth, and risks and consequences were mostly represented
   reliably. Perceptions about the portrayal of cesarean section showed
   strong discontent and distrust against providers and the health system,
   as well as rejection of factual information about the consequences of
   cesarean section. We documented gross gender inequality and violence
   against women, highlighting the urgent need for human rights approaches
   to maternal health to address these inequalities and prevent harmful
   practices. Our study also contributes to the emerging field of social
   media analysis, and demonstrates clear areas where social media
   communication can be improved.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: COVID-19 causes moderate to severe illness and is spreading
   globally. During a pandemic, vitamins and minerals are vital to health.
   Therefore, the prevalence and epidemiology of supplement use in Saudi
   Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic must be known. Methods: This
   cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online
   survey. The study was con-ducted from June to March 2022 on both adults
   and children. The link to the survey was shared on social media
   platforms. The survey included questions on participants' demographics,
   vaccination status, supplements they used, and side effects of
   supplements. Participation in this study was optional, and there was no
   obligation to participate. There was a declaration about the aim of the
   study and different objectives before starting the survey. Results: The
   present study reported that most of the participants reported that they
   used vitamin C (64.6 \%), zinc (51.9 \%), multivitamins (46.1 \%), black
   seeds (26.7 \%), garlic (Allium sativum) (15.4 \%), omega-3 (22.1 \%),
   vitamin D (22.2 \%), echinacea (10.1 \%), manuka honey (26.0 \%),
   curcumin (13.6 \%), ginger (22.5 \%), royal jelly (12.9 \%), and
   propolis (7.5 \%) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. These
   supplements were used more frequently by subjects during the pandemic
   than before. Discussion and conclusion: The respondents' risk of these
   supplements' use may partially reflect the public's behavioral response
   during a pandemic. Future studies can document the health beliefs and
   motivations of nutritional supplement users.},

Abstract = {BackgroundNutrition is an area of apparent disagreement among the public
   and experts. It is also an area which has seen a rapid increase in the
   number of publications in the past 40 years. With the advent of online
   media and social media platforms, the volume of news has also increased.
   This review considered five types of nutrition research and how press
   releases linked to publications might be reported by the media.
   MethodsExamples were taken from nutrition-related articles published in
   the areas of in vitro work, animal data, epidemiology, clinical trials
   and data modelling publications which had press releases deposited in
   online repositories (EurekAlert! and AlphaGalileo). A critical narrative
   of the source of the media message, estimates of its reach and any
   potential exaggeration or source of confusion were identified. ResultsIt
   was clear that research has been reported by funders, journals and
   researchers' institutions in ways that claim extended findings of the
   data beyond that reported in the manuscript. This included inferences of
   health benefits in humans from laboratory studies, splitting outcome
   data for the same exposure in epidemiological studies based on perceived
   public interest, using clinical trials to make media claims that would
   not be permitted in advertisements and claiming modelled data for cases
   were actual changes in numbers of cases. ConclusionsIt is essential that
   funding bodies and institutions along with academic journals apply
   pressure to discourage exaggeration of research. This is necessary to
   maintain public trust in science and ultimately improve public health.},

Abstract = {Every internet search query made out of curiosity by anyone who observed
   something in nature, as well as every photo uploaded to the internet,
   constitutes a data point of potential use to scientists. Researchers
   have now begun to exploit the vast online data accumulated through
   passive crowdsourcing for studies in ecology and epidemiology. Here, we
   demonstrate the usefulness of iParasitology, i.e. the use of internet
   data for tests of parasitological hypotheses, using hairworms (phylum
   Nematomorpha) as examples. These large worms are easily noticeable by
   people in general, and thus likely to generate interest on the internet.
   First, we show that internet search queries (collated with Google
   Trends) and photos uploaded to the internet (specifically, to the
   iNaturalist platform) point to parts of North America with many
   sightings of hairworms by the public, but few to no records in the
   scientific literature. Second, we demonstrate that internet searches
   predict seasonal peaks in hairworm abundance that accurately match
   scientific data. Finally, photos uploaded to the internet by
   non-scientists can provide reliable data on the host taxa that hairworms
   most frequently parasitize, and also identify hosts that appear to have
   been neglected by scientific studies. Our findings suggest that for any
   parasite group likely to be noticeable by non-scientists, information
   accumulating through internet search activity, photo uploads, social
   media or any other format available online, represents a valuable source
   of data that can complement traditional scientific data sources in
   parasitology.},

Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility
   datasets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records,
   and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These datasets have
   fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of
   mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban
   planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature
   addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal
   trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering
   the statistical ``laws{''} that govern human movements. A significant
   effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic
   trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human
   mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial
   problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the
   re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on
   state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical
   software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the
   aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we
   propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of
   providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze
   mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is
   efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library
   for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many
   functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic
   data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk
   related to the analysis of mobility datasets.},

Abstract = {Objectives. To examine prevalence and predictors of digital health
   engagement among the US population. Methods. We analyzed nationally
   representative cross-sectional data on 7 digital health engagement
   behaviors, as well as demographic and socioeconomic predictors, from the
   Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycle 2, collected
   in 2018; n = 2698-3504). We fitted multivariable logistic regression
   models using weighted survey responses to generate population estimates.
   Results. Digitally seeking health information (70.14\%) was relatively
   common, whereas using health apps (39.53\%) and using a digital device
   to track health metrics (35.37\%) or health goal progress (38.99\%) were
   less common. Digitally communicating with one's health care providers
   (35.58\%) was moderate, whereas sharing health data with providers
   (17.20\%) and sharing health information on social media (14.02\%) were
   uncommon. Being female, younger than 65 years, a college graduate, and a
   smart device owner positively predicted several digital health
   engagement behaviors (odds ratio range = 0.09-4.21; Conclusions. Many
   public health goals depend on a digitally engaged populace. These data
   highlight potential barriers to 7 key digital engagement behaviors that
   could be targeted for intervention. (Am J Public},

Abstract = {Introduction: The epidemiology of injured patients has changed, with an
   increasing predominance of severe injury and deaths in older (65 years
   and above) patients after low falls. There is little evidence of the
   models of care that optimise outcomes for injured older patients. This
   study aims to describe clinician perspectives of existing models of
   acute care for injured older patients in Australia and New
   Zealand.Methods: This cross-sectional online survey of healthcare
   professionals (HCP) managing injured older patients in Australia or New
   Zealand hospitals was conducted between November 2nd and December 12th,
   2020. Recruitment was via survey link and snowball sampling to
   professional organisations and special interest groups via email and
   social media. HCP were asked, using a Likert scale, how likely four
   typical case vignettes were to be admitted to one of twelve options for
   ongoing care. Additional questions explored usual care
   components.Results: Participants (n = 157) were predominantly Australian
   medical professionals in a major trauma service (MTS) or metropolitan
   hospital. The most common age defining ``geriatric{''} was aged 65 years
   and older (43\%). HCP described variability in the models and components
   of acute care for older injured pa-tients in Australia and New Zealand.
   As a component of care, cognitive, delirium and frailty screening are
   occurring (60\%, 61\%, 46\%) with HCP from non-major trauma services
   (non-MTS) reporting frailty and cog-nitive impairment screening more
   likely to occur in the emergency department (ED). Access to an acute
   pain service was more likely in a MTS. Participants described poor
   likelihood of a geriatrician (highest 16\%) or physician (highest 12\%)
   review in EDConclusion: Despite a low response rate, HCP in Australia
   and New Zealand describe variability in acute care pathways for injured
   older patients. Given the change in epidemiology of injury towards older
   pa-tients with low force mechanisms, models of acute injury care should
   be evaluated to define a cost-effective model and components of care
   that optimise patient-centred outcomes relevant to injured older
   patients. HCP described some factors they perceive to determine care,
   and outcomes of variability, offer-ing guidance for future research and
   resource allocation in the Australia and New Zealand trauma system.(c)

Abstract = {Introduction and hypothesis Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of
   inherited connective tissue disorders associated with abnormal collagen,
   and is more prevalent in women than in men. The aim of this
   cross-sectional study was to characterize pelvic floor symptoms in
   cisgender women with EDS and to describe their impact on quality of
   life. Methods An online questionnaire on obstetric and gynecological
   experiences of cisgender women with EDS was disseminated through EDS
   patient societies and social media. This study was a sub-analysis of the
   broader questionnaire and focused on pelvic floor disorders, whereby
   self-reported symptoms and validated questionnaires were used to assess
   pelvic floor symptom severity (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory,
   PFDI-20), impact on quality of life (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire,
   PFIQ-7), and sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI-6).
   Groups based on age and EDS type were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and
   Chi-squared tests. Results A total of 1,303 participants were included
   in the analysis. Pelvic floor symptom prevalence included: stress
   urinary incontinence in 60\%, urgency urinary incontinence in 54\%,
   fecal incontinence in 24\%, and pelvic organ prolapse in 21\%. Bladder
   symptoms were reported to be the most bothersome. The impact of prolapse
   symptoms on quality of life was higher in women under age 40 than in
   older participants (p<0.001). Pelvic pain was reported in 71\%. Pain
   ratings were highest for dysmenorrhea, muscle and joint pain, and
   backache (median 7 out of 10 for each). Almost half of participants
   screened positive for possible sexual dysfunction and 36\% reported
   dyspareunia more than half the time. Conclusions This large,
   observational study demonstrated that cisgender women with EDS report a
   high prevalence of pelvic floor symptoms that appear to be more severe
   than in the general population.},

Abstract = {Internet of medical things (IoMT) has made it possible to collect
   applications and medical devices to improve healthcare information
   technology. Since the advent of the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19)
   in 2019, public health information has become more sensitive than ever.
   Moreover, different news items incorporated have resulted in differing
   public perceptions of COVID-19, especially on the social media platform
   and infrastructure. In addition, the unprecedented virality and changing
   nature of COVID-19 makes call centres to be likely overstressed, which
   is due to a lack of authentic and unregulated public media information.
   Furthermore, the lack of data privacy has restricted the sharing of
   COVID-19 information among health institutions. To resolve the
   above-mentioned limitations, this paper is proposing a privacy
   infrastructure based on federated learning and blockchain. The proposed
   infrastructure has the potentials to enhance the trust and authenticity
   of public media to disseminate COVID-19 information. Also, the proposed
   infrastructure can effectively provide a shared model while preserving
   the privacy of data owners. Furthermore, information security and
   privacy analyses show that the proposed infrastructure is robust against
   information security-related attacks.},

   the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Design We conducted a cross sectional
   survey of HCWs (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians
   (EMTs), non-clinical staff) during May 2020. Participants completed a
   42-item survey assessing disease transmission risk (clinical role, work
   environment, availability of personal protective equipment) and mental
   health (anxiety, depression and burn-out). Setting The questionnaire was
   disseminated over various social media platforms. 3083 respondents from
   48 states, the District of Columbia and US territories accessed the
   survey. Participants Using a convenience sample of HCWs who worked
   during the pandemic, 3083 respondents accessed the survey and 2040
   participants completed at least 80\% of the survey. Primary outcome
   Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 infection, in addition to burn-out,
   depression and anxiety symptoms. Results Participants were largely from
   the Northeast and Southern USA, with attending physicians (31.12\%),
   nurses (26.80\%), EMTs (13.04\%) with emergency medicine department
   (38.30\%) being the most common department and specialty represented.
   Twenty-nine per cent of respondents met the criteria for being a
   probable case due to reported COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. HCWs
   in the emergency department (31.64\%) were more likely to contract
   COVID-19 compared with HCWs in the ICU (23.17\%) and inpatient settings
   (25.53\%). HCWs that contracted COVID-19 also reported higher levels of
   depressive symptoms (mean diff.=0.31; 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.47), anxiety
   symptoms (mean diff.=0.34; 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.52) and burn-out (mean
   diff.=0.54; 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.71). Conclusion HCWs have experienced
   significant physical and psychological risk while working during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the urgent need for
   increased support for provider physical and mental health well-being.},

Abstract = {BackgroundShift work, which often results in sleep deprivation and
   circadian desynchrony, has been associated with increased risk of
   multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed at studying the impact of sleep
   duration, circadian disruption and sleep quality on MS risk. MethodsWe
   used a Swedish population-based case-control study (2075 cases, 3164
   controls). Aspects of sleep were associated with MS risk by calculating
   OR with 95\% CIs using logistic regression models. ResultsCompared with
   sleeping 7-9 hours/night during adolescence, short sleep (<7
   hours/night) was associated with increased risk of developing MS (OR
   1.4, 95\% OR 1.1-1.7). Similarly, subjective low sleep quality during
   adolescence increased the risk of subsequently developing MS (OR 1.5,
   95\% CI 1.3 to 1.9), whereas phase shift did not significantly influence
   the risk. Our findings remained similar when those who worked shifts
   were excluded. ConclusionsInsufficient sleep and low sleep quality
   during adolescence seem to increase the risk of subsequently developing
   MS. Sufficient restorative sleep at young age, needed for adequate
   immune functioning, may be a preventive factor against MS.},

Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {In Ethiopia, the magnitude of violence against girls during COVID-19 in
   the study area is not known. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
   violence and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic among Gondar
   city secondary school girls in North West Ethiopia. An institution-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2021. Data
   were collected from four public and two private Gondar city secondary
   schools. Investigators used stratified simple random sampling to select
   participants and the investigators used roster of the students at
   selected schools. Investigators collected the data using self-reported
   history of experiencing violence (victimisation). Investigators analysed
   data using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression.
   Investigators invited a total of 371 sampled female students to complete
   self-administered questionnaires. The proportion of girls who
   experienced violence was 42.05\% and psychological violence was the
   highest form of violence. Having a father who attended informal
   education (AOR = 1.95, 95\% CI 1.08-3.51), ever use of social media 1.65
   (AOR = 1.65, 95\% CI 1.02-2.69), ever watching sexually explicit
   material (AOR = 2.04, 95\% CI 1.24-3.36) and use of a substance (AOR =
   1.92, 95\% CI 1.17-3.15) were significantly associated variables with
   violence. Almost for every five girls, more than two of them experienced
   violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prevalence of violence might
   be under reported due to desirability bias. Therefore, it is better to
   create awareness towards violence among substance users, fathers with
   informal education and social media including user females.},

Abstract = {Birth defects contribute up to 21\% of the mortality in those under 5
   years of age in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and that burden
   has been compounded by the Zika virus epidemic. In 2001, the March of
   Dimes launched a series of biennial assemblies called the International
   Conference on Birth Defects and Disabilities in the Developing World
   (ICBD). The latest ICBD, in 2017, convened in Bogota, Colombia, and was
   attended by over 300 professionals, policymakers, and donors. The
   conference attendees, a majority of whom were from LAC, supported a call
   to action in the form of a consensus statement. The consensus statement
   lists key actions for maximizing birth defects surveillance, prevention,
   and care in LAC: 1) improving surveillance; 2) reducing risks for birth
   defects; 3) fortifying staple foods; 4) preventing and treating
   infections associated with birth defects; 5) implementing newborn
   screening; 6) providing care and services for people with birth defects
   and disabilities; 7) involving governments, civil society, and
   international agencies; and 8) advancing research for birth defects.
   Implementation and scale-up of evidence-based interventions using
   multisectoral and multidisciplinary collaborative approaches were
   endorsed. LAC countries can leverage technology and social media to
   advance and advocate for approaches identified in the consensus
   statement. The consensus statement can be used as a guide by both
   governments and nongovernmental agencies to take immediate steps for
   improving the quality of life of those living with birth defects and
   associated disabilities in the LAC countries.},

Abstract = {Background: An international collaborative study was conducted to
   determine the demographic and clinical profiles of Hispanic/Latinx
   endometriosis patients from Latin America and Spain using the Minimal
   Clinical Questionnaire developed by the World Endometriosis Research
   Foundation (WERF) Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonization
   Project (EPHect). Methods: This is a cross-sectional study to collect
   self-reported data on demographics, lifestyle, and endometriosis
   symptoms of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients from April 2019 to
   February 2020. The EPHect Minimal Clinical Questionnaire (EPQ-M) was
   translated into Spanish. Comprehension and length of the translated
   survey were assessed by Spanish-speaking women. An electronic link was
   distributed via social media of endometriosis patient associations from
   11 Latin American countries and Spain. Descriptive statistics
   (frequency, means and SD, percentages, and proportions) and correlations
   were conducted using SPSSv26. Results: The questionnaire was completed
   by 1,378 participants from 23 countries; 94.6\% had self-reported
   diagnosis of endometriosis. Diagnostic delay was 6.6 years. Most
   participants had higher education, private health insurance, and were
   employed. The most common symptoms were back/leg pain (85.4\%) and
   fatigue (80.7\%). The mean number of children was 1.5; 34.4\% had
   miscarriages; the mean length of infertility was 3.7 years; 47.2\%
   reported pregnancy complications. The most common hormone treatment was
   oral contraceptives (47.0\%). The most common comorbidities were
   migraines (24.1\%), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (22.2\%), and
   irritable bowel syndrome (21.1\%). Most participants (97.0\%)
   experienced pelvic pain during menses; for 78.7\%, pain was severe;
   86.4\% reported dyspareunia. The mean age of dysmenorrhea onset was 16.2
   years (SD +/- 6.1). Hormone treatments were underutilized, while impact
   was substantial. Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly
   correlated with pain intensity (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the
   first comprehensive effort to generate a clinical-demographic profile of
   Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients. Differences in clinical
   presentation compared to other cohorts included higher prevalence and
   severity of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia and high levels of pain
   catastrophizing. Though future studies are needed to dissect the impact
   of race and ethnicity on pain and impact, this profile is the first step
   to facilitate the recognition of risk factors and diagnostic features
   and promote improved clinical management of this patient population. The
   EPHect questionnaire is an efficient tool to capture data to allow
   comparisons across ethnicities and geographic regions and tackle
   disparities in endometriosis research.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn 2016, the UK Chief Medical Officers revised their guidance
   on alcohol and advised women to abstain from alcohol if pregnant or
   planning pregnancy. Midwives have a key role in advising women about
   alcohol during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate UK
   midwives' practices regarding the 2016 Chief Medical Officers Alcohol
   Guidelines for pregnancy, and factors influencing their implementation
   during antenatal appointments.MethodsOnline cross-sectional survey of a
   convenience sample of UK midwives recruited through professional
   networks and social media. Data were gathered using an anonymous online
   questionnaire addressing knowledge of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines for
   pregnancy; practice behaviours regarding alcohol assessment and advice;
   and questions based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to
   evaluate implementation of advising abstinence at antenatal booking and
   subsequent antenatal appointments.ResultsOf 842 questionnaire
   respondents, 58\% were aware of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines of whom 91\%
   (438) cited abstinence was recommended, although 19\% (93) cited
   recommendations from previous guidelines. Nonetheless, 97\% of 842
   midwives always or usually advised women to abstain from alcohol at the
   booking appointment, and 38\% at subsequent antenatal appointments. Mean
   TDF domain scores (range 1-7) for advising abstinence at subsequent
   appointments were highest (indicative of barriers) for social influences
   (3.65 sd 0.84), beliefs about consequences (3.16 sd 1.13) and beliefs
   about capabilities (3.03 sd 073); and lowest (indicative of
   facilitators) for knowledge (1.35 sd 0.73) and professional role and
   identity (1.46 sd 0.77). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the
   TDF domains: beliefs about capabilities (OR=0.71, 95\% CI: 0.57, 0.88),
   emotion (OR=0.78; 95\%CI: 0.67, 0.90), and professional role and
   identity (OR=0.69, 95\%CI 0.51, 0.95) were strong predictors of midwives
   advising all women to abstain from alcohol at appointments other than at
   booking.ConclusionsOur results suggest that skill development and
   reinforcement of support from colleagues and the wider maternity system
   could support midwives' implementation of alcohol advice at each
   antenatal appointment, not just at booking could lead to improved
   outcomes for women and infants. Implementation of alcohol care pathways
   in maternity settings are beneficial from a lifecourse perspective for
   women, children, families, and the wider community.},

Title = {SARS-CoV-2 infections in migrants and the role of household
   overcrowding: a causal mediation analysis of Virus Watch data},

Abstract = {BackgroundMigrants are over-represented in SARS-CoV-2 infections
   globally; however, evidence is limited for migrants in England and
   Wales. Household overcrowding is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
   with migrants more likely to live in overcrowded households than UK-born
   individuals. We aimed to estimate the total effect of migration status
   on SARS-CoV-2 infection and to what extent household overcrowding
   mediated this effect. MethodsWe included a subcohort of individuals from
   the Virus Watch prospective cohort study during the second SARS-CoV-2
   wave (1 September 2020-30 April 2021) who were aged \& GE;18 years,
   self-reported the number of rooms in their household and had no evidence
   of SARS-CoV-2 infection pre-September 2020. We estimated total, indirect
   and direct effects using Buis' logistic decomposition regression
   controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, clinical vulnerability, occupation,
   income and whether they lived with children. ResultsIn total, 23 478
   individuals were included. 9.07\% (187/2062) of migrants had evidence of
   infection during the study period vs 6.27\% (1342/21 416) of UK-born
   individuals. Migrants had 22\% higher odds of infection during the
   second wave (total effect; OR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.47). Household
   overcrowding accounted for approximately 36\% (95\% CI -4\% to 77\%) of
   these increased odds (indirect effect, OR 1.07, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.12;
   proportion accounted for: indirect effect on log odds scale/total effect
   on log odds scale=0.36). ConclusionMigrants had higher odds of
   SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave compared with UK-born
   individuals and household overcrowding explained 36\% of these increased
   odds. Policy interventions to reduce household overcrowding for migrants
   are needed as part of efforts to tackle health inequalities during the
   pandemic and beyond.},

Abstract = {Inference procedures for spatial autocorrelation statistics assume that
   the underlying configurations of spatial units are fixed. However,
   sometimes this assumption can be disadvantageous, for example, when
   analyzing social media posts or moving objects. This article examines
   for the case of point geometries how a change from fixed to random
   spatial indexes affects inferences about global Moran's I, a popular
   spatial autocorrelation measure. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Matern
   and Thomas cluster processes are studied and for each of these
   processes, 10,000 random point patterns are simulated for investigating
   three aspects that are key in an inferential context: the null
   distributions of I when the underlying geometries are varied; the effect
   of the latter on critical values used to reject null hypotheses; and how
   the presence of point processes affects the statistical power of Moran's
   I. The results show that point processes affect all three
   characteristics. Inferences about spatial structure in relevant
   application contexts may therefore be different from conventional
   inferences when this additional source of randomness is taken into
   account.},

Title = {Automated Social Text Annotation With Joint Multilabel Attention

Abstract = {Automated social text annotation is the task of suggesting a set of tags
   for shared documents on social media platforms. The automated annotation
   process can reduce users' cognitive overhead in tagging and improve tag
   management for better search, browsing, and recommendation of documents.
   It can be formulated as a multilabel classification problem. We propose
   a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an
   attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which
   can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better
   document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels.
   The network separately models the title and the content of each document
   and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each
   sentence. To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two
   semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption,
   which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics.
   The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as
   the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN). We conducted a
   comprehensive evaluation study and compared JMAN to the state-of-the-art
   baseline models, using four large, real-world social media data sets. In
   terms of F-1, JMAN significantly outperformed bidirectional gated
   recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) relatively by around 12.8\%-78.6\% and the
   hierarchical attention network (HAN) by around 3.9\%-23.8\%. The JMAN
   model demonstrates advantages in convergence and training speed. Further
   improvement of performance was observed against latent Dirichlet
   allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). When applying the
   semantic-based loss regularizers, the performance of HAN and Bi-GRU in
   terms of F-1 was also boosted. It is also found that dynamic update of
   the label semantic matrices (JMAN(d)) has the potential to further
   improve the performance of JMAN but at the cost of substantial memory
   and warrants further study.},

Abstract = {Contagion processes have been widely studied in epidemiology and life
   science in general, but their implications are largely tangible in other
   research areas, such as in network science and computational social
   science. Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the
   study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its
   applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing
   campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic
   networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place
   when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some
   of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish
   papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in
   their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider
   that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon
   involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in
   scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered
   those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is
   generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in
   bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge,
   information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different
   meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper,
   we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of
   inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show
   its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors,
   papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large
   bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used
   as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic
   ranking applications.},

Title = {Weight-related Self-monitoring App Use Among Emerging Adults is
   Cross-sectionally Associated With Amount and Type of Physical Activity
   and Screen Time},
Journal = {INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Weight-related self-monitoring (WRSM) apps are often used by emerging
   adults to assist in behavior change. However, little is known about the
   relationship between WRSM among the general population of emerging
   adults and various physical activity and screen time behaviors. This
   paper examines associations between WRSM app use and various forms of
   physical activity and screen time among a population-based sample of
   emerging adults. Data come from EAT 2018 (N = 1,568, mean age = 22.0 +/-
   2.0 years), a population-based sample of emerging adults from
   Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants reported on the types of
   WRSM apps used (physical activity and/or dietary focused), in addition
   to how much time they spent doing physical activity, whether they
   practiced yoga, compulsive exercise, recreational screen time, social
   media use, and whether they viewed dieting/weight loss materials. Linear
   and logistic regressions were used to assess adjusted means and
   prevalences of outcomes. We found that physical activity-focused WRSM
   app users engaged in more hours of total (8.7 vs 7.2, P < .001), and
   moderate-to-vigorous (5.1 vs 4.3, P = .002) physical activity compared
   to non-users. Similar results were found for dietary WRSM app users
   compared to non-users. However, WRSM app users had higher levels of
   compulsive exercise and were more likely to view dieting/weight loss
   materials (Ps < .001). Findings suggest that although physical activity
   is higher among WRSM users, the types of physical activity and screen
   time behaviors WRSM users are engaging in may be harmful.},

Title = {The association between information technology sophistication and
   patient portal use: A cross sectional study in Eastern North Carolina},
Journal = {HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Even with the extolled benefits of patient portals, there has been some
   challenges to ensuring patient portal use. This study examines if a
   patient's level of information technology (IT) sophistication, defined
   as the degree of use of diverse information technologies by an
   individual, is associated with their use of a patient portal. Patients
   previous experience and exposure to other similar technologies like
   desktop computer, laptop, internet, smart phone, or social media
   explains their willingness to use information technology for their
   health. Data on a cross-sectional survey of 565 individuals in Eastern
   NC was available for analysis. Multinomial regression analyses revealed
   that IT sophistication is important in determining whether patients will
   use a patient portal. It specifies that patients with low IT
   sophistication compared to those with high IT sophistication were more
   likely to have never activated their patient portals (RRR = 2.2155, p <
   0.009), or to have activated but never used a patient portal (RRR =
   3.5869, p < 0.010). The findings of this study should aid healthcare
   leaders as they strive to improve patient engagement. They should
   continue to promote the benefits of the patient portal and consider
   offering personalized support programs for patients with low IT
   sophistication.},

Abstract = {The present study examined the long-term effects of the COVID-19
   pandemic on adolescent internalizing symptoms, substance use, and
   digital media use before and during the pandemic. A nationally
   representative longitudinal cohort of 3718 Israeli adolescents aged
   12-16 at baseline completed measures of internalizing symptoms (anxiety,
   depression, and somatization), the prevalence of substance use (i.e.,
   previous 30-day use of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis), and average
   daily use of internet/television, video games, and social media. Social
   support and daily routines were assessed as potential protective factors
   for mental health. Data were collected in 10 public schools at four
   measurement points: before the Covid-19 outbreak (September 2019), after
   the first wave lockdown (May 2020), after the third wave lockdown (May
   2021), and after the fifth wave of the pandemic (May 2022). Multi-level
   mixed models were used to analyze the longitudinal data. The results
   showed significant increases in internalizing symptoms, substance use
   (tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis), and daily screen time from the start
   of the study to the 33-month follow-up. Social support and daily
   routines moderated the increases in internalizing symptoms and digital
   media use. These findings highlight the need for public and educational
   mental health services to address the continuing impact of the pandemic
   on adolescents.},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public
   health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic. This study is the first
   to assess its mental health impact across the lifespan in the United
   States in adolescents, adults, and health care workers.
   Methods: We recruited 4909 participants through an online survey
   advertising on Facebook and Instagram to assess exposure to COVID-19 and
   psychiatric symptoms from April 27 to July 13. We also recruited through
   the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,
   and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes
   were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and
   grief reactions since COVID-19.
   Results: Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate
   to severe symptoms of depression (55\% vs. 29\%; chi(2) = 122, df = 1; p
   < .001), anxiety (48\% vs. 29\%; chi(2) = 73; df = 1; p < .001), PTSD
   (45\% vs. 33\%; chi(2) = 12; df = 1; p < .001), suicidal ideation or
   behavior (38\% vs. 16\%; chi(2) = 117; df = 1; p < .001), and sleep
   problems (69\% vs. 57\%; chi(2) = 26; df = 1; p < .001) compared to
   adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost
   someone to COVID-19 was 55\%. Loneliness was the most common predictor
   across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and
   exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and
   suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents.
   Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased rates of
   clinically significant psychiatric symptoms. Loneliness could put
   individuals at increased risk for the onset of psychiatric disorders.},

Title = {Characterizing the Differences in Descriptions of Violence on Reddit
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {15-16},

Abstract = {Concerns have been raised over the experiences of violence such as
   domestic violence (DV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Social media such as Reddit represent an alternative
   outlet for reporting experiences of violence where healthcare access has
   been limited. This study analyzed seven violence-related subreddits to
   investigate the trends of different violence patterns from January 2018
   to February 2022 to enhance the health-service providers' existing
   service or provide some new perspective for existing violence research.
   Specifically, we collected violence-related texts from Reddit using
   keyword searching and identified six major types with supervised machine
   learning classifiers: DV, IPV, physical violence, sexual violence,
   emotional violence, and nonspecific violence or others. The increase
   rate (IR) of each violence type was calculated and temporally compared
   in five phases of the pandemic. The phases include one pre-pandemic
   phase (Phase 0, the date before February 26, 2020) and four pandemic
   phases (Phases 1-4) with separation dates of June 17, 2020, September 7,
   2020, and June 4, 2021. We found that the number of IPV-related posts
   increased most in the earliest phase; however, that for COVID-citing IPV
   was highest in the mid-pandemic phase. IRs for DV, IPV, and emotional
   violence also showed increases across all pandemic phases, with IRs of
   26.9\%, 58.8\%, and 28.8\%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic to the
   first pandemic phase. In the other three pandemic phases, all the IRs
   for these three types of violence were positive, though lower than the
   IRs in the first pandemic phase. The findings highlight the importance
   of identifying and providing help to those who suffer from such violent
   experiences and support the role of social media site monitoring as a
   means of informative surveillance for help-providing authorities and
   violence research groups.},

Abstract = {Typical spatial disease surveillance systems associate a single address
   to each disease case reported, usually the residence address. Social
   network data offers a unique opportunity to obtain information on the
   spatial movements of individuals as well as their disease status as
   cases or controls. This provides information to identify visit locations
   with high risk of infection, even in regions where no one lives such as
   parks and entertainment zones. We develop two probability models to
   characterize the high-risk regions. We use a large Twitter dataset from
   Brazilian users to search for spatial clusters through analysis of the
   tweets' locations and textual content. We apply our models to both
   real-world and simulated data, demonstrating the advantage of our models
   as compared to the usual spatial scan statistic for this type of data.

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need
   for coordinated mechanisms to respond to the outbreak across health
   sectors, and digital health solutions have been identified as promising
   approaches to address this challenge. This editorial discusses the
   current situation regarding digital health solutions to fight COVID-19
   as well as the challenges and ethical hurdles to broad and long-term
   implementation of these solutions. To decrease the risk of infection,
   telemedicine has been used as a successful health care model in both
   emergency and primary care. Official communication plans should promote
   facile and diverse channels to inform people about the pandemic and to
   avoid rumors and reduce threats to public health. Social media platforms
   such as Twitter and Google Trends analyses are highly beneficial to
   model pandemic trends as well as to monitor the evolution of patients'
   symptoms or public reaction to the pandemic over time. However,
   acceptability of digital solutions may face challenges due to potential
   conflicts with users' cultural, moral, and religious backgrounds.
   Digital tools can provide collective public health benefits; however,
   they may be intrusive and can erode individual freedoms or leave
   vulnerable populations behind The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the
   strong potential of various digital health solutions that have been
   tested during the crisis. More concerted measures should be implemented
   to ensure that future digital health initiatives will have a greater
   impact on the epidemic and meet the most strategic needs to ease the
   life of people who are at the forefront of the crisis.},

Abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The spread of infectious diseases due to travel and trade
   can be seen throughout history, whether from early settlers or traveling
   businessmen. Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to
   quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread
   infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks.SARS, MERS, swine
   flu, and COVID19.has demonstrated that the causative viruses were
   circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first
   detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact
   tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection
   of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures
   are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel
   technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection
   of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies
   chronologically from prehuman predictive technologies to
   population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize
   artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and
   zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to
   identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can
   also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various
   publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than
   traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring
   infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or
   wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots
   inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection
   risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has
   begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased
   sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to
   precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total
   infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas
   can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally,
   as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic
   technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification
   become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can
   allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual
   diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more
   intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many
   promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single
   technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A
   combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would
   offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks
   and pandemics.},

Title = {Global Research on Coronaviruses: Metadata-Based Analysis for Public
   Health Policies},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper
   suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on
   coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles
   founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of
   scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public
   health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of
   this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify
   critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions.
   We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in
   implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of
   developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the
   EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access
   to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their
   associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a
   theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories:
   conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of
   our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques
   (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results:
   Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated
   the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to
   public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the
   United States and China were the primary contributors to global
   coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated
   that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a
   secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong
   between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven
   approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and
   relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policy
   makers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their
   decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for
   effective health responses.},

Abstract = {Tobacco smoking with a water pipe or hookah is increasing globally.
   There are millions of water pipe tobacco smokers worldwide, and in the
   United States, water pipe use is more common among youth and young
   adults than among adults. The spread of water pipe tobacco smoking has
   been abetted by the marketing of flavored tobacco, a social media
   environment that promotes water pipe smoking, and misperceptions about
   the addictive potential and potential adverse health effects of this
   form of tobacco use. There is growing evidence that water pipe tobacco
   smoking affects heart rate, blood pressure regulation, baroreflex
   sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, and vascular function over the short
   term. Long-term water pipe use is associated with increased risk of
   coronary artery disease. Several harmful or potentially harmful
   substances present in cigarette smoke are also present in water pipe
   smoke, often at levels exceeding those found in cigarette smoke. Water
   pipe tobacco smokers have a higher risk of initiation of cigarette
   smoking than never smokers. Future studies that focus on the long-term
   adverse health effects of intermittent water pipe tobacco use are
   critical to strengthen the evidence base and to inform the regulation of
   water pipe products and use. The objectives of this statement are to
   describe the design and operation of water pipes and their use patterns,
   to identify harmful and potentially harmful constituents in water pipe
   smoke, to document the cardiovascular risks of water pipe use, to review
   current approaches to water pipe smoking cessation, and to offer
   guidance to healthcare providers for the identification and treatment of
   individuals who smoke tobacco using water pipes.},

Title = {Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccination Likelihood Among Reproductive-Aged
   Women in the United States},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Number = {3},
Pages = {588-596},
Month = {2022 MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives: Vaccination for COVID-19 is an effective method of
   preventing complications; however, studies suggest that public attitudes
   toward the vaccine are heterogeneous. The objective of our study was to
   identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among
   women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low
   intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to
   better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19
   vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January
   2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of
   reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary
   outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of
   unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was
   concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected
   from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression
   models and controlled for respondents' sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health
   insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US
   region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of
   reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater
   among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants.
   Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the
   strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95\% CI, 2.02-3.79).
   Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy and concerns may exacerbate existing
   COVID-19 health disparities in racial and ethnic groups and highlight
   the need to target messaging to specific populations, including pregnant
   and breastfeeding women, because these populations are at high risk for
   COVID-19 complications.},

   a national cross-sectional survey},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective Teenage pregnancies and childbirths are associated with
   negative health outcomes. Access to health information enables
   adolescents to make appropriate decisions. However, the relationship
   between access to health information through mass media and teenage
   pregnancy has not received much attention in existing literature. We
   therefore examined the association between access to mass media and
   teenage pregnancy in Zambia. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Zambia.
   Participants Weighted sample of 3000 adolescents aged 15-19 years.
   Outcome measure Teenage pregnancy that included adolescents who were
   currently pregnant or had had an abortion or had given birth in the last
   5 years preceding the survey. Results Out of 3000 adolescents, 897
   (29.9\%, 95\% CI: 28.1\% to 31.3\%) were pregnant or had ever been
   pregnant. Majority of the adolescents resided in rural areas (55.9\%)
   and had secondary education (53.6\%). Adolescents who had exposure to
   internet, newspapers or magazines, radio and television were 10.5\%,
   22.6\%, 43.1\% and 43.1\%, respectively. Adolescents who had daily
   access to newspapers or magazines (adjusted OR (AOR): 0.33, 95\% CI:
   0.13 to 0.82) or using internet (AOR: 0.54, 95\% CI: 0.30 to 0.95) were
   less likely to be pregnant or to have had a pregnancy compared with
   those with no access to newspapers and internet, respectively.
   Conclusion Our study suggests that internet use and reading of
   newspapers or magazines may trigger behavioural change as an effective
   approach to reducing teenage pregnancy. Behavioural change communicators
   can implement mass media campaigns using newspapers, magazines and the
   internet to publicise adolescent health messages that can encourage
   adolescents to adopt healthy behaviours and prevent teenage pregnancies.},

   convenience sample, collected by email/social media to health care
   organizations. Participants answered an online anonymous survey in March
   2021.
   Results: Mean age of 3052 respondents was 42.1 years old, 83.6\% were
   female and 77.8\% provided direct health care to COVID-19 patients. Mean
   time of use per shift was 6-8 hours in 40.8\% of the participants.
   28.0\% reported never changing it during their shift. Resp use (vs Mask)
   was more associated with discomfort (58.2\% vs 26.8\%), affecting task
   performance (41.5 vs 18.9\%) and communication (55.0 vs 40.9\%), dyspnea
   (36.0 vs 14.4\%), skin rash (37.5 vs 19.4\%) and headache (37.5 vs
   19.4\%). Frequent user errors included touching the front while in use
   (70.1\% Mask vs 66.3\% Resp) and omitting hand hygiene before (61.8\%
   Mask vs 55.0\% Resp) or after use (61.3\% Mask vs 57.0\% Resp). Average
   number of errors was higher for Mask (4.3), than for Resp (3.2) (all: P
   <.001).
   Conclusions: Most HCP admitted an extended use of Mask/Resp. Resp were
   more prone to adverse effects and Mask more prone to errors. Strategies
   to reinforce good practices should be considered. (C) 2021 Association

Month = {2021 MAY},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing, and the innovative and efficient
   contributions of the emerging modern technologies to the pandemic
   responses are too early and cannot be completely quantified at this
   moment. Digital technologies are not a final solution but are the tools
   that facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response. In accordance,
   mobile applications, robots and drones, social media platforms (such as
   search engines, Twitter, and Facebook), television, and associated
   technologies deployed in tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak are
   discussed adequately, emphasizing the current-state-of-art. A collective
   discussion on reported literature, press releases, and organizational
   claims are reviewed. This review addresses and highlights how these
   effective modern technological solutions can aid in healthcare
   (involving contact tracing, real-time isolation monitoring/ screening,
   disinfection, quarantine enforcement, syndromic surveillance, and mental
   health), communication (involving remote assistance, information
   sharing, and communication support), logistics, tourism, and
   hospitality. The study discusses the benefits of these digital
   technologies in curtailing the pandemic and `how' the different sectors
   adapted to these in a shorter period. Social media and television's role
   in ensuring global connectivity and serving as a common platform to
   share authentic information among the general public were summarized.
   The World Health Organization and Governments' role globally in-line
   with the prevention of propagation of false news, spreading awareness,
   and diminishing the severity of the COVID-19 was discussed. Furthermore,
   this collective review is helpful to investigators, health departments,
   Government organizations, and policymakers alike to facilitate a quick
   and effective pandemic response.},

Title = {COVID-19: Guidelines for pharmacists in South Africa},
Journal = {SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Since the outbreak of COVID-19, and its declaration as a pandemic by the
   World Health Organization (WHO), the reliance on pharmacists as one of
   the first points of contact within the healthcare system has been
   highlighted. This evidence-based review is aimed at providing guidance
   for pharmacists in community, hospital and other settings in South
   Africa, on the management of patients with suspected or confirmed
   coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. The situation is rapidly
   evolving, and new evidence continues to emerge on a daily basis. This
   guidance document takes into account and includes newly available
   evidence and recommendations, particularly around the following aspects
   relating to COVID-19:
   Epidemiology
   The virus, its modes of transmission and incubation period
   Symptom identification, including the differentiation between influenza,
   allergic rhinitis, sinusitis and COVID-19
   Social media myths and misinformation
   Treatment guidelines and medicines that may need to be kept in stock
   Treatment and prevention options, including an update on vaccine
   development
   The case for and against the use of NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors and
   angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19
   Interventions and patient counselling by the pharmacist.
   It is critical, though, that pharmacists access the most recent and
   authoritative information to guide their practice. Key websites that can
   be relied upon are:

Title = {Awareness, Perceptions, and Attitude Regarding Coronavirus Disease 2019
   (COVID-19) Among Ophthalmologists in Jordan: Cross-Sectional Online
   Survey},
Journal = {CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {2195-2202},
Abstract = {Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic is a serious public health concern, and the
   role of health care workers is essential in preventing spread. The study
   objective is to investigate awareness, perception, and attitude towards
   COVID-19 and infection control measures among ophthalmologists in
   Jordan.
   Methods: The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey among
   Jordanian ophthalmologists. An online survey was sent to 197
   ophthalmologists on March 23, 2020. Information on participants'
   socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of clinical features of
   COVID-19, risk assessment and infection control measures for preventing
   disease transmission, and attitude towards treating patients with
   COVID-19 were collected.
   Results: A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years)
   responded, 23 (17.6\%) had received training on infection control in
   ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and
   ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly
   reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing
   COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the
   commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75\%), and 38.2\% were not
   provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce
   transmission of COVID-19. Most ophthalmologists (79.5\%) thought that
   the virus could be detected in tears, and 72.2\% thought that red eye as
   a symptom of COVID-19.
   Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in Jordan were aware of the epidemiology of
   COVID-19 and related infection preventive measures. Knowledge was
   lacking regarding ocular aspects of the disease. Training on infection
   prevention needs to be improved. Access to guidelines from international
   ophthalmological organizations should be promoted and seeking updated
   literature from peer-reviewed journals needs to be encouraged.},

Abstract = {The recent increase in cancer epidemiology in Saudi Arabia might be due
   to the lack of health education and cancer awareness towards cancer
   prevention measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess
   demographic characteristics in attitude towards cancer prevention some
   measures in the Hail region, Saudi Arabia. This is a descriptive
   cross-sectional study conducted in Hail Region, Northern Saudi Arabia,
   during the period from June 2020 to December 2020. Out of focus on
   population, 420 individuals have responded. The respondents were
   included in the study regardless of their age, sex, or other
   demographical characteristics. For the question ``Cancer is a malignant
   tissue swelling only, not any lesion,{''} 397(94.5\%) responded,
   ``Yes.{''} For the question ``Any tissue lesion in the body is
   cancer,{''} 32(7.6\%) answered ``Yes,{''} included 23/323(7.1\%) were
   males, and 9/97(9.3\%) were females. Most participants got their
   information about cancer from ``social media{''} followed by ``When a
   relative diagnosed with cancer{''} and Awareness campaign, representing
   166/420(39.5\%), 142/420(33.8\%), and 58/420(13.8\%), respectively. For
   the question ``Some food can prevent cancer, and others increase the
   risk,{''} 201(47.9\%) responded ``Yes,{''} including 151/323(46.7\%)
   males and 50/97(51.5\%) females. About 125(30\%) of the participants
   believe that tobacco smoking cannot cause cancer, including
   90/323(27.9\%) males and 35/97(36\%) females. Conclusion: The Northern
   Saudi population's demographical characteristics have a strong influence
   on an individual's attitude towards cancer prevention and control
   measures. Increased age and education level have a positive impact on a
   better attitude towards cancer prevention measures.},

Title = {Web-Based Health Information-Seeking Methods and Time Since Provider
   Engagement: Cross-sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: The use of web-based methods to seek health information is
   increasing in popularity. As web-based health information (WHI)-seeking
   affects health-related decision support and chronic symptom
   self-management, WHI-seeking from online sources may impact health care
   decisions and outcomes, including care-seeking decisions. Patients who
   are routinely connected to physicians are more likely to receive better
   and more consistent care. Little is known about whether WHI-seeking
   impacts the frequency at which patients engage with health care
   providers.
   Objective: Our primary objective was to describe the associations
   between the use of web-based methods to seek information about one's own
   health and the time since last engaging with a health care provider
   about one's own health. Additionally, we aimed to assess participants'
   trust in health care organizations to contextualize our findings.
   Methods: We analyzed data from US adults participating in the nationally
   representative Tufts Equity in Health, Wealth, and Civic Engagement
   Survey (N=1034). Bivariate associations between demographic
   characteristics and health information-seeking methods were assessed
   with Pearson chi-squared tests. Bivariate associations of Medical
   Mistrust Index (MMI) scores with each health information-seeking method
   and time since provider engagement were assessed with F tests and
   adjusted Wald tests. We fit a multivariable logistic regression model to
   assess the association between WHI-seeking within the 12 months prior to
   survey (alone or in combination with provider-based methods versus
   provider only) and engagement with a provider more than 1 year prior to
   the time of survey, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex,
   education, insurance coverage, and MMI.
   Results: Age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health
   insurance source, MMI, and time since provider engagement were each
   significantly associated with the health information-seeking method in
   bivariate analyses. Compared to using only provider-based health
   information seeking methods, WHI-based methods alone or in combination
   with provider-based methods were associated with a 51\% lower likelihood
   (odds ratio 0.49, 95\% CI 0.27-0.87) of engaging with a provider within
   the previous year. Participants who used WHI-seeking methods alone and
   those who had not engaged with a health care provider within the
   previous year demonstrated a higher mean MMI score; however, MMI was not
   a significant predictor of time since engagement with a provider in the
   multivariable analysis.
   Conclusions: Our findings from a nationally representative survey
   suggest that for those who use WHI-seeking methods (alone or in
   combination with provider-based information-seeking methods), there is a
   statistically significant lower likelihood of engaging with a provider
   in a year compared to those who only use provider-based methods. Future
   research should consider the intent of a person's visit with a provider,
   trust in health care systems, methods of provider engagement, and
   specific web-based platforms for health information.},

Abstract = {Introduction The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant
   global mortality and impacted lives around the world. Virus Watch aims
   to provide evidence on which public health approaches are most likely to
   be effective in reducing transmission and impact of the virus, and will
   investigate community incidence, symptom profiles and transmission of
   COVID-19 in relation to population movement and behaviours. Methods and
   analysis Virus Watch is a household community cohort study of acute
   respiratory infections in England and Wales and will run from June 2020
   to August 2021. The study aims to recruit 50 000 people, including 12
   500 from minority ethnic backgrounds, for an online survey cohort and
   monthly antibody testing using home fingerprick test kits. Nested within
   this larger study will be a subcohort of 10 000 individuals, including
   3000 people from minority ethnic backgrounds. This cohort of 10 000
   people will have full blood serology taken between October 2020 and
   January 2021 and repeat serology between May 2021 and August 2021.
   Participants will also post self-administered nasal swabs for PCR assays
   of SARS-CoV-2 and will follow one of three different PCR testing
   schedules based on symptoms. Ethics and dissemination This study has
   been approved by the Hampstead National Health Service (NHS) Health
   Research Authority Ethics Committee (ethics approval number
   20/HRA/2320). We are monitoring participant queries and using these to
   refine methodology where necessary, and are providing summaries and
   policy briefings of our preliminary findings to inform public health
   action by working through our partnerships with our study advisory
   group, Public Health England, NHS and government scientific advisory
   panels.},

Title = {COVID-19: guidelines for pharmacists in South Africa},
Journal = {SA PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {87},
Number = {3},
Pages = {13-21},
Abstract = {Since the outbreak of COVID-19, and its declaration as a pandemic by the
   World Health Organization (WHO), the reliance on pharmacists as one of
   the first points of contact within the healthcare system has been
   highlighted. This evidence-based review is aimed at providing guidance
   for pharmacists in community, hospital and other settings in South
   Africa, on the management of patients with suspected or confirmed
   coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. The situation is rapidly
   evolving, and new evidence continues to emerge on a daily basis. This
   guidance document takes into account and includes newly available
   evidence and recommendations, particularly around the following aspects
   relating to COVID-19:
   Epidemiology
   The virus, its modes of transmission and incubation period
   Symptom identification, including the differentiation between influenza,
   allergic rhinitis, sinusitis and COVID-19
   Social media myths and misinformation
   Treatment guidelines and medicines that may need to be kept in stock
   Treatment and prevention options, including an update on vaccine
   development
   The case for and against the use of NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors and
   angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19
   Interventions and patient counselling by the pharmacist.
   It is critical, though, that pharmacists access the most recent and
   authoritative information to guide their practice. Key websites that can
   be relied upon are:

Title = {Distinct clinical phenotypes for Crohn's disease derived from patient
   surveys},
Journal = {BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Background Defining clinical phenotypes provides opportunities for new
   diagnostics and may provide insights into early intervention and disease
   prevention. There is increasing evidence that patient-derived health
   data may contain information that complements traditional methods of
   clinical phenotyping. The utility of these data for defining meaningful
   phenotypic groups is of great interest because social media and online
   resources make it possible to query large cohorts of patients with
   health conditions. Methods We evaluated the degree to which
   patient-reported categorical data is useful for discovering subclinical
   phenotypes and evaluated its utility for discovering new measures of
   disease severity, treatment response and genetic architecture.
   Specifically, we examined the responses of 1961 patients with
   inflammatory bowel disease to questionnaires in search of
   sub-phenotypes. We applied machine learning methods to identify novel
   subtypes of Crohn's disease and studied their associations with drug
   responses. Results Using the patients' self-reported information, we
   identified two subpopulations of Crohn's disease; these subpopulations
   differ in disease severity, associations with smoking, and genetic
   transmission patterns. We also identified distinct features of drug
   response for the two Crohn's disease subtypes. These subtypes show a
   trend towards differential genotype signatures. Conclusion Our findings
   suggest that patient-defined data can have unplanned utility for
   defining disease subtypes and may be useful for guiding treatment
   approaches.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {SLOfit Lifelong is a public health initiative which was created to
   upgrade a well-established, national physical fitness surveillance
   system for Slovenian schoolchildren that has been collecting annual
   fitness and health data for over three decades. The ultimate objective
   of creating SLOfit Lifelong was to build a modern societal
   infrastructure with the capacity and ability to detect future causal
   associations between childhood physical fitness trends and future health
   outcomes based on the lifelong surveillance of one's own fitness status.
   By instilling citizens with an ambition to test, understand, and
   follow-up their own physical fitness and health status (including
   related health risk factors), this initiative provides the technical
   support and expert feedback needed to engender greater individual
   control over understanding (and thus modulating), one's own physical
   fitness status as they progress into older adulthood. This perspective
   paper details the extensive approach taken to devise appropriate fitness
   test batteries for adults and older adults which can also relate to the
   student version of the original SLOfit test database, including
   establishing criterion health risk zones and a public approach to
   establish this national, citizen-driven health feedback framework.
   Through its sophisticated online web applications, social media, print
   media, and outreach workshops, SLOfit Lifelong provides the expert
   support for public health engagement by fostering positive lifelong
   physical literacy experiences an individual can enjoy across their aging
   journey.},

Abstract = {Epidemic preparedness depends on our ability to predict the trajectory
   of an epidemic and the human behavior that drives spread in the event of
   an outbreak. Changes to behavior during an outbreak limit the
   reliability of syndromic surveillance using large-scale data sources,
   such as online social media or search behavior, which could otherwise
   supplement healthcarebased outbreak-prediction methods. Here, we measure
   behavior change reflected in mobile-phone call-detail records (CDRs), a
   source of passively collected real-time behavioral information, using an
   anonymously linked dataset of cell-phone users and their date of
   influenza-like illness diagnosis during the 2009 H1N1v pandemic. We
   demonstrate that mobile-phone use during illness differs measurably from
   routine behavior: Diagnosed individuals exhibit less movement than
   normal (1.1 to 1.4 fewer unique tower locations; P < 3.2 x 10(-3)), on
   average, in the 2 to 4 d around diagnosis and place fewer calls (2.3 to
   3.3 fewer calls; P < 5.6 x 10(-4)) while spending longer on the phone
   (41- to 66-s average increase; P < 4.6 x 10(-10)) than usual on the day
   following diagnosis. The results suggest that anonymously linked CDRs
   and health data may be sufficiently granular to augment epidemic
   surveillance efforts and that infectious disease-modeling efforts
   lacking explicit behavior-change mechanisms need to be revisited.},

Title = {Mapping population vulnerability and community support during COVID-19:
   a case study from Wales},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background
   Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose an overwhelming demand on
   resources that cannot always be met by official organisations. Limited
   resources and human response to crises can lead members of local
   communities to turn to one another to fulfil immediate needs. This
   spontaneous citizen-led response can be crucial to a community's ability
   to cope in a crisis. It is thus essential to understand the scope of
   such initiatives so that support can be provided where it is most
   needed. Nevertheless, quickly developing situations and varying
   definitions can make the community response challenging to measure.
   Aim
   To create an accessible interactive map of the citizen-led community
   response to need during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, UK that combines
   information gathered from multiple data providers to reflect different
   interpretations of need and support.
   Approach
   We gathered data from a combination of official data providers and
   community-generated sources to create 14 variables representative of
   need and support. These variables are derived by a reproducible data
   pipeline that enables flexible integration of new data. The interactive
   tool is available online (www.covidresponsemap.wales) and can map
   available data at two geographic resolutions. Users choose their
   variables of interest, and interpretation of the map is aided by a
   linked bee-swarm plot.
   Discussion
   The novel approach we developed enables people at all levels of
   community response to explore and analyse the distribution of need and
   support across Wales. While there can be limitations to the accuracy of
   community-generated data, we demonstrate that they can be effectively
   used alongside traditional data sources to maximise the understanding of
   community action. This adds to our overall aim to measure community
   response and resilience, as well as to make complex population health
   data accessible to a range of audiences. Future developments include the
   integration of other factors such as well-being.},

Title = {Forecasting National-Level Self-Harm Trends With Social Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {64796-64814},
Abstract = {Self-harm pertains to actions of self-inflicted poisoning or injury that
   lead to either non-fatal injuries or death, irrespective of the
   individual's intention. Self-harm incidents not only cause loss to
   individuals but also incur a negative impact on the nation's economy.
   Studies have demonstrated an increase in trends of self-harm that are
   correlated with the emergence of technological advancements and swift
   urban expansion in developing countries. The capacity to nowcast and
   forecast national-level patterns of self-harm trends could be imperative
   to policymakers and stakeholders in the public health sector, as it
   would enable them to implement prompt measures to counteract the
   underlying factors or avert these projected calamities. Prior research
   has utilized historical data to predict self-harm trends at the
   population level in various nations using conventional statistical
   forecasting methods. However, in some countries, such historical
   statistics may be challenging to obtain or insufficient for accurate
   prediction, impeding the ability to comprehend and project the national
   self-harm landscape in a timely manner. This paper proposes FAST, a
   framework designed to forecast self-harm patterns at the national level
   by analyzing mental signals obtained from a large volume of social media
   data. These signals serve as a proxy for real-world population mental
   health that could be used to enhance the forecastability of self-harm
   trends. Specifically, language-agnostic language models are first
   trained to extract different mental signals from collected social media
   messages. Then, these signals are aggregated and processed into
   multi-variate time series, on which the time-delay embedding algorithm
   is applied to transform into temporal embedded instances. Finally,
   various machine learning regressors are validated for their
   forecastability. The proposed method is validated through a case study
   in Thailand, which utilizes a set of 12 mental signals extracted from
   tweets to forecast death and injury cases resulting from self-harm. The
   results show that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ARIMA
   baseline by 43.56\% and 36.48\% on average in terms of MAPE on
   forecasting death and injury cases from self-harm, respectively. As far
   as current understanding permits, our research represents the initial
   exploration of utilizing aggregated social media information for the
   purposes of nowcasting and forecasting trends of self-harm on a
   nationwide scale. The results not only provide insight into improved
   forecasting techniques for self-harm trends but also establish a
   foundation for forthcoming social-network-driven applications that hinge
   on the capacity to predict socioeconomic factors.},

Title = {Patterns of Suicide Ideation Across Eight Countries in Four Continents
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic Era: Repeated Cross-sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and countries' response measures have
   had a globally significant mental health impact. This mental health
   burden has also been fueled by an infodemic: an information overload
   that includes misinformation and disinformation. Suicide, the worst
   mental health outcome, is a serious public health problem that can be
   prevented with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions.
   Suicide ideation, one important risk factor for suicide, is thus
   important to measure and monitor, as are the factors that may impact on
   it.
   Objective: This investigation had 2 primary aims: (1) to estimate and
   compare country-specific prevalence of suicide ideation at 2 different
   time points, overall and by gender and age groups, and (2) to
   investigate the influence of sociodemographic and infodemic variables on
   suicide ideation.
   Methods: A repeated, online, 8-country (Canada, the United States,
   England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, and New Zealand),
   cross-sectional study was undertaken with adults aged 18 years, with
   measurement wave 1 conducted from May 29, 2020 to June 12, 2020 and
   measurement wave 2 conducted November 6-18, 2021. Self-reported suicide
   ideation was derived from item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9
   (PHQ-9). Age-standardized suicide ideation rates were reported, a
   binomial regression model was used to estimate suicide ideation
   indication rates for each country and measurement wave, and logistic
   regression models were then employed to relate sociodemographic,
   pandemic, and infodemic variables to suicide ideation.
   Results: The final sample totaled 17,833 adults: 8806 (49.4\%) from
   measurement wave 1 and 9027 (50.6\%) from wave 2. Overall, 24.2\%
   (2131/8806) and 27.5\% (2486/9027) of participants reported suicide
   ideation at measurement waves 1 and 2, respectively, a difference that
   was significant (P<.001). Considerable variability was observed in
   suicide ideation age-standardized rates between countries, ranging from
   15.6\% in Belgium (wave 1) to 42.9\% in Hong Kong (wave 2). Frequent
   social media usage was associated with increased suicide ideation at
   wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] 1.47, 95\% CI 1.25-1.72; P<.001) but
   not wave 1 (AOR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.96-1.23; P=.16). However, having a
   weaker sense of coherence (SOC; AOR 3.80, 95\% CI 3.18-4.55 at wave 1
   and AOR 4.39, 95\% CI 3.66-5.27 at wave 2; both P<.001) had the largest
   overall effect size.
   Conclusions: Suicide ideation is prevalent and significantly increasing
   over time in this COVID-19 pandemic era, with considerable variability
   between countries. Younger adults and those residing in Hong Kong
   carried disproportionately higher rates. Social media appears to have an
   increasingly detrimental association with suicide ideation, although
   having a stronger SOC had a larger protective effect. Policies and
   promotion of SOC, together with disseminating health information that
   explicitly tackles the infodemic's misinformation and disinformation,
   may importantly reduce the rising mental health morbidity and mortality
   triggered by this pandemic.},

Year = {2018},
Pages = {545-564},
Abstract = {Sedentary behaviour is influenced by factors across all levels of the
   social ecological model. This chapter focuses on the physical and social
   environmental level of analysis. The chapter summarizes environmental
   correlates of sedentary behaviour, addresses potential theoretical
   approaches, and examines the evidence for the effectiveness of
   environmental interventions on sedentary behaviour. Where relevant, the
   discussion is separated into young people, adults, and older adults.
   Some features of the home and workplace have been shown to be associated
   with sedentary behaviour; however, less is known about influences on
   sedentary behaviour in other contexts. Theoretical perspectives that may
   be particularly relevant when considering environmental influences are
   discussed, including social cognitive theory, habit theory, social
   network analysis, and systems theory. The theories employed need to try
   and capture the complex interrelationships between individuals, the
   groups they operate within and the physical and social context. There is
   evidence to suggest that incorporating environmental modifications into
   sedentary behaviour interventions is likely to be effective for both
   young people and adults.},

Title = {Digital Information Technology Use, Self-Rated Health, and Depression:
   Population-Based Analysis of a Survey Study on Older Migrants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Background: Previous studies have found that in general, poor health is
   associated with a lower likelihood of internet use in older adults, but
   it is not well known how different indicators of health are associated
   with different types of digital information technology (DIT) use.
   Moreover, little is known about the relationship between health and the
   types of DIT use in older ethnic minority and migrant populations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the associations among
   depressive symptoms and self-rated health (SRH) with different
   dimensions of DIT use in older migrants.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Care, Health and Ageing of
   Russian-speaking Minority (CHARM) study, which is based on a nationally
   representative sample of community-dwelling, Russian-speaking adults
   aged 50 years or older residing permanently in Finland (men: 616/1082,
   56.93\%; age: mean 63.2 years, SD 8.4 years; response rate: 1082/3000,
   36.07\%). Data were collected in 2019 using a postal survey. Health was
   measured using depressive symptoms (measured using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and SRH. Binary logistic
   regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between
   the two health indicators and the following six outcomes: daily internet
   use, smartphone ownership, the use of the internet for messages and
   calls, social media use, the use of the internet for personal health
   data, and obtaining health information from the internet. A number of
   sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the
   logistic regression regression analysis. Analyses were performed with
   weights accounting for the survey design and nonresponse.
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors,
   depressive symptoms (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.68, 95\% CI 1.37-5.24; P=.004)
   and poor SRH (OR 7.90, 95\% CI 1.88-33.11; P=.005) were associated with
   a higher likelihood of not using the internet daily. Depressive symptoms
   (OR 1.88, 95\% CI 1.06-3.35; P=.03) and poor SRH (OR 5.05, 95\% CI
   1.58-16.19; P=.006) also increased the likelihood of smartphone nonuse.
   Depressive symptoms were additionally associated with a lower likelihood
   of social media use, and poor SRH was associated with a lower likelihood
   of using the internet for messaging and calling.
   Conclusions: Poor SRH and depressive symptoms are associated with a
   lower likelihood of DIT use in older adults. Longitudinal studies are
   required to determine the directions of these relationships.},

Title = {Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak
   based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study},
Journal = {LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {E201-E208},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational
   awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to
   compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from
   news media and social networks.
   Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched
   DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently
   streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese
   health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19
   and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in
   China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of
   COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times,
   and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed
   trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak
   progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset,
   seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after
   Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made
   publicly available in real time.
   Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported
   between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and
   143 from outside of China. 281 (55\%) patients were male and the median
   age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 {[}3\%]) were younger
   than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for
   baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children.
   Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking
   care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other
   provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China,
   these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days
   thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0.0009). Although our sample captures
   only 507 (5.2\%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official
   sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official
   report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
   Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the
   progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in
   the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central
   physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of
   publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses,
   social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing
   fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and
   overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak,
   availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical
   efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide
   interventions. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Natural disasters can have significant consequences for population
   mental health. Using a digital spatial epidemiologic approach, this
   study documents emotional changes over space and time in the context of
   a large-scale disaster. Our aims were to (a) explore the spatial
   distribution of negative emotional expressions of Twitter users before,
   during, and after Superstorm Sandy in New York City (NYC) in 2012 and
   (b) examine potential correlations between socioeconomic status and
   infrastructural damage with negative emotional expressions across NYC
   census tracts over time. A total of 984,311 geo-referenced tweets with
   negative basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame) were
   collected and assigned to the census tracts within NYC boroughs between
   8 October and 18 November 2012. Global and local univariate and
   bivariate Moran's I statistics were used to analyze the data. We found
   local spatial clusters of all negative emotions over all disaster
   periods. Socioeconomic status and infrastructural damage were
   predominantly correlated with disgust, fear, and shame post-disaster. We
   identified spatial clusters of emotional reactions during and in the
   aftermath of a large-scale disaster that could help provide guidance
   about where immediate and long-term relief measures are needed the most,
   if transferred to similar events and on comparable data worldwide.},

Title = {Fiction, Falsehoods, and Few Facts: Cross-Sectional Study on the
   Content-Related Quality of Atopic Eczema-Related Videos on YouTube},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: In recent years, YouTube has become a recognized source of
   medical information for health care consumers. Although YouTube has
   advantages in this context, there are potential dangers as videos may
   contain nonscientific, misleading, or even harmful information.
   Objective: As little is known about YouTube as a source of information
   on atopic dermatitis (AD), we investigated the content-related quality
   of AD videos and their perception among YouTube users.
   Methods: The quality of the 100 most viewed AD videos was assessed by
   using the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and the DISCERN instrument. Videos
   were classified as ``useful,{''} ``misleading,{''} and ``potentially
   harmful,{''} and the correlations of viewers' ratings (likes) with the
   GQS and DISCERN scores were assessed.
   Results: Among the 100 videos, 68.0\% (68/100) and 62.0\% (62/100) were
   of poor and very poor scientific quality, respectively. Additionally,
   32.0\% (32/100) of the videos were classified as useful, 48.0\% (48/100)
   were classified as misleading, and 34.0\% (34/100) were classified as
   potentially harmful. Viewers' ratings did not correlate with the GQS and
   DISCERN scores. Overall, 50.0\% (50/100) of the videos were posted by
   private individuals and promoters of complementary/alternative
   treatments, 42.0\% (42/100) by therapeutical advertisers, and only 8.0\%
   (8/100) by nonprofit organizations/universities.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that two-thirds of the videos
   analyzed were below acceptable medical quality standards and that many
   videos were disseminating misleading or even dangerous content.
   Subjective and anecdotal content was over-represented, and viewers did
   not appear to be able to distinguish between high- and low-quality
   videos. Health promotion strategies by professional medical
   organizations are needed to improve their presence and visibility on
   YouTube.},

Title = {The awareness of neglected tropical diseases in a sample of medical and

Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of chronic diseases
   affecting 1.2 billion people worldwide, with more burden in the
   developing communities. Improving awareness about NTDs is a powerful
   affordable long-term intervention for infection control. In literature,
   there is a limited number of studies in the developing countries
   assessing the awareness of healthcare providers regarding these
   diseases. The present study aimed at assessing the awareness of a sample
   of Cairo University medical and nursing students regarding NTDs. A
   cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 184 medical and
   nursing students in Cairo University. An anonymous self-administered
   questionnaire in English language with an estimated completion time of
   15 minutes was used for evaluation. It included question categories
   which cover the knowledge about NTDs and control measures as well as the
   willingness to participate in NTDs control activities. Content analysis
   was performed on the materials and specifications of the epidemiology
   course given to medical and nursing students. Out of the study
   participants, 26\% knew the meaning of NTDs. The main source of their
   knowledge was social media followed by the epidemiology course. A
   percentage of 33\% of the students agreed that NTDs are of public health
   importance in Egypt. Thirty four percent of the participants expressed
   their willingness to participate in control activities for NTDs.
   Comparing medical and nursing students, a higher percentage of the
   nursing students stated that NTDs are causing a public health problem in
   Egypt with a statistically significant difference (P value < 0.001),
   while a statistically significant higher percentage of medical students
   believed that the awareness level regarding NTDs in Egypt is low (P
   value = 0.002). Cairo University medical and nursing students in this
   study showed a gap in the level of knowledge regarding NTDs and their
   control activities which represents a great threat to the control of
   these diseases.
   Author summary
   Egypt vision 2030 aiming that all Egyptians should have healthy, safe,
   and secure life. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Egypt has
   the highest rate of NTDs. Current medical and nursing students are the
   future healthcare workers who will be responsible to participate in
   control activities for the elimination of these diseases in Egypt. The
   present study aimed to provide information about the awareness of
   medical and nursing students regarding NTDs and their control
   activities. We targeted medical and nursing students who have finished
   an epidemiology course. Our results showed that only one fourth of the
   students knew the meaning of NTDs and nearly half of them agreed that
   the awareness of NTDs is poor among Egyptians. Although only 5\% of the
   included students are aware of NTDs control activities, about one third
   of them agreed to participate in these activities. Nowadays, there is an
   urgent need to update the curricula of medical students in Egypt,
   especially because of the new program the medical schools in Egypt are
   experiencing currently (five years of studying and two years for
   training). Also, the engagement of medical and nursing students in
   research and prevention activities to combat NTDs should be encouraged
   in the training years.},

Title = {Treatment options in idiopathic subglottic stenosis: protocol for a
   prospective international multicentre pragmatic trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is an unexplained
   progressive obstruction of the upper airway that occurs almost
   exclusively in adult, Caucasian women. The disease is characterised by
   mucosal inflammation and localised fibrosis resulting in
   life-threatening blockage of the upper airway. Because of high
   recurrence rates, patients with iSGS will frequently require multiple
   procedures following their initial diagnosis. Both the disease and its
   therapies profoundly affect patients' ability to breathe, communicate
   and swallow. A variety of treatments have been advanced to manage this
   condition. However, comparative data on effectiveness and side effects
   of the unique approaches have never been systematically evaluated. This
   study will create an international, multi-institutional prospective
   cohort of patients with iSGS. It will compare three surgical approaches
   to determine how well the most commonly used treatments in iSGS `work'
   and what quality of life (QOL) trade-offs are associated with each
   approach.
   Methods and analysis A prospective pragmatic trial comparing the
   `Standard of Care' for iSGS at multiple international institutions.
   Patients with a diagnosis of iSGS without clinical or laboratory
   evidence of vasculitis or a history of endotracheal intubation 2 years
   prior to symptom onset will be included in the study. Prospective
   evaluation of disease recurrence requiring operative intervention,
   validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as well as
   patient-generated health data (mobile peak flow recordings and daily
   steps taken) will be longitudinally tracked for 36 months. The primary
   endpoint is treatment effectiveness defined as time to recurrent
   operative procedure. Secondary endpoints relate to treatment side
   effects and include PRO measures in voice, swallowing, breathing and
   global QOL as well as patient-generated health data.
   Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the local IRB
   Committee of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in July 2015. The
   findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed
   journals, national and international conference presentations and
   directly to patient with iSGS via social media-based support groups.},

Abstract = {Aim We aimed to evaluate the quality of information available on YouTube
   regarding the basic information, examination, diagnosis, and the
   treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
   Methods A YouTube search was performed on https://www.youtube.com/for
   videos pertaining to ``retinopathy of prematurity{''} and ``ROP.{''} The
   first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. Two
   ophthalmologist reviewers independently evaluated and classified the
   videos as useful or misleading. The videos were accepted as
   ``useful,{''} if they provide scientifically correct information about
   any aspect of ROP: cause, pathogenesis, symptoms, findings, treatments,
   procedure details of the treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis. The
   videos contain scientifically unproven information are defined as
   ``misleading.{''} Videos were also classified according to the source:
   surgeon/practitioner, independent user, hospital/free clinic, social
   media/TV, medical site, university, and advertisement.
   Results The mean duration, the mean days on YouTube, the mean comments
   per videos, and the mean dislikes per video were similar in useful and
   misleading videos. However, the mean likes per day, mean view per video,
   and mean view per day were significantly higher in useful videos than
   those of misleading videos (p = 0.004, p = 0.022, and p = 0.011,
   respectively). Most of the useful videos were uploaded by healthcare
   professionals including source from university, hospital/free clinic,
   and surgeon/practitioner (48/64). The videos uploaded by healthcare
   professionals were more useful compared to those of non-healthcare
   professionals (p = 0.029).
   Conclusion YouTube could be used as an important tool for patient
   information in ROP. However, one third of the YouTube videos regarding
   ROP are misleading and may present a risk of harmful consequences. In
   this aspect, authoritative videos by healthcare professionals should be
   uploaded for dissemination of reliable information on ROP.},

Abstract = {Background: Coronavirusdiseasese 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected
   the world deeply. Successfully control and minimization of related
   morbidity and mortality require changing the behavior, which is
   influenced by knowledge and perceptions. This study aimed to explore the
   level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of medical students (MS)
   regarding COVID-19 and to identify their associated factors. Methods: A
   cross-sectional study involving 431 ungraduated MS was conducted in Sfax
   Medical School, Southern Tunisia, in November 2020. Results: The global
   scores of COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice among MS were 74.6
   +/- 13, 69 +/- 10.2, and 78.8 +/- 13.6/100, respectively. Prevalence of
   good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice was 47.1\%, 19.3\%,
   and 61.3\%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the independent
   factors of good knowledge were current smoking (adjusted odds ratio
   {[}AOR]=1.8; p=0.04), assistance to training sessions (AOR=1.5; p=0.04)
   and specialized residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.02). History of
   chronic disease was an independant predictor of positive attitude
   (AOR=2.4; p=0.009), while current smoking (AOR=0.4; p=0.01)
   wasindependantly associated with negative attitude. Social media used as
   a main source of information about COVID-19 was independently associated
   with poor knowledge (AOR=0.5; p=0.01) and negative attitude (AOR=0.4;
   p=0.008). Independant factors of good practice were specialized
   residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.01), being in close contact
   exposure with COVID-19 cases (AOR= 2.1; p=0.04) and having good
   knowledge (AOR=2.2; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Tunisian MS had satisfactory
   knowledge and practice about COVID-19, butthey had lower positive
   attitude rates towards this emergent disease. Thus, development of
   interactive courses on emerging diseases and travel epidemiology are
   higly recommended.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives To investigate attitudes towards family involvement
   in care among a broad sample of Danish nurses from all sectors and
   healthcare settings.
   Background Evidence suggests that nurses hold both supportive and less
   supportive attitudes about involvement of family members in the care of
   patients, and the existing findings are limited to specific healthcare
   contexts.
   Design A cross-sectional study adhering to the Strengthening the
   Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for reporting
   observational studies.
   Methods Using snowball sampling, the Families' Importance in Nursing
   Care-Nurses' Attitudes questionnaire was initially administered to a
   broad, convenience sample of Danish registered nurses through social
   media: Facebook interest groups and the homepage of the Danish Family
   Nursing Association. These nurses were encouraged to send the invitation
   to participate in their network of nursing colleagues. Complete data
   sets from 1,720 nurses were available for analysis.
   Results In general, the nurses considered the family as important in
   patient care. Nurses who held master's and doctorate degrees scored
   significantly higher than nurses with a basic nursing education. Nurses
   who had had experience with illness within their own families tended to
   score higher on the family as a conversational partner subscale than
   those without this experience. Nurses with the longest engagement within
   hospital settings scored significantly lower than those with the longest
   engagement within primary health care and/or psychiatry.
   Conclusions Families are considered important in nursing care. Younger
   nurses with a basic education, short-term engagement at a hospital and
   no experiences with illness within their own families were predictors of
   less supportive attitudes towards including the family in nursing care.
   Relevance to clinical practice Clinical leaders and managers should
   promote education on the importance of active family involvement in
   patient care in clinical practice and undergraduate education. More
   focus on collaboration with families in the hospital setting is needed.},

Title = {Improving social justice in observational studies: protocol for the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {BackgroundAddressing persistent and pervasive health inequities is a
   global moral imperative, which has been highlighted and magnified by the
   societal and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Observational
   studies can aid our understanding of the impact of health and structural
   oppression based on the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity, age and
   other factors, as they frequently collect this data. However, the
   Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
   (STROBE) guideline, does not provide guidance related to reporting of
   health equity. The goal of this project is to develop a STROBE-Equity
   reporting guideline extension.MethodsWe assembled a diverse team across
   multiple domains, including gender, age, ethnicity, Indigenous
   background, disciplines, geographies, lived experience of health
   inequity and decision-making organizations. Using an inclusive,
   integrated knowledge translation approach, we will implement a
   five-phase plan which will include: (1) assessing the reporting of
   health equity in published observational studies, (2) seeking wide
   international feedback on items to improve reporting of health equity,
   (3) establishing consensus amongst knowledge users and researchers, (4)
   evaluating in partnership with Indigenous contributors the relevance to
   Indigenous peoples who have globally experienced the oppressive legacy
   of colonization, and (5) widely disseminating and seeking endorsement
   from relevant knowledge users. We will seek input from external
   collaborators using social media, mailing lists and other communication
   channels.DiscussionAchieving global imperatives such as the Sustainable
   Development Goals (e.g., SDG 10 Reduced inequalities, SDG 3 Good health
   and wellbeing) requires advancing health equity in research. The
   implementation of the STROBE-Equity guidelines will enable a better
   awareness and understanding of health inequities through better
   reporting. We will broadly disseminate the reporting guideline with
   tools to enable adoption and use by journal editors, authors, and
   funding agencies, using diverse strategies tailored to specific
   audiences.},

Title = {Inflammatory bowel disease in sub-Saharan Africa: a protocol of a
   prospective registry with a nested case-control study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Introduction The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
   sub-Saharan Africa is poorly documented. We have started a registry to
   determine the burden, phenotype, risk factors, disease course and
   outcomes of IBD in Zimbabwe.
   Methods and analysis A prospective observational registry with a nested
   case-control study has been established at a tertiary hospital in
   Harare, Zimbabwe. The registry is recruiting confirmed IBD cases from
   the hospital, and other facilities throughout Zimbabwe. Demographic and
   clinical data are obtained at baseline, 6 months and annually. Two age
   and sex-matched non-IBD controls per case are recruited-a sibling or
   second-degree relative, and a randomly selected individual from the same
   neighbourhood. Cases and controls are interviewed for potential risk
   factors of IBD, and dietary intake using a food frequency questionnaire.
   Stool is collected for 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling, and along
   with germline DNA from peripheral blood, is being biobanked. The
   estimated sample size is 86 cases and 172 controls, and the overall
   registry is anticipated to run for at least 5 years. Descriptive
   statistics will be used to describe the demographic and phenotypic
   characteristics of IBD, and incidence and prevalence will be estimated
   for Harare. Risk factors for IBD will be analysed using conditional
   logistic regression. For microbial analysis, alpha diversity and beta
   diversity will be compared between cases and controls, and between IBD
   phenotypes. Mann-Whitney U tests for alpha diversity and Adonis
   (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) for beta diversity
   will be computed.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the
   Parirenyatwa Hospital's and University of Zimbabwe's research ethics
   committee and the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe. Findings will be
   discussed with patients, and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health. Results
   will be presented at scientific meetings, published in peer reviewed
   journals, and on social media.},

Title = {Run4Love, a mHealth (WeChat-based) intervention to improve mental health
   of people living with HIV: a randomized controlled trial protocol},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Background: People living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from high rates of
   mental illness; but targeted effective interventions are limited,
   especially in developing countries. High penetration of smartphone usage
   and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an
   unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth
   interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current
   report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love
   randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in
   PLWH in China.
   Methods: A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were
   recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group.
   Participants in the intervention group received an adapted
   cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the
   enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in
   physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically
   tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control
   group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard
   care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9
   months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms
   measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression
   (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress
   measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress
   and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical
   activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated
   measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects.
   Discussion: The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and
   evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve
   the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective,
   Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine
   case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic
   diseases.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies on Online/Digital/Internet-Mediated
   Alcohol Marketing: a Systematic Review},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe rapid growth of social networking sites and video sharing
   platforms has created an opportunity for the alcohol industry to employ
   advanced advertising and marketing approaches to target their audiences,
   increasingly blurring the lines between commercial marketing and
   user-generated content, which poses a challenge for effective
   regulation.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search through three
   peer-reviewed journal databases (WoS, PubMed, Scopus). Studies were
   included if published in English, after 2004, and assessed statutory
   regulation or voluntary industry codes, enacted by an EU or nation's
   governmental agency or private entity, and with the intent to restrict
   digital alcohol advertising. In addition, we conducted a manual search
   of gray literature.ResultsA total of 4690 records were identified. After
   duplicate removal and full-text assessment, 14 articles were examined.
   Our findings indicate that children and adolescents may often be exposed
   to alcohol advertisements on social media and websites due to industry's
   self-regulatory age-affirmation systems being largely ineffective at
   preventing under-aged access. Cases of self-regulatory violations by the
   alcohol industry, and increasingly innovative `gray-area' advertising
   approaches have also been noted. Additionally, research illustrates a
   lack of developed statutory restrictions of digital alcohol advertising
   and instead continued reliance on voluntary industry
   self-regulation.ConclusionsThere is a substantial need for further
   research to examine the effectiveness of digital alcohol advertising
   restrictions in social media, websites and image/video sharing
   platforms. Moreover, there is a necessity for countries to develop
   comprehensive statutory frameworks, which would effectively restrict and
   monitor rapidly advancing digital alcohol advertising practices on new
   digital media.},

Month = {2023 DEC},
Abstract = {Medical humanities has tended first and foremost to be associated with
   the ways in which the arts and humanities help us to understand health.
   However, this is not the only or necessarily the primary aim of our
   field. What the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed above all is what the
   field of critical medical humanities has insisted on: the deep
   entanglement of social, cultural, historical life with the biomedical.
   The pandemic has been a time for reinstating the power of expertise of a
   particular kind, focusing on epidemiology, scientific modelling of
   potential outcomes and vaccine development. All of this delivered by
   science at speed.It has been challenging for medical humanities
   researchers to find purchase in these debates with insights from our
   more contemplative, `slow research' approaches. However, as the height
   of the crisis passes, our field might now be coming into its own. The
   pandemic, as well as being productive of scientific expertise, also
   demonstrated clearly the meaning of culture: that it is not a static
   entity, but is produced and evolves through interaction and
   relationship. Taking a longer view, we can see the emergence of a
   certain `COVID-19 culture' characterised by entanglements between expert
   knowledge, social media, the economy, educational progress, risk to
   health services and people in their socio-economic, political ethnic and
   religious/spiritual contexts. It is the role of medical humanities to
   pay attention to those interactions and to examine how they play out in
   the human experience and potential impact of the pandemic. However, to
   survive and grow in significance within the field of healthcare
   research, we need to engage not just to comment. There is a need for
   medical humanities scholars to assert our expertise in interdisciplinary
   research, fully engaged with experts by experience, and to work
   proactively with funders to demonstrate our value.},

Journal = {ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 SEP},
Abstract = {Online media reports provide valuable information for road traffic
   injury prevention, but technical challenges concerning data acquisition
   and processing limit analysis and interpretation of such data.
   Integrating injury epidemiology theory and big data technology, we
   developed a data platform consisting of four layers (data acquisition,
   data processing, application and data storage) to automatically collect
   reports from online Chinese media concerning road traffic crashes every
   24 h. We built a text classification model using 20,000 manually
   annotated news stories based on the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers (BERT) and then used natural language
   processing algorithms to extract data concerning 27 structured variables
   from the news sources. The accuracy of the BERT-based text
   classification model was 0.9271, with information extraction accuracy
   exceeding 80\% for 22 variables. As of November 30, 2021, the data
   platform collected 244,650 eligible media reports covering all 333
   prefecture-level divisions in China. These reports were from 37,073
   websites or social media accounts, which were geographically located in
   all 31 provinces and over 98\% of prefecture-level divisions. Data
   availability varied greatly from 0.9\% to 100\% across the 27 structured
   variables. Additionally, the platform identified 645,787 potentially
   relevant keywords when applying natural language processing techniques
   to the textual media reports. Platform data were highly correlated with
   road police data in province-based road traffic crash statistics
   (crashes, r(s) = 0.799; non-fatal injuries, r(s) = 0.802; deaths, r(s) =
   0.775). In particular, the platform offers valuable data (like crashes
   involving electric vehicles) that are not included in official mad
   traffic crash statistics. The new automated data platform shows great
   potential for timely detection of emerging characteristics of mad
   traffic crashes. Further research is needed to improve the platform and
   apply it to real-time monitoring and analysis of road traffic injuries.},

Title = {Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Dry Eye Disease Among Children
   and Adults in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Background: Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by loss of
   homeostasis of the tear film or failure to produce sufficient amounts of
   tears to moisturize the eyes. The condition has been associated with
   several preventable risk factors.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to calculate the prevalence of
   dry eye and determine the associated risk factors among adults and
   children in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study targeting all Saudi
   populations, including all the regions of Saudi Arabia. The Ocular
   Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the five-item Dry Eye Questionnaire
   (DEQ-5) were used for data collection. Data were collected using an
   online form that was distributed through social media.
   Results: A total of 541 responses were analyzed. The OSDI scores showed
   that females represented 70.9\%, and the age group of 20-40 years
   represented 59.7\%. The prevalence of DED, including all severity
   levels, was 74.9\%. The distribution across levels was as follows: mild
   cases at 26.2\%, moderate cases at 18.2\%, and severe at 30.4\%. On the
   other hand, DEQ-5 has shown a prevalence of 37\% among the pediatric age
   group. Several risk factors have been significantly associated with
   adults' dry eye, including low humidity (Pvalue=0.002), reading,
   driving, or watching electronic screens for extended durations
   (P-value=0.019), autoimmune diseases (P-value=0.033), and undergoing eye
   procedures (P-value-0.013).
   Conclusion: The current study reports a high prevalence rate of dry eyes
   among the Saudi population. Reading, driving, and using electronic
   screens for an extended period were found to be associated with the
   severity of DED. Prospective studies should focus on the epidemiology of
   the disease, which will provide evidence for better preventive and
   therapeutic measures.},

Title = {Depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {2021 OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: The outbreak of coronavirus posits deleterious
   consequences on global healthcare system while affecting human life in
   every aspect. Despite several measures undertaken to limit the
   socio-economic effect of coronavirus, various challenges remain
   pervasive, and one such challenge is mental health, particularly
   depression and anxiety. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence
   and determinants of depression and anxiety in Malaysian population
   during third wave of COVID-19.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out via social
   media platforms and 1544 Malaysians were selected. The level of
   depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9) and
   scored accordingly for categorization. Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale
   (SAS) was used as a self-assessment survey to quantify the level of
   anxiety of persons experiencing anxiety-related symptoms. Percentage
   distribution and logistic regression analysis were used in the data
   analysis.
   Results: Results showed that one-fourth (25.1\%) of the participants had
   severe depressive symptoms. Almost one sixth (18.7\%) had mild
   depressive symptoms and one-third (34.1\%) had mild to moderate anxiety
   symptoms. Age, gender, and friends infected with virus were the three
   important predictors of depression and anxiety. The odds of having
   depression (OR = 1.44; C.I. = 1.32-1.62) and anxiety (OR = 1.36; C.I. =
   1.27-1.47) were significantly higher among females than in males.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of the study participants were
   facing mild to severe depression and anxiety symptoms which is very
   alarming as the pandemic is still now increasing across the country.
   Immediate interventions including community counselling programmes, TV
   and social media campaigns are urgently needed to reduce the
   psychological stress among the Malaysian population.},

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Determinants of Acceptance among
   Healthcare Workers, Academics and Tertiary Students in Nigeria},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of human deaths,
   prompting the rapid development and regulatory approval of several
   vaccines. Although Nigeria implemented a COVID-19 vaccination program on
   15 March 2021, low vaccine acceptance remains a major challenge. To
   provide insight on factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
   (VH), we conducted a national survey among healthcare workers,
   academics, and tertiary students, between 1 September 2021 and 31
   December 2021. We fitted a logistic regression model to the data and
   examined factors associated with VH to support targeted health awareness
   campaigns to address public concerns and improve vaccination rates on
   par with global efforts. A total of 1525 respondents took part in the
   survey, composed of healthcare-workers (24.5\%, 373/1525), academics
   (26.9\%, 410/1525), and students (48.7\%, 742/1525). Only 29\%
   (446/1525) of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of this study.
   Of the 446 vaccinated respondents, 35.7\% (159/446), 61.4\% (274/446)
   and 2.9\% (13/446) had one, two and three or more doses, respectively.
   Reasons for VH included: difficulty in the vaccination
   request/registration protocols (21.3\%, 633/1079); bad feelings towards
   the vaccines due to negative social media reports/rumours (21.3\%,
   633/1079); personal ideology/religious beliefs against vaccination
   (16.7\%, 495/1079); and poor confidence that preventive measures were
   enough to protect against COVID-19 (11\%, 323/1079). Some health
   concerns that deterred unvaccinated respondents were: innate immunity
   issues (27.7\%, 345/1079); allergic reaction concerns (24.6\%,
   307/1079); and blood clot problems in women (21.4\%, 266/1079). In the
   multivariable model, location of respondents/geopolitical zones, level
   of education, testing for COVID-19, occupation/job description and
   religion were significantly associated with VH. Findings from this study
   underscore the need for targeted awareness creation to increase COVID-19
   vaccination coverage in Nigeria and elsewhere. Besides professionals,
   similar studies are recommended in the general population to develop
   appropriate public health interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine
   uptake.},

Abstract = {Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major public health
   problem. Even in high-income countries, survival rates have plateaued in
   the range of ten percent, stimulating an ongoing interest in developing
   novel approaches to resuscitation. Emergency Medical Services
   (EMS)-witnessed OHCAs constitute a subgroup of overall OHCA that occur
   after the arrival of EMS, leading to rapid initiation of resuscitation
   and significantly improved survival. In this narrative review we
   summarize and interpret recent developments in knowledge of
   EMS-witnessed OHCA regarding prevalence, demographics, location,
   circumstances, survival outcomes and clinical profile. We examine the
   possibility of informing novel resuscitation approaches and enhancing
   mechanistic knowledge by studying EMS-witnessed OHCA, with the goal of
   improving overall survival from OHCA.},

Abstract = {This study explored the role of social activism in the association of
   exposure to media coverage of police brutality and protests with
   perceptions of mental health. Data for this study came from a sample of
   African Americans (N = 304) who responded to an online survey.
   Perceptions of mental health were assessed using a single item developed
   by the research team. Exposure to police brutality and protests was
   measured by asking how often they had seen or heard about African
   Americans being victims of police brutality and seen or heard about
   protests on television, social media, or other outlets. Participants
   were also asked about the extent to which these events caused them
   emotional distress. Social activism was assessed by asking participants
   if they had ever participated in political activities, such as calling
   their representative. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted
   using linear regression. Moderation analyses showed that greater
   emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and
   protests was associated with worse perceptions of mental health only
   when engagement in social activism was low. In contrast, mediation
   analyses indicated that greater frequency of and emotional distress from
   exposure to media coverage was indirectly associated with worse
   perceptions of mental health through increased engagement in social
   activism. Social activism may be an important method for coping with
   emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and
   protests, but more research is needed to understand how African
   Americans might engage in social activism without adversely impacting
   mental health.},

Title = {Which are the vital factors of mobile personal health records
   applications that promote continued usage? A perspective on technology
   fit and social capital},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {IntroductionWith the widespread use of mobile devices and the rapid
   development of mobile networks, connecting mobile personal health record
   (mPHR) apps to wearable devices to collect personal health data for
   analysis and community activities has become a trend for health
   promotion. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the vital
   factors that impact the sustained usage of mPHR apps. ObjectiveIn this
   study, we identified social lock-in as a major research gap in the
   current era of social media and the Internet. Therefore, to explore the
   effects of mPHR apps on continued app usage intention, we combined
   technology fit (individual-technology, synchronicity-technology, and
   task-technology fit) and social capital (structural, relational, and
   cognitive capital) to develop a novel study model. MethodsThe purpose of
   this research is to investigate the willingness to participate in the
   mPHR apps. It collected 565 valid users' responses through the online
   questionnaire with a structural equation modeling approach. ResultsThat
   technology and social lock-in significantly affected the willingness of
   users to continue using mPHR apps (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) and that the
   effects of social lock-in (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) were more pronounced
   than those of technology lock-in (beta = 0.22, P < 0.001).
   ConclusionsThe technology and social lock-in generated by technology fit
   and social capital had positive effects on continued app usage and the
   effects of both types of lock-in on continued app usage varied among
   different participant groups.},

Abstract = {The Food Chain Plus (FoCus) cohort was launched in 2011 for
   population-based research related to metabolic inflammation. To
   characterize this novel pathology in a comprehensive manner, data
   collection included multiple omics layers such as phenomics,
   microbiomics, metabolomics, genomics, and metagenomics as well as
   nutrition profiling, taste perception phenotyping and social network
   analysis. The cohort was set-up to represent a Northern German
   population of the Kiel region. Two-step recruitment included the
   randomised enrolment of participants via residents' registration offices
   and via the Obesity Outpatient Centre of the University Medical Center
   Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH). Hence, both a population- and metabolic
   inflammation- based cohort was created. In total, 1795 individuals were
   analysed at baseline. Baseline data collection took place between 2011
   and 2014, including 63\% females and 37\% males with an age range of
   18-83 years. The median age of all participants was 52.0 years {[}IQR:
   42.5; 63.0 years] and the median baseline BMI in the study population
   was 27.7 kg/m(2) {[}IQR: 23.7; 35.9 kg/m(2)]. In the baseline cohort,
   14.1\% of participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was more
   prevalent in the subjects of the metabolic inflammation group (MIG;
   31.8\%). Follow-up for the assessment of disease progression, as well as
   the onset of new diseases with changes in subject's phenotype, diet or
   lifestyle factors is planned every 5 years. The first follow-up period
   was finished in 2020 and included 820 subjects.},

Title = {Societal costs of multiple sclerosis in Ireland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {425-437},
Abstract = {Aims: This paper evaluates the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) in
   Ireland, and estimates the associated direct, indirect, and intangible
   costs to society based on a large nationally representative sample.
   Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed to capture the
   demographics, disease characteristics, healthcare use, informal care,
   employment, and wellbeing. Referencing international studies,
   standardized survey instruments were included (e.g. CSRI, MFIS-5, EQ-5D)
   or adapted (EDSS) for inclusion in an online survey platform.
   Recruitment was directed at people with MS via the MS Society mailing
   list and social media platforms, as well as in traditional media. The
   economic costing was primarily conducted using a bottom-up' methodology,
   and national estimates were achieved using prevalence-based'
   extrapolation.
   Results: A total of 594 people completed the survey in full. The sample
   had geographic, disease, and demographic characteristics indicating good
   representativeness. At an individual level, average societal cost was
   estimated at (sic)47,683; the average annual costs for those with mild,
   moderate, and severe MS were calculated as (sic)34,942, (sic)57,857, and
   (sic)100,554, respectively. For a total Irish MS population of 9,000,
   the total societal costs of MS amounted to (sic)429m. Direct costs
   accounted for just 30\% of the total societal costs, indirect costs
   amounted to 50\% of the total, and intangible or QoL costs represented
   20\%. The societal cost associated with a relapse in the sample is
   estimated as (sic)2,438.
   Limitations and conclusions: The findings highlight that up to 70\% of
   the total costs associated with MS are not routinely counted. These
   hidden costs are higher in Ireland than the rest of Europe, due in part
   to significantly lower levels of workforce participation, a higher
   likelihood of permanent workforce withdrawal, and higher levels of
   informal care needs. The relationship between disease progression and
   costs emphasize the societal importance of managing and slowing the
   progression of the illness.},

Abstract = {Objectives Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies across occupations;
   however, investigation into factors underlying differential risk is
   limited. We aimed to estimate the total effect of occupation on
   SARS-CoV-2 serological status, whether this is mediated by workplace
   close contact, and how exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces varied
   across occupations. Methods We used data from a subcohort (n=3775) of
   adults in the UK-based Virus Watch cohort study who were tested for
   SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (indicating natural infection).
   We used logistic decomposition to investigate the relationship between
   occupation, contact and seropositivity, and logistic regression to
   investigate exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces. Results
   Seropositivity was 17.1\% among workers with daily close contact vs
   10.0\% for those with no work-related close contact. Compared with other
   professional occupations, healthcare, indoor trade/process/plant,
   leisure/personal service, and transport/mobile machine workers had
   elevated adjusted total odds of seropositivity (1.80 (1.03 to 3.14) -
   2.46 (1.82 to 3.33)). Work-related contact accounted for a variable part
   of increased odds across occupations (1.04 (1.01 to 1.08) - 1.23 (1.09
   to 1.40)). Occupations with raised odds of infection after accounting
   for work-related contact also had greater exposure to poorly ventilated
   workplaces. Conclusions Work-related close contact appears to contribute
   to occupational variation in seropositivity. Reducing contact in
   workplaces is an important COVID-19 control measure.},

Abstract = {Background Vaginoplasty is a gender-affirming surgery that is medically
   necessary for some transfeminine individuals. Little research exists
   describing vaginal health after the initial recovery from surgery, and
   evidence-based guidelines for vaginal care practices are unavailable.Aim
   The study sought to describe self-reported gynecological concerns and
   vaginal care practices among transfeminine persons who have undergone
   vaginoplasty.Methods A total of 60 transfeminine participants 18+ years
   of age, living in Canada, and who had undergone vaginoplasty at least 1
   year prior were recruited through social media, community groups,
   healthcare provider referrals, and study recontact. Participants
   completed a cross-sectional, online questionnaire detailing
   demographics, gynecological concerns, and genital practices and
   exposures. Hierarchical clustering was used to group participants based
   on behavioral practices and exposures. Associations between clusters and
   gynecological concerns were assessed.Outcomes Outcomes included
   self-reported gynecological concerns within the past year, recent vulvar
   or vaginal symptoms (past 30 days), and behavioral practices/exposures,
   including douching with varied products and dilating.Results
   Participants reported a variety of concerns in the past year, including
   urinary tract infection (13\%) and internal hair regrowth (23\%). More
   than half (57\%) had experienced at least 1 recent vaginal symptom, most
   commonly malodor (27\%) and vaginal bleeding (21\%). Of participants,
   48\% were dilating weekly and 52\% reported douching in the past 30
   days. Four distinct clusters of vaginal practices/exposures were
   identified: limited exposures; dilating, no douching; dilating and
   douching; and diverse exposures. No significant associations between
   cluster membership and gynecological concerns were identified, though
   cluster membership was significantly associated with surgical center (P
   = .03). Open-text write-ins provided descriptions of symptoms and
   symptom management strategies.Clinical Implications The results provide
   insight for clinicians on common patient-reported gynecological concerns
   and current vaginal care practices and exposures, including symptom
   management strategies.Strengths and Limitations This was the first study
   to investigate vaginal health and genital practices/exposures among a
   community sample of transfeminine individuals. As participants
   self-enrolled for a detailed survey and swab collection, individuals
   experiencing concerns were likely overrepresented.Conclusion
   Transfeminine individuals reported a range of gynecological concerns
   outside of the surgical healing period. Genital practices/exposures
   varied across clusters, but no clear associations between clusters and
   symptoms were identified; instead, practice/exposure clusters were
   dependent on where the individual underwent vaginoplasty. There is a
   need for evidence to inform diagnostics, treatments, and vaginal care
   guidelines to support vaginal health.},

Title = {A crowdsourced intervention to promote hepatitis B and C testing among
   men who have sex with men in China: study protocol for a nationwide
   online randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization recommends all men who have
   sex with men (MSM) receive Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus
   (HCV) testing. MSM in China are a high-risk group for HBV and HCV
   infection, but test uptake is low. Crowdsourcing invites a large group
   to solve a problem and then shares the solution with the public. This
   nationwide online randomized controlled trial will evaluate the
   effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention to increase HBV and HCV
   testing among MSM in China.
   Methods: Seven hundred MSM will be recruited through social media
   operated by MSM organizations in China. Eligible participants will be
   born biologically male, age 16 years or older, report previous anal sex
   with another man, and reside in China. After completing a baseline
   online survey, participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or
   control arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will include
   two components: (1) a multimedia component will deliver two videos and
   two images promoting HBV and HCV testing developed through a
   crowdsourcing contest in China; (2) a participatory component will
   invite men to submit suggestions for how to improve crowdsourced videos
   and images. The control arm will not view any images or videos and will
   not be invited to submit suggestions. All participants will be offered
   reimbursement for HBV and HCV testing costs. The primary outcome is HBV
   and HCV test uptake confirmed through electronic submission of test
   report photos within four weeks of enrolment. Secondary outcomes include
   self-reported HBV and HCV test uptake, HBV vaccination uptake, and
   change in stigma toward people living with HBV after four weeks. Primary
   and secondary outcomes will be calculated using intention to treat and
   as-exposed analyses and compared using two-sided 95\% confidence
   intervals.
   Discussion: Few previous studies have evaluated interventions to
   increase HBV and HCV testing in middle-income countries with a high
   burden of hepatitis. Delivering a crowdsourced intervention using social
   media is a novel approach to increasing hepatitis testing rates. HBV and
   HCV test uptake will be confirmed through test report photos, avoiding
   the limitations of self-reported testing outcomes.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {98},
Number = {4},
Pages = {239-244},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in population health research, which uses
   methods based on artificial intelligence. Such research draws on a range
   of clinical and non-clinical data to make predictions about health
   risks, such as identifying epidemics and monitoring disease spread. Much
   of this research uses data from social media in the public domain or
   anonymous secondary health data and is therefore exempt from ethics
   committee scrutiny. While the ethical use and regulation of
   digital-based research has been discussed, little attention has been
   given to the ethics governance of such research in higher education
   institutions in the field of population health. Such governance is
   essential to how scholars make ethical decisions and provides assurance
   to the public that researchers are acting ethically. We propose a
   process of ethics governance for population health research in higher
   education institutions. The approach takes the form of review after the
   research has been completed, with particular focus on the role
   artificial intelligence algorithms play in augmenting decision-making.
   The first layer of review could be national, open-science repositories
   for open-source algorithms and affiliated data or information which are
   developed during research. The second layer would be a sector-specific
   validation of the research processes and algorithms by a committee of
   academics and stakeholders with a wide range of expertise across
   disciplines. The committee could be created as an off-shoot of an
   already functioning national oversight body or health technology
   assessment organization. We use case studies of good practice to explore
   how this process might operate.},

Title = {From Information Seekers to Innovators: Qualitative Analysis Describing
   Experiences of the Second Generation of E-Patients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Background: Current health care systems are rarely designed to meet the
   needs of people living with chronic conditions. However, some patients
   and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to
   redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as
   e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the internet for
   finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the
   first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own
   health data and appears to be more innovative.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the second generation
   of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their
   self-care and health care.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with
   chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited
   through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the
   framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the
   self-determination theory-autonomy, relatedness, and competence-at the
   outset.
   Results: Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their
   self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as
   well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as
   using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to
   health care professionals and medical students, working as professional
   peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with
   innovations, and being active on social media. When interaction with
   health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the
   participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong
   relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and
   learning experiences with peers. Their autonomy was important but was
   sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for
   them.
   Conclusions: Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants
   frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second
   generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they
   learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital
   tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments
   comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the
   health care system is not prepared to support them under these new
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly connecting the most
   intimate parts of our daily lives to the Internet via connected
   ecosystems of hardware and software products. However, how these
   ecosystems operate and, in particular their impact on user privacy
   remains an open question. In this paper, we explore this question by
   analysing IFTTT, a popular task automation platform based on
   trigger-action programming. Through IFTTT, end users can easily create
   applets, aka recipes, that glue different IoT devices and online
   services together. While IFTTT brings many online services together,
   such as social media and mobile applications, its use for IoT automation
   is appealing for many users. Hence, analyzing the IFTTT ecosystem over
   time, enables us to study IoT trends and adaptation rate in realuser
   settings. In this paper we describe the IFTTT evolution by analyzing two
   existing IFTTT data sets and compiling a recent data set of its services
   and applets. This analysis exposes new platform characteristics and
   trends. Our data set, which was collected in October 2021, contains data
   about 694 services, 50 898 applets, and 7 003 endpoints. It also
   contains data about the information exchange in the platform via
   ingredients. In addition, we identify applets that might impose privacy
   risks for their users by detecting sensitive information flows in the
   system. We find that almost 30\% of installations in the platform
   involve applets that utilize privacy-sensitive information such as
   users' personal information, location, and health data. This trend is
   consistently present in the three analyzed data sets and, disturbingly,
   increases over time.},

Title = {Public willingness to participate in personalized health research and
   biobanking: A large-scale Swiss survey},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public's willingness,
   attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research
   participation by providing health information and biological material.
   The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we
   received 5,156 responses (34.1\% response rate). The majority of
   respondents were aware of research using human biological samples
   (71.0\%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research
   (62.4\%). Of all respondents, 53.6\% indicated that they would be
   willing to participate in a personalized health research project.
   Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated,
   non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector.
   Respondents were more willing to provide `traditional' types of health
   data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as
   opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the
   return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for
   which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside
   general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using
   data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and
   re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality
   breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The
   findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research
   institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and
   developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the
   public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives
   engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement
   activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data
   sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health
   research efforts.},

Title = {Framework for a Community Health Observing System for the Gulf of Mexico
   Region: Preparing for Future Disasters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) region is prone to disasters, including
   recurrent oil spills, hurricanes, floods, industrial accidents, harmful
   algal blooms, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. The GoM and other
   regions of the U.S. lack sufficient baseline health information to
   identify, attribute, mitigate, and facilitate prevention of major health
   effects of disasters. Developing capacity to assess adverse human health
   consequences of future disasters requires establishment of a
   comprehensive, sustained community health observing system, similar to
   the extensive and well-established environmental observing systems. We
   propose a system that combines six levels of health data domains,
   beginning with three existing, national surveys and studies plus three
   new nested, longitudinal cohort studies. The latter are the unique and
   most important parts of the system and are focused on the coastal
   regions of the five GoM States. A statistically representative sample of
   participants is proposed for the new cohort studies, stratified to
   ensure proportional inclusion of urban and rural populations and with
   additional recruitment as necessary to enroll participants from
   particularly vulnerable or under-represented groups. Secondary data
   sources such as syndromic surveillance systems, electronic health
   records, national community surveys, environmental exposure databases,
   social media, and remote sensing will inform and augment the collection
   of primary data. Primary data sources will include participant-provided
   information via questionnaires, clinical measures of mental and physical
   health, acquisition of biological specimens, and wearable health
   monitoring devices. A suite of biomarkers may be derived from biological
   specimens for use in health assessments, including calculation of
   allostatic load, a measure of cumulative stress. The framework also
   addresses data management and sharing, participant retention, and system
   governance. The observing system is designed to continue indefinitely to
   ensure that essential pre-, during-, and post-disaster health data are
   collected and maintained. It could also provide a model/vehicle for
   effective health observation related to infectious disease pandemics
   such as COVID-19. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive,
   disaster-focused health observing system such as the one proposed here
   currently in existence or planned elsewhere. Significant strengths of
   the GoM Community Health Observing System (CHOS) are its longitudinal
   cohorts and ability to adapt rapidly as needs arise and new technologies
   develop.},

Abstract = {Disasters and disease outbreaks have long been a catalyst for innovative
   applications of emerging technologies. The urgent need to respond to an
   emergency leads to resourceful uses of the technologies at hand.
   However, the best and most cost-effective use of new technologies is to
   prevent disease and improve resilience. In this paper, the authors
   present a range of approaches through which both opportunities can be
   grasped.
   Global connectedness enables more data to be collected and processed in
   emergencies, especially with the rise of open-source data, including
   social media. In general, the poorest and most remote populations are
   most vulnerable to disaster. However, with smaller, faster, smarter,
   cheaper and more connected technology, reliable, efficient, and targeted
   response and recovery can be provided. Initially, crowdsourcing was used
   to find people, map affected areas, and determine resource allocation.
   This led to the generation of an overwhelming amount of data, and the
   need to extract valuable information from that data in a timely manner.
   As technology evolved, organisations started outsourcing many tasks,
   first to other people, then to machines. Since the volume of data
   generated outpaces human capacity, data analysis is being automated
   using artificial intelligence and machine learning, which furthers our
   abilities in predictive analytics. As we move towards prevention rather
   than remediation, information collection and processing must become
   faster and more efficient while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, these
   new strategies and technologies can help us to move forwards, by
   integrating layers of human, veterinary, public, and environmental
   health data for a One Health approach.},

Title = {Cardiovascular Safety of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Team USA Athletes},
Journal = {SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background: Despite reassuring scientific data, the lay press and social
   media continue to propagate largely unsubstantiated claims that a
   significant number of athletes have died from cardiovascular
   complications related to COVID-19 vaccines. The present study sought to
   determine the incidence of COVID-19 vaccine cardiovascular complications
   in Team USA athletes.Hypothesis: It was predicted that there would be a
   low incidence of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 vaccination
   in Team USA athletes.Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.Level
   of Evidence: Level 4.Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on
   the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee electronic medical
   record, inclusive of athletes who represented Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo
   and 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games, for COVID-19 vaccine
   cardiac complications including sudden cardiac arrest/death,
   myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis. Vaccination status (ie,
   fully vaccinated, yes or no), date of vaccination and eligible boosters,
   and type of vaccination during the study period were abstracted from the
   electronic medical record.Results: A total of 1229 athletes represented
   Team USA during the 2020 Tokyo (Olympic, 697; Paralympic, 237) and 2022
   Beijing Games (Olympic, 229; Paralympic, 66). For the 2020 Tokyo Games,
   73.8\% of Olympians and 80.6\% of Paralympians with available
   vaccination status had completed a primary vaccine series. For the 2022
   Beijing Games, 100\% of Olympians and Paralympians with available
   vaccination status were fully vaccinated. No athletes suffered sudden
   cardiac arrest/death or were diagnosed with myocarditis, pericarditis,
   or myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination.Conclusion: The data
   demonstrate an overall willingness of elite athletes to receive
   recommended COVID-19 vaccination coupled with a complete absence of
   vaccine-related cardiac complications in >1 year of follow-up.Clinical
   Relevance: Supposedly, this is the first study to investigate the
   incidence of COVID-19 vaccine cardiovascular complications in elite
   athletes. These data are an important first step to better inform
   cardiologists and sports medicine physicians who care for elite
   athletes.},

Title = {Global Prevalence and Drivers of Dental Students' COVID-19 Vaccine
   Hesitancy},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Acceleration of mass vaccination strategies is the only
   pathway to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals and
   students have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines. This
   study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of dental students globally
   towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for
   students' acceptance levels. Methods: A global cross-sectional study was
   carried out in February 2021 using an online questionnaire. The study
   was liaised by the scientific committee of the International Association
   of Dental Students (IADS), and data were collected through the national
   and local coordinators of IADS member organizations. The dependent
   variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and the
   independent variables included demographic characteristics,
   COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of COVID-19 vaccine-related
   attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. Results: A total of 6639 students
   from 22 countries, representing all world regions, responded to the
   questionnaire properly. Their mean age was 22.1 +/- 2.8 (17-40) years,
   and the majority were females (70.5\%), in clinical years (66.8\%), and
   from upper-middle-income economies (45.7\%). In general, 22.5\% of
   dental students worldwide were hesitant, and 13.9\% rejected COVID-19
   vaccines. The students in low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) economies
   had significantly higher levels of vaccine hesitancy compared to their
   peers in upper-middle- and high-income (UMHI) economies (30.4\% vs.
   19.8\%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: The global acceptance level of dental
   students for COVID-19 vaccines was suboptimal, and their worrisome level
   of vaccine hesitancy was influenced by the socioeconomic context where
   the dental students live and study. The media and social media, public
   figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of
   governments and the pharmaceutical industry were barriers to
   vaccination. The findings of this study call for further implementation
   of epidemiology (infectious diseases) education within undergraduate
   dental curricula.},

Abstract = {Introduction The latest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
   epidemiology survey in China estimated that there were 99 million
   potential COPD patients in the country, the majority of whom are
   undiagnosed. Screening for COPD in primary care settings is of vital
   importance for China, but it is not known which strategy would be the
   most suitable for adoption in primary care. Studies have been conducted
   to test the accuracy of questionnaires, expiratory peak flow meters and
   microspirometers to screen for COPD, but no study has directly evaluated
   and compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these methods
   in the Chinese setting.
   Methods and analysis We present the protocol for a multicentre
   cross-sectional study, to be conducted in eight community hospitals from
   four cities among Chinese adults aged 40 years or older to investigate
   the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different case-finding
   methods for COPD, and determine the test performance of individual and
   combinations of screening tests and strategies in comparison with
   quality diagnostic spirometry. Index tests are screening questionnaires
   (COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), COPD Assessment in Primary Care To
   Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk
   Questionnaire (CAPTURE), symptom-based questionnaire, COPD Screening
   Questionnaire (COPD-SQ)), microspirometer and peak flow. Each
   participant will complete all of these tests in one assessment. The
   primary analysis will compare the performance of a screening
   questionnaire with a handheld device. Secondary analyses will include
   the comparative performance of each index test, as well as a comparison
   of strategies where we use a screening questionnaire and a handheld
   device. Approximately 2000 participants will be recruited over 9 to 12
   months.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by Peking
   University Hospital and University of Birmingham. All study participants
   will provide written informed consent. Study results will be published
   in appropriate journal and presented at national and international
   conferences, as well as relevant social media and various
   community/stakeholder engagement activities.},

Abstract = {Introduction Ischaemia/reperfusion injuries (IRIs) are associated with
   poorer survival of kidney grafts from expanded criteria donors.
   Preclinical studies have shown that mineralocorticoid receptor
   antagonists (MRAs) prevent acute and chronic post-ischaemic renal
   dysfunction by limiting IRI. However, data concerning the safety of MRAs
   in brain-dead donor patients are scarce. We seek to investigate the
   tolerance of MRAs on the haemodynamics in this population.Methods and
   analysis CANREO-PMO is a randomised, controlled, single-centre,
   double-blind study. Brain-dead organ donors hospitalised in intensive
   care are randomised 1:1 after consent to receive 200 mg potassium
   canrenoate or its matching placebo every 6 hours until organ
   procurement. The primary outcome is a hierarchical composite endpoint
   that includes: (1) cardiocirculatory arrest, (2) the impossibility of
   kidney procurement, (3) the average hourly dose of
   norepinephrine/epinephrine between randomisation and departure to the
   operating room, and (4) the average hourly volume of crystalloids and/or
   colloids received. Thirty-six patients will be included. The secondary
   endpoints evaluated among the graft recipients are the: (1) vital status
   of the kidney graft recipients and serum creatinine level with estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to Chronic Kidney Disease
   Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) at 3 months after renal
   transplantation, (2) percentage of patients dependent on dialysis and/or
   with an estimated GFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at 3 months, (3) vital status
   of the kidney graft recipients at 3 months, and (4) vital status of the
   kidney graft recipients and creatinine levels (in mu mol/L), with the
   estimated GFR according to CKD-EPI (in mL/min/1.73 m(2)), at 1 year, 3
   years and 10 years after transplantation.Ethics and dissemination This
   trial has full ethical approval (Comite de Protection des Personnes: CPP
   Ouest II-ANGERS, France), and the written consent of relatives will be
   obtained. Results will be reported at conferences, peer-reviewed
   publications and using social media channels.},

Title = {CURRENT PERSPECTIVE ON DETERMINANTS AND DETERRENTS OF COVID-19},
Journal = {ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3653-3660},
Abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has left several
   countries grappling with a devastating pandemic. Developing an effective
   COVID-19 vaccine may be possible but there are significant issues with
   public distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Public health efforts aimed at
   testing symptomatic patients, and other preventative measures, however,
   these efforts have been unable to significantly curtail the pandemic.
   There is a paucity of research that comprehensively focuses on
   determinants and deterrents to identify critical knowledge gaps. This
   review aims to focus efforts on strategies to contain the virus.
   Materials and methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, and archives of preprints
   were searched with the following terms ``COVID-19 ``, ``SARS-CoV-2{''},
   ``2019-nCoV{''}, ``epidemiology{''}, ``determinants{''}, and
   ``deterrents.{''} The reference lists of articles were examined for
   relevant studies.
   Results: All age groups are susceptible and can transmit the virus.
   Individuals with severe outcomes include but are not limited to age 65
   years or older, male sex, ethnic minorities, and the presence of
   comorbidities. Misinformation on social media and other traditional
   information sources is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and
   mortality. Indoor and outdoor aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2,
   asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic' transmission, and incubation period of
   over 14 days in some infected individuals have been reported. Widespread
   rapid SARS-CoV-2 population screening and contact tracing are methods of
   effective containment including proper use of facemasks in crowded
   outdoor or indoor spaces, installation of HEPA filters, regular hand
   hygiene, and physical distancing measures. Simple cost-effective
   measures include opening doors and windows of buildings where possible.
   Conclusion: Achieving herd immunity with a vaccine may be difficult
   because of misinformation. A potential incubation period of over 14 days
   is the bane of Covid-19 current control strategies. More research is
   needed including investigating the long-term effects of Covid-19
   particularly in children, and fecal aerosol transmission. Evidence-based
   information and the identified infection prevention measures should be
   advocated.},

Title = {A 4-Year Analysis of the Incidence of Injuries Among CrossFit-Trained
   Participants},
Journal = {ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background: High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a new training
   modality that merges high-intensity exercise with functional
   (multijoint) movements. Even though others exist, CrossFit training has
   emerged as the most common form of HIFT. Recently, several reports have
   linked CrossFit training to severe injuries and/or life-threatening
   conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis. Empirical evidence regarding the
   safety of this training modality is currently limited.
   Purpose: To examine the incidence of injuries related to CrossFit
   participation and to estimate the rate of injuries in a large
   cross-sectional convenience sample of CrossFit participants from around
   the world.
   Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
   Methods: A total of 3049 participants who reported engaging in CrossFit
   training between 2013 and 2017 were surveyed.
   Results: A portion (30.5\%) of the participants surveyed reported
   experiencing an injury over the previous 12 months because of their
   participation in CrossFit training. Injuries to the shoulders (39\%),
   back (36\%), knees (15\%), elbows (12\%), and wrists (11\%) were most
   common for both male and female participants. The greatest number of
   injuries occurred among those who participated in CrossFit training 3 to
   5 days per week (chi(2) = 12.51; P = .0019). Overall, and based on the
   assumed maximum number of workout hours per week, the injury rate was
   0.27 per 1000 hours (females: 0.28; males: 0.26), whereas the assumed
   minimum number of workout hours per week resulted in an injury rate of
   0.74 per 1000 hours (females: 0.78; males: 0.70).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CrossFit training is relatively
   safe compared with more traditional training modalities. However, it
   seems that those within their first year of training as well as those
   who engage in this training modality less than 3 days per week and/or
   participate in less than 3 workouts per week are at a greater risk for
   injuries.},

Title = {Myocardial infarction and stroke subsequent to urinary tract infection
   (MISSOURI): protocol for a self-controlled case series using linked
   electronic health records},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction There is increasing interest in the relationship between
   acute infections and acute cardiovascular events. Most previous research
   has focused on understanding whether the risk of acute cardiovascular
   events increases following a respiratory tract infection. The
   relationship between urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute
   cardiovascular events is less well studied. Therefore, the aim of this
   study is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between UTI
   and acute myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.
   Methods and analysis We will undertake a self-controlled case series
   study using linked anonymised general practice, hospital admission and
   microbiology data held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage
   (SAIL) Databank. Self-controlled case series is a relatively novel study
   design where individuals act as their own controls, thereby inherently
   controlling for time-invariant confounders. Only individuals who
   experience an exposure and outcome of interest are included.
   We will identify individuals in the SAIL Databank who have a hospital
   admission record for acute MI or stroke during the study period of
   2010-2020. Individuals will need to be aged 30-100 during the study
   period and be Welsh residents for inclusion. UTI will be identified
   using general practice, microbiology and hospital admissions data. We
   will calculate the incidence of MI and stroke in predefined risk periods
   following an UTI and in `baseline' periods (without UTI exposure) and
   use conditional Poisson regression models to derive incidence rate
   ratios.

Title = {A dynamic data structure for temporal reachability with unsorted contact
   insertions},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Temporal graphs represent interactions between entities over the time.
   These interactions may be direct (a contact between two nodes at some
   time instant), or indirect, through sequences of contacts called
   temporal paths (journeys). Deciding whether an entity can reach another
   through a journey is useful for various applications in communication
   networks and epidemiology, among other fields. In this paper, we present
   a data structure that maintains temporal reachability information under
   the addition of new contacts. In contrast to previous works, the
   contacts can be inserted in an arbitrary order-in particular,
   non-chronologically-which corresponds to systems where the information
   is collected a posteriori (e.g., when trying to reconstruct
   contamination chains among people). The main component of our data
   structure is a generalization of transitive closure called timed
   transitive closure (TTC), which allows us to maintain reachability
   information relative to all nested time intervals, without storing all
   these intervals, nor the journeys themselves. Let n be the number of
   nodes and tau be the number of timestamps in the lifetime of the
   temporal graph. Our data structure answers reachability queries
   regarding the existence of a journey from a given node to another within
   a given time interval in time O(log tau); it has a worst-case insertion
   time of O(n(2) log tau); and it can reconstruct a valid journey that
   witnesses reachability in time O(k log tau), where k < n is the maximum
   number of contacts of this journey. Finally, the space complexity of our
   reachability data structure is O(n(2)tau), which remains within the
   worst-case size of the temporal graph itself.},

Title = {Short-term improvement of mental health after a COVID-19 vaccination},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Introduction The role of COVID-19 vaccination on the mental health of
   the general population remains poorly understood. This study aims to
   assess the short-term change in depressive and anxiety symptoms in
   relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults.
   Methods A prospective study of 7,925 individuals recruited from ongoing
   cohort studies at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, or
   through social media campaigns, with monthly data collections on
   self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to
   October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021.
   Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (defined as a
   self-reported total score of >= 10 in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively) was
   calculated one month before, one month after the first dose, and, if
   applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not
   vaccinated or choosing not to report vaccination status (unvaccinated
   individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with
   2-month intervals in-between based on data availability.
   Results 5,079 (64.1\%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19
   vaccine, 1,977 (24.9\%) received one dose, 305 (3.9\%) were not
   vaccinated, and 564 (7.1\%) chose not to report vaccination status.
   There was a lower prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among
   vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated individuals, especially after the
   second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the
   prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was lower after both first
   (aRR = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression; aRR = 0.81, 95\%CI
   0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR = 0.79, 95\%CI 0.73-0.85 for
   depression; aRR = 0.73, 95\%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared to
   before vaccination. Similar results were observed among individuals
   receiving only one dose (aRR = 0.76, 95\%CI 0.68-0.84 for depression;
   aRR = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.72-0.94 for anxiety), comparing after first dose to
   before vaccination.
   Conclusions We observed a short-term improvement in depressive and
   anxiety symptoms among adults receiving COVID-19 vaccines in the current
   pandemic. Our findings provide new evidence to support outreach
   campaigns targeting hesitant groups.},

Title = {The Sentiment Analysis of Tweets as a New Tool to Measure Public
   Perception of Male Erectile and Ejaculatory Dysfunctions},

Abstract = {Introduction: Twitter is a social network based on ``tweets,{''} short
   messages of up to 280 characters. Social media has been investigated in
   health care research to ascertain positive or negative feelings
   associated with several conditions but never in sexual medicine.
   Aim: To assess perceptions related to erectile dysfunction (ED) and
   premature ejaculation (PE) among Twitter users.
   Methods: Data collection was performed on a daily basis between May
   24-October 9, 2018 (138 days) via an automated script. Data collection
   was then performed after data cleaning. The statistical software R and
   the rtweet packages were used in both phases.
   Results: We collected 11,000 unique tweets for PE and 30,546 unique
   tweets for ED. After data cleaning, we analyzed 7,020 tweets on PE and
   22,648 tweets on ED by analyzing the most recurring words and the
   clusters describing word associations. The most popular words for ED
   were ``Treatment,{''} ``Health,{''} and ``Viagra,{''} whereas ``Sex,{''}
   ``Sexual,{''} and ``Cure{''} were the top 3 for PE. Word clusters
   suggest the presence of some recurring themes, such as medical terms
   being grouped together. Additionally, tweets reflect the general
   feelings triggered by specific events, such as pieces of news pertaining
   to sexual dysfunctions.
   Clinical Implications: Tweets on sexual dysfunctions are posted every
   day, with more tweets on ED than on PE. Treatment is among the chief
   topics discussed for both conditions, although health concerns differ
   between PE and DE tweets.
   Strength and Limitations: This is the first analysis conducted on Tweets
   in the field of andrology and sexual medicine. A significant number of
   tweets were collected and analyzed. However, quantitative assessment of
   the sentiment was not feasible.
   Conclusion: Sexual dysfunctions are openly discussed on social media,
   and Twitter analysis could help understand the needs and interests of
   the general population on these themes. Copyright (C) 2019, The Authors.

Title = {Linking parasitism to network centrality and the impact of sampling bias
   in its interpretation},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Group living is beneficial for individuals, but also comes with costs.
   One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission
   because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often
   associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social
   structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection
   and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the
   links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in
   primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only
   adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here,
   we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and
   an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole
   group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact
   of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test:
   (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of
   partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of
   social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection
   intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what
   extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might
   influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network
   analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over
   three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out
   simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group
   level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth
   infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult
   females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of
   this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical
   significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were
   removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group
   network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an
   effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that
   sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects
   involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting
   earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social
   networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations
   for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications
   for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health
   interventions.},

Abstract = {AIMS: To empower a large whanau (extended family) with a history of
   severe premature heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
   METHODS: After broad consultation a Hui was held to discuss how to
   better manage this issue to ensure present and future generations were
   appropriately screened and treated.
   RESULTS: A closed social media page with detailed information on how to
   manage and screen FH that includes a family tree (for those who consent)
   has been created. The whanau, facilitated by health professionals, have
   ownership of their health. This has led to an uptake of screening and
   treatment for FH with whanau who are now able to inform local health
   professionals about their disorder.
   CONCLUSION: FH is the most common dominant genetic disorder in humans
   and causes premature heart disease and death. Current approaches are
   dependent on index patients presenting for cascade screening and do not
   incorporate the needs and views of the extended whanau. Establishing a
   partnership with the whanau and giving back control of health
   information is crucial to ensure equity. A national systematic programme
   is also needed to manage this condition with important health outcomes
   that can be averted if treated from a young age.},

Title = {Visual topic models for healthcare data clustering},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {545-562},
Month = {2021 JUN},
Abstract = {Social media is a great source to search health-related topics for
   envisages solutions towards healthcare. Topic models originated from
   Natural Language Processing that is receiving much attention in
   healthcare areas because of interpretability and its decision making,
   which motivated us to develop visual topic models. Topic models are used
   for the extraction of health topics for analyzing discriminative and
   coherent latent features of tweet documents in healthcare applications.
   Discovering the number of topics in topic models is an important issue.
   Sometimes, users enable an incorrect number of topics in traditional
   topic models, which leads to poor results in health data clustering. In
   such cases, proper visualizations are essential to extract information
   for identifying cluster trends. To aid in the visualization of topic
   clouds and health tendencies in the document collection, we present
   hybrid topic modeling techniques by integrating traditional topic models
   with visualization procedures. We believe proposed visual topic models
   viz., Visual Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual intJNon-negative Matrix
   Factorization (VintJNMF), and Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic
   Indexing (VPLSI) are promising methods for extracting tendency of health
   topics from various sources in healthcare data clustering. Standard and
   benchmark social health datasets are used in an experimental study to
   demonstrate the efficiency of proposed models concerning clustering
   accuracy (CA), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), precision (P),
   recall (R), F-Score (F) measures and computational complexities. VNMF
   visual model performs significantly at an increased rate of 32.4\% under
   cosine based metric in the display of visual clusters and an increased
   rate of 35-40\% in performance measures compared to other visual methods
   on different number of health topics.},

Title = {A privacy-preserving cryptosystem for IoT E-healthcare},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {527},
Pages = {493-510},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Privacy preservation has become a prerequisite for modern applications
   in the cloud, social media, Internet of things (IoT), and E- healthcare
   systems. In general, health and medical data contain images and medical
   information about the patients and such personal data should be kept
   confidential in order to maintain the patients' privacy. Due to
   limitations in digital data properties, traditional encryption schemes
   over textual and structural one-dimension data cannot be applied
   directly to e-health data. In addition, when personal data are sent over
   the open channels, patients may lose privacy of data contents. Hence, a
   secure lightweight keyframe extraction method is highly required to
   ensure timely, correct, and privacy-preserving e-health services.
   Besides this, it is inherently difficult to achieve a satisfied level of
   security in a cost-effective way while considering the constraints of
   real-time e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a privacy
   preserving chaos-based encryption cryptosystem for patients' privacy
   protection. The proposed cryptosystem can protect patient's images from
   a compromised broker. In particular, we propose a fast probabilistic
   cryptosystem to secure medical keyframes that are extracted from
   wireless capsule endoscopy procedure using a prioritization method. The
   encrypted images produced by our cryptosystem exhibits randomness
   behavior, which guarantee computational efficiency as well as a highest
   level of security for the keyframes against various attacks.
   Furthermore, it processes the medical data without leaking any
   information, thus preserving patient's privacy by allowing only
   authorized users for decryption. The experimental results and security
   analysis from different perspectives verify the excellent performance of
   our encryption cryptosystem compared to other recent encryption schemes.

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic raises health issues worldwide.
   Infected pregnant women may have negative mental health outcomes, but
   little is known about their emotional experiences.
   Aim: We aimed to understand the experience of women infected with
   COVID-19 during pregnancy, regarding their feelings, their
   relationships, and the influence of social media.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among 22 women infected with
   COVID-19 during pregnancy, from a tertiary hospital during the first
   wave of the pandemic in Brazil (May-August 2020). We applied
   semi-directed interviews, sociodemographic and health data sheets, and
   field diaries. We built the sample purposefully. Interviews were
   audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis and
   discussed data considering the health psychology framework.
   Results: We created five categories following a timeline perspective,
   from before infection to the experience after recovering. Pregnant women
   were resistant to believing the diagnosis. They described a fear of
   serious symptoms or death, concerns about the fetus, sorrow from being
   isolated, and worries about stigma. Family relationships were ambiguous,
   generating either support or tension. The attachment to the health team
   through telemedicine or support during hospitalization produced a
   feeling of security.
   Conclusions: Participants psychologically denied the COVID-19 diagnosis
   and did not accomplish isolation properly, even upon medical
   recommendations. The illness may produce a traumatic experience,
   regardless of mild or severe symptoms, but family/friend support and
   contact with the health team helped them to cope. We offer important
   insights for the clinical approach and future research, emphasizing that
   infected pregnant women require emotional support. (c) 2021 Australian

Abstract = {Objective: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are underrepresented
   in research. We sought to create a digital research platform to engage,
   recruit, and retain SGM people in a national, longitudinal, dynamic,
   cohort study (The PRIDE Study) of SGM health.
   Materials and Methods: We partnered with design and development firms
   and engaged SGM community members to build a secure, cloud-based,
   containerized, microservices-based, feature-rich, research platform. We
   created PRIDEnet, a national network of individuals and organizations
   that actively engaged SGM communities in all stages of health research.
   The PRIDE Study participants were recruited via in-person outreach,
   communications to PRIDEnet constituents, social media advertising, and
   word-of-mouth. Participants completed surveys to report demographic as
   well as physical, mental, and social health data.
   Results: We built a secure digital research platform with engaging
   functionality that engaged SGM people and recruited and retained 13 731
   diverse individuals in 2 years. A sizeable sample of 3813 gender
   minority people (32.8\% of cohort) were recruited despite representing
   only approximately 0.6\% of the population. Participants engaged with
   the platform and completed comprehensive annual surveys-including
   questions about sensitive and stigmatizing topics-to create a data
   resource and join a cohort for ongoing SGM health research.
   Discussion: With an appealing digital platform, recruitment and
   engagement in online-only longitudinal cohort studies are possible.
   Participant engagement with meaningful, bidirectional relationships
   creates stakeholders and enables study cocreation. Research about
   effective tactics to engage, recruit, and maintain active participation
   from all communities is needed.
   Conclusion: This digital research platform successfully recruited and
   engaged diverse SGM participants in The PRIDE Study. A similar approach
   may be successful in partnership with other underrepresented and
   vulnerable populations.},

Title = {Improving Prehospital Protocol Adherence Using Bundled Educational
   Interventions},

Abstract = {Background: Seizures and anaphylaxis are life-threatening conditions
   that require immediate treatment in the prehospital setting. There is
   variation in treatment of pediatric prehospital patients for both
   anaphylaxis and seizures. This educational study was done to improve
   compliance with pediatric prehospital protocols, educate prehospital
   providers and decrease variation in care. Objective: To improve the
   quality of care for children with seizures and anaphylaxis in the
   prehospital setting using a bundled, multifaceted educational
   intervention. Methods: Evidence-based pediatric prehospital guidelines
   for seizures and anaphylaxis were used to create a curriculum for the
   paramedics in the EMS system. The curriculum included in-person
   training, videos, distribution of decision support tools, and a targeted
   social media campaign to reinforce the evidence-based guidelines.
   Prehospital charts were reviewed for pediatric patients with a chief
   complaint of anaphylaxis or seizures who were transported by paramedics
   to one of ten hospitals, including three children's hospitals, for 8
   months prior to the intervention and eight months following the
   intervention. The primary outcome for seizures was whether midazolam was
   given via the preferred intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes.
   The primary outcome for anaphylaxis was whether IM epinephrine was
   given. Results: A total of 1,402 pediatric patients were transported for
   seizures by paramedics to during the study period. A total of 88
   patients were actively seizing pre-intervention and 93
   post-intervention. Of the actively seizing patients, 52 were given
   midazolam pre-intervention and 62 were given midazolam
   post-intervention. Pre-intervention, 29\% (15/52) of the seizing
   patients received midazolam via the preferred IM or IN routes, compared
   to 74\% (46/62) of the seizing patients post-intervention. A total of 45
   patients with anaphylaxis were transported by paramedics, 30
   pre-intervention and 15 post-intervention. Paramedics administered
   epinephrine to 17\% (5/30) patients pre-intervention and 67\% (10/15)
   patients post-intervention. Conclusion: The use of a bundled,
   multifaceted educational intervention including in-person training,
   decision support tools, and social media improved adherence to updated
   evidence-based pediatric prehospital protocols.},

   Subjects were randomly selected by sharing links on social media groups.
   Any parent with a 3-18-year-old child was included, and children with
   chronic medical illnesses or symptoms of organic GI disorders were
   excluded. Results:Three hundred nineteen subjects were included in the
   final analysis; the prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders
   overall was 6.2\% and the prevalence of functional constipation was
   8.1\%. Conclusions:Functional constipation diagnosis seems to be
   affected by life stressors or a previous viral illness. Seasonal
   variations had minimal effect on functional abdominal pain disorder and
   functional constipation symptom frequency and severity.},

Abstract = {Forest fires in peatlands emit pollutants to the atmosphere, affecting
   public health. Though air quality data and epidemiology information are
   helpful in the management of the environment and public health, they are
   not always available. We aimed to reveal the utility of newspaper
   articles for estimating the public health concerns posed by air
   pollution. Using the database of a local newspaper, Riau Pos, in Riau
   Province of Sumatra, Indonesia, we have studied spatiotemporal
   correlations between publication frequency of newspaper articles
   mentioning search terms relevant to health issues and Fire Radiation
   Power (FRP) of peatland fires. FRP from one of the NASA satellite
   databases has been used as an index of air pollution caused by peatland
   fires. Visibility data for airport operation were also used as an index
   of particulate matter concentrations. The study regions are primarily
   the fire-prone Riau Province and nearby areas in the central area of
   Sumatra, Indonesia, from 2009 to 2018. Newspaper articles related to
   public health are found to be associated with FRP and visibility, or
   regional air pollution.},

Title = {Psychosocial and health behavioural impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on
   adults in the USA: protocol for a longitudinal cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Introduction Although social distancing may help contain the spread of
   COVID-19, the social isolation and loneliness it causes can heighten
   stress, contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and have
   deleterious effects on social relationships. This ongoing longitudinal
   cohort study aims to (1) characterise the psychological, social and
   health behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month
   period in the USA; (2) determine whether these impacts differ for
   certain subgroups based on sociodemographics and other individual-level
   factors; and (3) explore whether there are modifiable factors (eg,
   coping, social support) that moderate the effects of the pandemic over
   time. Methods and analysis Adults (aged >= 18 years) who were fluent in
   either English or Spanish were recruited via social media and invited to
   complete an online survey during the 8-week period from 13 April to 8
   June 2020 (baseline). Follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12
   months after baseline. Data transformations, non-parametric tests or
   other alternative methods will be used when appropriate. Descriptive
   statistics and cross-sectional analyses will be performed. Longitudinal
   associations will be analysed using multilevel modelling with
   time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over
   the study period. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval was
   received from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board
   (H-47505). Overall, this study will provide timely information that can
   be used to inform public health messaging strategies and guide
   development of assessment tools and interventions to support vulnerable
   individuals dealing with the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Gymnastics has a history of high injury incidence rates. However, little
   is known about the injury pathology in young gymnasts. The purpose of
   this study was to fill gaps in the literature by providing insight into
   the injury pathology in gymnasts aged 6 to 17 years. This study was
   retrospective in design, where injury data were collected using a
   Qualtrics questionnaire and distributed via social media. The findings
   revealed that the most common injury site was the lower limb (60.5\%),
   in particular, the ankle/foot (49\%) and knee (27\%). Overuse injuries
   and sprains were most prevalent among the lower limb (25\% and 18.4\%,
   respectively), and gymnasts seemed to have a tendency to train through
   injury with modifications to training. In conclusion, lower limb joint
   sprain and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries in
   youth gymnasts. These injuries were more frequently reported in girls in
   the years associated with peak height velocity and beyond.},

Title = {Does the Saudi Population Have Sufficient Awareness of Vitiligo in
   Southwest Saudi Arabia? A Cross-Sectional Survey, 2022},
Journal = {CLINICS AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Pages = {876-884},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Vitiligo is a common acquired hypopigmentation skin
   condition defined by an idiopathic, gradual, and restricted loss of
   melanin pigment from otherwise healthy-looking skin. The present study
   aims to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of and attitudes toward
   vitiligo among the general population of Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: An observational cross-sectional survey targeting adults of the
   Jazan region was conducted in 2022. The data were collected using an
   electronic questionnaire distributed through social media in the region.
   Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS computer program.
   Knowledge and attitude scores were computed. Results: Most of the
   respondents (83.7\%) had an adequate knowledge level of vitiligo, and
   almost half of the respondents (46.8\%) had a positive attitude toward
   the disease. The majority of the respondents (84.5\%) knew that vitiligo
   is not contagious. However, the majority of the participants (78.6\%)
   did not know that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease. Most of the
   respondents (93.1\%) do not avoid shaking hands with a vitiligo patient
   to prevent infection, accept food prepared by a vitiligo patient
   (69.4\%), accept sharing a plate with a vitiligo patient (73.6\%), and
   accept to be helped by a vitiligo patient (86.7\%). However, about half
   of the participants (50.4\%) refused to marry a person diagnosed with
   vitiligo. The knowledge of vitiligo in the study population was not
   correlated with any of the demographic characters, such as age, gender,
   education, or occupation (p > 0.05). The most important factors
   associated with good attitudes were male gender (COR = 1.92; 95\% CI:
   1.92-2.84; p = 0.001) and being aged over 50 years (COR = 3.06; 95\% CI:
   1.53-6.13; p = 0.002). Conclusions: The population in Jazan had a good
   level of knowledge of vitiligo and a positive attitude toward patients
   with vitiligo. Social media is the source of information for vitiligo
   for the majority of the study population. The good attitude toward
   patients with vitiligo was more prevalent in males and older people.
   More efforts are needed to improve the knowledge of and attitudes toward
   vitiligo.},

   media (including social media) or from participating general practices.
   Baseline characteristics were compared by univariate testing. Logistic
   regression analysis was performed to study the association between
   recruitment type and multiple baseline characteristics.
   Results: The only differences between recruitment methods were in
   patient age, with those recruited through the media being significantly
   older than those recruited through general practice. The mean age
   difference was 5.0 years (95\% confidence interval: 2.2-7.9).
   Conclusion: Samples recruited through the media and through case
   identification were largely comparable. Therefore, recruitment through
   the media may be a viable alternative to recruitment through primary
   care. This may be especially relevant for research on eHealth treatment
   for conditions with which patients experience barriers when seeking
   health care. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   depression gap and find no change in the depression gap among adults
   despite large changes in women's opportunities during the same time
   period. They do, however, find an increase over time in the gender gap
   in depression among adolescents. I concur with Platt et al. that likely
   explanations for their findings involve the social environment. For
   adult women, the burden of being responsible for the majority of the
   household labor and the rise in unmarried parenting are likely
   explanations for why increased paid work opportunities have not resulted
   in a decrease in the gender gap in depression. For adolescents, the
   increase might be due to the popularity of social media rising at the
   same time expectations surrounding beauty and attractiveness heightened
   for girls and young women. Platt et al. highlight the relationship

Title = {Digital Technology Use and Mental Health Consultations: Survey of the
   Views and Experiences of Clinicians and Young People},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in
   the lives of young people and have important effects on their mental
   health.Objective: We aimed to explore 3 key areas of the intersection
   between digital technology and mental health: the views and experiences
   of young people and clinicians about digital technology and mental
   health; implementation and barriers to the UK national guidance
   recommendation-that the discussion of digital technology use should form
   a core part of mental health assessment; and how digital technology
   might be used to support existing consultations.Methods: Two
   cross-sectional web-based surveys were conducted in 2020 between June
   and December, with mental health clinicians (n=99) and young people
   (n=320). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the proportions.
   Multilinear regression was used to explore how the answers varied by
   gender, sexuality, and age. Thematic analysis was used to explore the
   contents of the extended free-text answers. Anxiety was measured using
   the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7).Results:
   Digital technology use was ubiquitous among young people, with positive
   and negative aspects acknowledged by both clinicians and young people.
   Negative experiences were common (131/284, 46.1\%) and were associated
   with increased anxiety levels among young people (GAD-7 3.29; 95\% CI
   1.97-4.61; P<.001). Although the discussion of digital technology use
   was regarded as important by clinicians and acceptable by young people,
   less than half of clinicians (42/85, 49.4\%) routinely asked about the
   use of digital technology and over a third of young people (48/121,
   39.6\%) who had received mental health care had never been asked about
   their digital technology use. The conversations were often experienced
   as unhelpful. Helpful conversations were characterized by greater depth
   and exploration of how an individual's digital technology use related to
   mental health. Despite most clinicians (59/83, 71.1\%) wanting training,
   very few (21/86, 24.4\%) reported receiving training. Clinicians were
   open to viewing mental health data from apps or social media to help
   with consultations. Although young people were generally, in theory,
   comfortable sharing such data with health professionals, when presented
   with a binary choice, most reported not wanting to share social media
   (84/117, 71.8\%) or app data (67/118, 56.8\%) during
   consultations.Conclusions: Digital technology use was common, and
   negative experiences were frequent and associated with anxiety. Over a
   third of young people were not asked about their digital technology use
   during mental health consultations, and potentially valuable information
   about relevant negative experiences on the web was not being captured
   during consultations. Clinicians would benefit from having access to
   training to support these discussions with young people. Although young
   people recognized that app data could be helpful to clinicians, they
   appeared hesitant to share their own data. This finding suggests that
   data sharing has barriers that need to be further explored.},

Title = {Acceptability of electronic healthcare predictive analytics for HIV
   prevention: a qualitative study with men who have sex with men in New
   York City},
Journal = {MHEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Large data sets, also known as ???big data???, shared in
   health information exchanges (HIEs), can be used in novel ways to
   advance health, including among communities at risk for HIV infection.
   We examined values and opinions about the acceptability of using
   electronic healthcare predictive analytics (eHPA) to promote HIV
   prevention in men who have sex with men (MSM). Our aims were twofold:
   (I) to evaluate the perspectives of MSM with diverse race/ethnicity and
   age on the acceptability of predictive analytics to determine individual
   HIV risk and (II) to determine acceptability of having targeted
   prevention messaging based upon those risk estimates sent directly to
   the consumer. Method: Two of the authors facilitated 12 focus groups
   (n=57) with adult MSM without HIV, living in NYC. Groups were divided by
   ethnicity (Black, Latino, and White) and age (under 35 and 35 and over).
   Participants were recruited through HIV prevention sites,
   community-based organizations, social media, and Internet sites that
   serve these communities. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze
   the data with Dedoose. Results: We identified six main themes related to
   acceptability: (I) reach, relevance, and potential uptake of using
   predictive analytics to establish HIV risk and deliver targeted
   prevention messaging; (II) patient-provider communication; (III) public
   health and individual rights; (IV) perceptions of intervention
   effectiveness; (V) electronic health data security; and (VI) stigma.
   Within each thematic domain, MSM discussed concerns, benefits, and
   provided recommendations for implementation. Conclusions: MSM in this
   study were supportive of the use of ???big data??? and technology to
   reach marginalized populations and improve public health, yet expressed
   concerns about the relevance, effectiveness, and security eHPA. Efforts
   to advance eHPA for HIV prevention should address these concerns,
   especially among the most-at-risk communities of color. Development of
   eHPA for HIV prevention should involve targeted messaging that addresses
   specific concerns regarding eHPA security, accuracy, and relevance.},

Title = {Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified
   Meta-Model and Associated Methodology},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans
   detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a
   specific clinical problem with a patient's expected clinical course.
   ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public
   and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP
   process has to be described by means of complex general purpose
   description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process
   model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of
   a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process
   execution due to the lack of information required by a machine.
   Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling
   language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled
   processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to
   organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the
   management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the
   graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also
   propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a
   high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the
   corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated
   with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual
   execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers
   the patient's health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that,
   thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in
   a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system
   could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based
   approaches.},

Title = {AI-Driven Clinical Decision Support: Enhancing Disease Diagnosis
   Exploiting Patients Similarity},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {6878-6888},
Abstract = {Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them
   accurately. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) facilitates the
   identification of diseases together with the most suitable treatments.
   In this paper, we propose a CDS framework able to integrate
   heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory
   test results, basic information of patients, health records and social
   media data. Using the data so collected, innovative machine learning and
   deep learning approaches can be employed. A neural network model for
   predicting patients' future health conditions is proposed. The approach
   employs word embedding to model the semantic relations of hospital
   admissions, symptoms and diagnosis, and it introduces a mechanism to
   measure the relationships of different diagnosis in terms of symptoms
   similarity to exploit for the prediction task. Several CDSs, including
   diagnostic decision support systems for inferring patient diagnosis,
   have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods typically
   focus on a single patient and apply manually or automatically
   constructed decision rules to produce a diagnosis. Even worst, they
   consider only a single medical condition, whereas it is not uncommon
   that a patient has more than one medical condition at the same time. The
   novelty of the proposed approach is the combination of supervised and
   unsupervised artificial intelligence methods allowing to combine several
   and heterogeneous data sources related to a multitude of patients and
   concerning different medical conditions. Furthermore, with respect to
   previous approaches, the diagnosis prediction problem is formulated to
   predict the exact diagnosis in terms of semantic meaning by exploiting
   Natural Language Processing concepts. Experimental results, performed on
   a real-world EHR dataset, show that the proposed approach is effective
   and accurate and provides clinically meaningful interpretations. The
   obtained outcomes are promising for future extensions of the framework
   that could be a valuable means for automatic inferring disease
   diagnosis.},

Title = {Crowdfunding and global health disparities: an exploratory conceptual
   and empirical analysis},
Journal = {GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1, 1},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Background: The use of crowdfunding platforms to cover the costs of
   healthcare is growing rapidly within low-, middle-, and high-income
   countries as a new funding modality in global health. The popularity of
   such ``medical crowdfunding{''} is fueled by health disparities and gaps
   in health coverage and social safety-net systems. Crowdfunding in its
   current manifestations can be seen as an antithesis to universal health
   coverage. But research on medical crowdfunding, particularly in global
   health contexts, has been sparse, and accessing robust data is
   difficult. To map and document how medical crowdfunding is shaped by,
   and shapes, health disparities, this article offers an exploratory
   conceptual and empirical analysis of medical crowdfunding platforms and
   practices around the world. Data are drawn from a mixed-methods analysis
   of medical crowdfunding campaigns, as well as an ongoing ethnographic
   study of crowdfunding platforms and the people who use them.
   Results: Drawing on empirical data and case examples, this article
   describes three main ways that crowdfunding is impacting health equity
   and health politics around the world: 1) as a technological determinant
   of health, wherein data ownership, algorithms and platform politics
   influence health inequities; 2) as a commercial determinant of health,
   wherein corporate influence reshapes healthcare markets and health data;
   3) and as a determinant of health politics, affecting how citizens view
   health rights and the future of health coverage.
   Conclusions: Rather than viewing crowdfunding as a social media fad or a
   purely beneficial technology, researchers and publics must recognize it
   as a complex innovation that is reshaping health systems, influencing
   health disparities, and shifting political norms, even as it introduces
   new ways of connecting and caring for those in the midst of health
   crises. More analysis, and better access to data, is needed to inform
   policy and address crowdfunding as a source of health disparities.},

Title = {The conspiracy of Covid-19 and 5G: Spatial analysis fallacies in the age
   of data democratization},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {293},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In a context of mistrust in public health institutions and practices,
   anti-COVID/vaccination protests and the storming of Congress have
   illustrated that conspiracy theories are real and immanent threat to
   health and wellbeing, democracy, and public understanding of science.
   One manifestation of this is the suggested correlation of COVID-19 with
   5G mobile technology. Throughout 2020, this alleged correlation was
   promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of
   maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation
   of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and
   they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups
   with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how
   spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by
   conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal
   association with reference to three key areas of geographical
   explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they
   exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with
   spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and
   interpreting causal effects with spatial data. For each, we consider the
   unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying
   meaningful correlation, and how their discarding facilitates
   conspiracist attribution. In doing so, we offer a basis both to
   interrogate conspiracists' uses and interpretation of data from
   elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential
   for their future misuse in an age of data democratization. Finally, this
   paper contributes to work on the basis of conspiracy theories in
   general, by asserting how - absent an appreciation of these key
   methodological principles - spatial health data may be especially prone
   to co-option by conspiracist groups.},

Title = {`Better understanding about what's going on': young Australians' use of
   digital technologies for health and fitness},
Journal = {SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Digital technologies such as websites, online discussion forums, social
   media, content-sharing platforms, mobile apps and wearable devices are
   now available as a means for young people to learn about and promote
   their health, physical fitness and wellbeing. This article provides
   findings from a qualitative interview-based study of young Australians
   (aged 16-25 years) which explored their practices and understandings
   related to digital and non-digital sources of health and fitness
   information, advice and support. The interviews were analysed using a
   feminist new materialist theoretical framework, paying attention to the
   affordances, relational connections and affective forces gathering in
   human-nonhuman assemblages to create a set of key agential capacities.
   The agential capacities generated by the participants' enactments of
   digital health included gaining a better knowledge of bodies, illness
   and healthcare and feeling more in control of health and wellbeing
   states. While the affordances of convenience, accessibility and detail
   and diversity of information offered by digital media and devices were
   valued by the participants, their accounts also highlighted the
   importance of face-to-face as well as online relationships and personal
   connections with other people for providing information and support,
   including family members and friends as well as medical professionals.
   The participants highly valued the agential capacity of digital
   technologies to generate detailed information about their bodies and
   health states and imagined new technologies that would be able to
   achieve even more detailed personalisation and customisation. However,
   they expressed little knowledge or concern about how their personal
   health data may be exploited by other actors or agencies. These insights
   go some way to recognising and acknowledging the embodied, affective and
   relational dimensions of living with, through and in the more-than-human
   worlds of digital health.},

Abstract = {Background: Early career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientist groups
   (ECPGs) can make valuable contri-butions to addressing global health
   challenges and policy development. There is limited information
   describing their contribution to this topic. This study describes
   initiatives and activities related to global health and policy
   development led by ECPGs.Methods: An online questionnaire was
   disseminated between July and October 2020 through the International
   Pharmaceutical Federation Young Pharmacists Group (FIP YPG) mailing list
   and its social media network. The survey consisted of questions about
   ECPGs' involvement in global health and policy development activities.
   In addition to groups or organisations, the FIP YPG also invited
   individual pharmacists and pharmaceutical sci-entists to explore their
   needs and views on the role of the ECPGs, and themselves as individuals
   in global health. Data were analysed descriptively.Results: Thirty
   national ECPGs across six regions of the World Health Organisation (WHO)
   participated in the survey. Most of the initiatives led by ECPGs focused
   on health and wellbeing, quality of education and part-nership. The most
   common activities were webinars, social events and partnerships with
   other organisations. In terms of global health challenges listed by the
   WHO, the most common initiatives led by ECPGs were related to medicines
   access and medicines safety. There was some involvement of early career
   pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, and ECPGs in the policy and
   regulation in their countries across various topics.Conclusion: To the
   best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first global study exploring
   initiatives conducted by ECPGs. This study informed initiatives that
   have been implemented across regions, which could be useful for other
   ECPGs to initiate in their country according to their needs and
   priorities. Fostering engagement and collaboration between ECPGs is
   encouraged to provide opportunities and share learning across ECPGs,
   which could accelerate progress towards tackling global health
   challenges.},

Title = {Knowledge, attitude, and practice among healthcare workers towards
   COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in
   patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals
   and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge,
   attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria.
   Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the
   COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed
   346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online
   (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience
   sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive
   statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure
   association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship
   between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's
   rho correlation test.
   Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8.
   The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75\%.
   Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0\%) and social media
   (35.0\%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 +/- 0.39.
   Most (92.5\%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical
   scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2\%) of
   the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon.
   About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the
   only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking
   precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2\%), washing
   of hands (96.0\%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6\%)
   against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a
   face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046)
   positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude.
   Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent
   knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards
   COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative
   attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed. We recommend
   continuous public health education of HCWs on SARS-COV-2 infection
   control and prevention.},

Title = {Analyzing Public Reactions, Perceptions, and Attitudes during the MPox
   Outbreak: Findings from Topic Modeling of Tweets},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the last decade and a half, the world has experienced outbreaks of a
   range of viruses such as COVID-19, H1N1, flu, Ebola, Zika virus, Middle
   East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), measles, and West Nile virus, just to
   name a few. During these virus outbreaks, the usage and effectiveness of
   social media platforms increased significantly, as such platforms served
   as virtual communities, enabling their users to share and exchange
   information, news, perspectives, opinions, ideas, and comments related
   to the outbreaks. Analysis of this Big Data of conversations related to
   virus outbreaks using concepts of Natural Language Processing such as
   Topic Modeling has attracted the attention of researchers from different
   disciplines such as Healthcare, Epidemiology, Data Science, Medicine,
   and Computer Science. The recent outbreak of the MPox virus has resulted
   in a tremendous increase in the usage of Twitter. Prior works in this
   area of research have primarily focused on the sentiment analysis and
   content analysis of these Tweets, and the few works that have focused on
   topic modeling have multiple limitations. This paper aims to address
   this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field.
   First, it presents the results of performing Topic Modeling on 601,432
   Tweets about the 2022 Mpox outbreak that were posted on Twitter between
   7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023. The results indicate that the conversations
   on Twitter related to Mpox during this time range may be broadly
   categorized into four distinct themes-Views and Perspectives about Mpox,
   Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, Mpox and the LGBTQIA+
   Community, and Mpox and COVID-19. Second, the paper presents the
   findings from the analysis of these Tweets. The results show that the
   theme that was most popular on Twitter (in terms of the number of Tweets
   posted) during this time range was Views and Perspectives about Mpox.
   This was followed by the theme of Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, which
   was followed by the themes of Mpox and COVID-19 and Updates on Cases and
   Investigations about Mpox, respectively. Finally, a comparison with
   related studies in this area of research is also presented to highlight
   the novelty and significance of this research work.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the COVID-19 phobia level in
   healthcare workers. The socio-demographic characteristics form and the
   Coronavirus 19 Phobia (CP19-S) Scale were used as data collection tools.
   The surveys were shared online on social media. 467 healthcare workers
   who agreed to participate in the study were reached. Employees who got
   55.30 +/- 14.64 points from the scale total scores and university
   graduates were found to have an average of 55.51 +/- 14.11, and their
   families averaged 57.84 +/- 15.05. As a result, it was determined that
   the COVID-19 phobia levels of healthcare workers were affected by
   situations such as gender, education level and elderly family members.
   In this case, the importance of determining the working areas of
   healthcare professionals according to their phobia levels is emphasized,
   as it will affect the quality of care given to patients during the
   pandemic process.},

Title = {Passive Sensing of Preteens' Smartphone Use: An Adolescent Brain
   Cognitive Development (ABCD) Cohort Substudy},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Background: Concerns abound regarding childhood smartphone use, but
   studies to date have largely relied on self-reported screen use.
   Self-reporting of screen use is known to be misreported by pediatric
   samples and their parents, limiting the accurate determination of the
   impact of screen use on social, emotional, and cognitive development.
   Thus, a more passive, objective measurement of smartphone screen use
   among children is needed.
   Objective: This study aims to passively sense smartphone screen use by
   time and types of apps used in a pilot sample of children and to assess
   the feasibility of passive sensing in a larger longitudinal sample.
   Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study used
   passive, objective phone app methods for assessing smartphone screen use
   over 4 weeks in 2019-2020 in a subsample of 67 participants (aged 11-12
   years; 31/67, 46\% female; 23/67, 34\% White). Children and their
   parents both reported average smartphone screen use before and after the
   study period, and they completed a questionnaire regarding the
   acceptability of the study protocol. Descriptive statistics for
   smartphone screen use, app use, and protocol feasibility and
   acceptability were reviewed. Analyses of variance were run to assess
   differences in categorical app use by demographics. Self-report and
   parent report were correlated with passive sensing data.
   Results: Self-report of smartphone screen use was partly consistent with
   objective measurement (r=0.49), although objective data indicated that
   children used their phones more than they reported. Passive sensing
   revealed the most common types of apps used were for streaming (mean 1
   hour 57 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 32 minutes), communication (mean 48
   minutes per day, SD 1 hour 17 minutes), gaming (mean 41 minutes per day,
   SD 41 minutes), and social media (mean 36 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 7
   minutes). Passive sensing of smartphone screen use was generally
   acceptable to children (43/62, 69\%) and parents (53/62, 85\%).
   Conclusions: The results of passive, objective sensing suggest that
   children use their phones more than they self-report. Therefore, use of
   more robust methods for objective data collection is necessary and
   feasible in pediatric samples. These data may then more accurately
   reflect the impact of smartphone screen use on behavioral and emotional
   functioning. Accordingly, the ABCD study is implementing a passive
   sensing protocol in the full ABCD cohort. Taken together, passive
   assessment with a phone app provided objective, low-burden, novel,
   informative data about preteen smartphone screen use.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose Virus mitigation strategies such as adhering to
   stay-at-home orders, practicing social distancing, and engaging in
   personal protective behaviors are central to slowing the spread of
   COVID-19. This population-based cohort study sought to identify
   sociodemographic characteristics and Health Belief Model factors that
   are associated with nonadherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies with
   the goal of informing public health messaging campaigns.
   Methods An online population-based survey was distributed via social
   media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020.
   Results Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57\% female; 40\%
   racial/ethnic minorities). Univariate analyses revealed that men,
   younger aged (18-30 years) and unmarried adults, and noncollege educated
   individuals had lower levels of perceived threat, control, and knowledge
   about COVID-19 (p <= .001). Multivariable linear regression models
   further revealed that male gender was significantly associated with
   reporting lower levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p
   < .001), and that higher levels of perceived threat, perceived control,
   and knowledge about how to keep oneself and others safe from COVID-19
   were significantly associated with reporting higher levels of adherence
   to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .01).
   Conclusions Findings suggest that public health appeals that target men,
   emphasize individual risk, and provide clear, consistent guidance on
   what individuals can do to decrease their risk for COVID-19 may be
   effective in motivating increased mitigation adherence.},

Abstract = {The cardio-renal syndrome (CRS) can be generally defined as a
   pathophysiologic disorder includes a broad spectrum of diseases in which
   heart and kidney are both involved, the CRS classification essentially
   recognizes two main groups, cardio-renal and Reno-cardiac syndromes, on
   the basis of ``premium moves{''} of disease (cardiac or renal); both
   cardio-renal and Reno-cardiac syndromes are then divided into acute and
   chronic, according to the disease's onset, Five subtypes of the
   syndromes were identified, abrupt worsening of cardiac function that
   lead to acute kidney injury called Acute Cardio-renal Syndrome or Type 1
   CRS, this appears to be a syndrome of worsening renal function that
   frequently complicates hospitalized patients with acute heart failure
   and acute coronary syndrome. When Chronic abnormalities in cardiac
   function (e.g. chronic congestive heart failure) cause progressive and
   potentially permanent chronic kidney disease this condition called
   chronic cardio-renal syndrome or Type 2 CRS, CKD has been observed in
   45-63\% of CHF patients24, 25, 26, {[}10]. The number of participants in
   the questionnaire is 100 and the questionnaire was distributed in two
   ways. In the first way, the questionnaire was published on social media
   and the number of participants was 79 and the number of pharmacists
   participating in the electronic questionnaire was 51 and the number of
   participating physicians was 28. In the second way, the questionnaire
   was distributed to a group of private pharmacies in Baghdad, which
   numbered 21 and purpose of the questionnaire was to find out if the
   participants had any information about Cardio-renal Syndrome. Heart and
   kidney interactions are complex and the subject of immense clinical and
   scientific interest and debate. In this article, we argue that without
   consensus on definitions and classification, clinicians will not be able
   to precisely phenotype the various forms of cardio-renal syndrome. Such
   phenotyping, in turn, forms the basis for in vitro and animal studies,
   as well as small translational studies in patients. Through the ADQI
   consensus on CRS, other processes will now be facilitated, including a
   better or clearer understanding of the epidemiology of these conditions,
   opportunities for early diagnosis through biomarkers, the development of
   preventive strategies and application of evidence-based management
   strategies},

Title = {Exploring the Association Between the ``Big Five{''} Personality Traits
   and Fatal Opioid Overdose: County-Level Empirical Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Opioid-related deaths constitute a problem of pandemic
   proportions in the United States, with no clear solution in sight.
   Although addressing addiction-the heart of this problem-ought to remain
   a priority for health practitioners, examining the community-level
   psychological factors with a known impact on health behaviors may
   provide valuable insights for attenuating this health crisis by curbing
   risky behaviors before they evolve into addiction.
   Objective: The goal of this study is twofold: to demonstrate the
   relationship between community-level psychological traits and fatal
   opioid overdose both theoretically and empirically, and to provide a
   blueprint for using social media data to glean these psychological
   factors in a real-time, reliable, and scalable manner.
   Methods: We collected annual panel data from Twitter for 2891 counties
   in the United States between 2014-2016 and used a novel data mining
   technique to obtain average county-level ``Big Five{''} psychological
   trait scores. We then performed interval regression, using a control
   function to alleviate omitted variable bias, to empirically test the
   relationship between county-level psychological traits and the
   prevalence of fatal opioid overdoses in each county.
   Results: After controlling for a wide range of community-level
   biopsychosocial factors related to health outcomes, we found that three
   of the operationalizations of the five psychological traits examined at
   the community level in the study were significantly associated with
   fatal opioid overdoses: extraversion (beta=.308, P<.001), neuroticism
   (beta=.248, P<.001), and conscientiousness (beta=.229, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Analyzing the psychological characteristics of a community
   can be a valuable tool in the local, state, and national fight against
   the opioid pandemic. Health providers and community health organizations
   can benefit from this research by evaluating the psychological profile
   of the communities they serve and assessing the projected risk of fatal
   opioid overdose based on the relationships our study predict when making
   decisions for the allocation of overdose-reversal medication and other
   vital resources.},

   primary anorectal lesions are likely to be missed. If men could detect
   anorectal lesions in the primary stage by regular anal self-examination
   (ASE), transmission could be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.
   We aimed to explore the attitudes of MSM on performing ASE to detect
   primary anorectal syphilis. An online anonymous cross-sectional survey
   among MSM over 18 years of age living in Australia, was conducted
   between July and November 2020 and recruitment was from a sexual health
   clinic and social media. A total of 568 MSM completed the survey (median
   age: 34 {[}IQR 27-45]): 32\% (183) had previously performed ASE. Among
   66\% (374) who had never performed ASE, 68\% (250) would consider
   performing ASE in the future with a preferred median frequency of 2
   times per 4 weeks (IQR 1-4), whilst men who were already performing ASE
   were performing it at median 1 per 4 weeks (IQR 0.2-3). Almost
   two-thirds of MSM who had never performed ASE were willing to adopt ASE
   practice in the future. Studies are required to determine the
   effectiveness of ASE for syphilis detection.},

Title = {Trends in generalised anxiety disorders and symptoms in primary care: UK
   population-based cohort study},

Abstract = {Background
   Generalised anxiety disorder and symptoms are associated with poor
   physical, emotional and social functioning and frequent primary and
   acute care visits. We investigated recent temporal trends in anxiety and
   related mental illness in UK general practice.
   Aims
   The aims of this analysis are to examine temporal changes in recording
   of generalised anxiety in primary care and initial pharmacologic
   treatments.
   Method
   Annual incidence rates of generalised anxiety diagnoses and symptoms
   were calculated from 795 UK general practices contributing to The Health
   Improvement Network (THIN) database between 1998 and 2018. Poisson mixed
   regression was used to account for age, gender and general practitioner
   practice. Subsequent pharmacologic treatment was examined.
   Results
   Generalised anxiety recording rates increased in both genders aged 18-24
   between 2014 and 2018. For women, the increase was from 17.06 to
   23.33/1000 person years at risk (PYAR); for men, 8.59 to 11.65/1000
   PYAR. Increases persisted for a composite of anxiety and depression
   (49.74 to 57.81/1000 PYAR for women; 25.41 to 31.45/1000 PYAR for men).
   Smaller increases in anxiety were seen in both genders age 25-34 and
   35-44. Anxiety rates among older patients remained stable, although a
   composite of anxiety and depression decreased for older women. About
   half of drug-naive patients were prescribed anxiety drugs within 1 year
   following diagnosis. The most common choice was a selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor. Benzodiazepine prescription rate has fallen
   steadily.
   Conclusions
   We observed a substantial increase in general practitioner consulting
   for generalised anxiety and depression recently, concentrated within
   younger people and in particular women.},

Title = {Frequent discussion of insomnia and weight gain with glucocorticoid
   therapy: an analysis of Twitter posts},
Journal = {NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {In recent years, social media websites have been suggested as a novel,
   vast source of data which may be useful for deriving drug safety
   information. Despite this, there are few published reports of drug
   safety profiles derived in this way. The aims of this study were to
   detect and quantify glucocorticoid-related adverse events using a
   computerised system for automated detection of suspected adverse drug
   reactions (ADR) from narrative text in Twitter, and to compare the
   frequency of specific ADR mentions within Twitter to the frequency and
   patterns of spontaneous ADR reporting to a national drug regulatory
   body. Of 159,297 tweets mentioning either prednisolone or prednisone
   between 1st October 2012 and 30th June 2015, 20,206 tweets were deemed
   to contain information resembling an ADR. The top AE MedDRA (R)
   Preferred Terms were `insomnia' and `weight increased', both recognised
   non-serious but common side effects. These were proportionally
   over-reported in Twitter when compared to spontaneous reports in the UK
   regulator's ADR reporting scheme. Serious glucocorticoid related AEs
   were reported less frequently. Pharmacovigilance using Twitter data has
   the potential to be a valuable, supplementary source of drug safety
   information. In particular, it can illustrate which drug side effects
   patients discuss most commonly, potentially because of important impacts
   on quality of life. This information could help clinicians to inform
   patients about frequent and relevant non-serious side effects as well as
   more serious side effects.},

Title = {``This is some mess right here{''}: Exploring interactions between Black

Journal = {CANCER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-81},
Month = {2021 JAN 1},
Abstract = {Background Few studies have explored how the intersection of race and
   sexual identity contribute to breast cancer disparities for Black sexual
   minority women (SMW). Issues within patient-provider relationships,
   including bias, contribute to health disparities for minority groups.
   The authors used constructs from self-determination theory (SDT) to
   explore the nature of health care provider interactions in breast cancer
   screening and care among Black SMW. Methods Participants were sampled
   nationally through social media, targeted emails, and referrals.
   Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 Black cisgender
   SMW, ages 38 to 64 years, who had a breast cancer diagnosis or recent
   abnormal mammogram. Interviews were conducted face-to-face or online,
   audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Two analysts coded the
   interviews. Codes were analyzed across interviews to identify themes
   salient to SDT. Results Themes aligned with the SDT constructs of
   relatedness and autonomy. Some participants discussed feeling most
   understood by Black and/or female providers who shared at least 1 of
   their identities. Feeling understood through shared identity contributed
   to participants feeling seen and heard by their providers. Participants
   who discussed negative experiences with providers believed that the
   provider made negative assumptions about them based on their race and/or
   sexual orientation. Conclusions When interacting with health care
   providers for breast cancer screening and care, Black SMW face specific
   challenges related to their multiply marginalized social position.
   Reducing health care provider bias toward Black SMW may improve
   patients' desires to continue in care. Providing equitable care while
   acknowledging and respecting women with multiply marginalized identities
   may improve the nature of these interactions.},

Title = {Health Disparities in Staphylococcus aureus Transmission and Carriage in
   a Border Region of the United States Based on Cultural Differences in
   Social Relationships: Protocol for a Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Health care-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are
   declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated
   infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health
   mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term
   goal is to use risk-based information from empirical
   socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to
   inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the
   community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural
   affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage
   and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors.
   Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates
   and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with
   disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups
   and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2)
   evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of
   health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission
   of S aureus.
   Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health
   sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer
   transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community
   and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if
   strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of
   community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from
   participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission
   within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social
   determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history,
   etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to
   determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S
   aureus transmission.
   Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of
   survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on
   the original funded design for this project (\#NIH U54MD012388). That
   design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337
   individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data
   assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined
   data monitoring procedures.
   Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific
   prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will
   also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are
   concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis
   of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission
   pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our
   understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across
   clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged
   nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for
   completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of
   S aureus carriage and transmission.},

Abstract = {Background. Major depression is associated with significant disability,
   morbidity, and mortality. The current study estimated trends in the
   prevalence of major depression in the US population from 2005 to 2015
   overall and by demographic subgroups.
   Methods. Data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
   (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of US persons ages 12 and over
   (total analytic sample N = 607 520). Past-year depression prevalence was
   examined annually among respondents from 2005 to 2015. Time trends in
   depression prevalence stratified by survey year were tested using
   logistic regression. Data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender,
   race/ethnicity, income, and education.
   Results. Depression prevalence increased significantly in the USA from
   2005 to 2015, before and after controlling for demographics. Increases
   in depression were significant for the youngest and oldest age groups,
   men, and women, Non-Hispanic White persons, the lowest income group, and
   the highest education and income groups. A significant year x
   demographic interaction was found for age. The rate of increase in
   depression was significantly more rapid among youth relative to all
   older age groups.
   Conclusions. The prevalence of depression increased significantly in the
   USA from 2005 to 2015. The rate of increase in depression among youth
   was significantly more rapid relative to older groups. Further research
   into understanding the macro level, micro level, and individual factors
   that are contributing to the increase in depression, including factors
   specific to demographic subgroups, would help to direct public health
   prevention and intervention efforts.},

Month = {2021 FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined prevalence and correlates of probable
   depression and suicidal ideation among Hong Kong Chinese residents
   amidst the anti-extradition bill protests.
   Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative
   sample of Hong Kong residents aged 15 years or older during the first
   three weeks of July, 2019. Respondents reported current depressive
   symptoms and suicidal ideation, participation in protest activities,
   attitudes and perceived stress, disruptions to daily routines, and
   demographics.
   Results: Among 1112 respondents, 25.7\% reported probable depression,
   and 9.1\% reported suicidal ideation. Multivariable logistic regression
   showed that persons with higher odds of probable depression had primary
   education and high disruptions to regular routines of eating, sleep,
   socializing, and leisure activities. Persons who were at higher odds of
   suicidal ideation had lower household income, used social media to
   engage in the protests, and had medium or high disruptions to regular
   eating and sleep.
   Conclusions: During the anti-extradition bill protests, the prevalence
   of probable depression and suicidal ideation were substantially higher
   than would be expected and higher than during the Umbrella Movement of
   2014. Psychiatric morbidity may be a consequence of massive social
   movements, particularly among persons with limited protective resources
   whose daily life is disrupted by these events. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Across various domains, such as health and social care, law, news, and
   social media, there are increasing quantities of unstructured texts
   being produced. These potential data sources often contain rich
   information that could be used for domain-specific and research
   purposes. However, the unstructured nature of free-text data poses a
   significant challenge for its utilisation due to the necessity of
   substantial manual intervention from domain-experts to label embedded
   information. Annotation tools can assist with this process by providing
   functionality that enables the accurate capture and transformation of
   unstructured texts into structured annotations, which can be used
   individually, or as part of larger Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   pipelines. We present Markup (https:// www.getmarkup.com/) an
   open-source, web-based annotation tool that is undergoing continued
   development for use across all domains. Markup incorporates NLP and
   Active Learning (AL) technologies to enable rapid and accurate
   annotation using custom user configurations, predictive annotation
   suggestions, and automated mapping suggestions to both domain-specific
   ontologies, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and
   custom, user-defined ontologies. We demonstrate a real-world use case of
   how Markup has been used in a healthcare setting to annotate structured
   information from unstructured clinic letters, where captured annotations
   were used to build and test NLP applications.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Purpose: Access to COVID-19 testing remained a salient issue during the
   early months of the pandemic, therefore this study aimed to identify 1)
   regional and 2) socioeconomic predictors of perceived ability to access
   Coronavirus testing. Methods: An online survey using social media-based
   advertising was conducted among U.S. adults in April 2020. Participants
   were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test,
   along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information.
   Results: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access
   to COVID-19 testing. In adjusted analyses, we found higher income and
   possession of health insurance to be associated with perceived ability
   to access Coronavirus testing. Geographically, perceived access was
   highest (68\%) in East South Central division and lowest (39\%) in West
   North Central. Disparities in health insurance coverage did not directly
   correspond to disparities in perceived access to COVID-19 testing.
   Conclusions: Sex, geographic location, income, and insurance status were
   associated with perceived access to COVID-19 testing; interventions
   aimed at improving either access or awareness of measures taken to
   improve access are warranted. These findings from the pandemic's early
   months shed light on the importance of disaggregating perceived and true
   access to screening during such crises.

Abstract = {We observed an increase in notifications of puerperal group A
   Streptococcus (GAS) infections in July and August 2018 throughout the
   Netherlands without evidence for common sources. General practitioners
   reported a simultaneous increase in impetigo. We hypothesised that the
   outbreak of puerperal GAS infections resulted from increased exposure
   via impetigo in the community.
   We conducted a case-control study to assess peripartum exposure to
   possible, non-invasive GAS infections using an online questionnaire.
   Confirmed cases were recruited through public health services while
   probable cases and controls were recruited through social media. We
   calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) with
   logistic regression analysis.
   We enrolled 22 confirmed and 23 probable cases, and 2,400 controls.
   Contact with persons with impetigo were reported by 8\% of cases and 2\%
   of controls (OR: 3.26, 95\% CI: 0.98-10.88) and contact with possible
   GAS infections (impetigo, pharyngitis or scarlet fever) by 28\% and 9\%,
   respectively (OR: 4.12, 95\% CI: 1.95-8.68). In multivariable analysis,
   contact with possible GAS infections remained an independent risk factor
   (a0R: 4.28, 95\% CI: 2.02-9.09).
   We found an increased risk of puerperal fever after community contact
   with possible non-invasive GAS infections. Further study of this
   association is warranted.},

Abstract = {Background: Patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery often search the
   internet for information regarding the procedure. One popular source,
   Google, compiles frequently asked questions and links to websites that
   may provide answers. This study provides an analysis of the most
   frequently searched questions associated with rotator cuff surgery. We
   hypothesize that there will be distinct search patterns associated with
   online queries about rotator cuff surgery that could provide unique
   insights into patient concerns. Methods: A set of search terms were
   entered into Google Web Search using a clean-install Google Chrome
   browser. Frequently associated questions and their webpages were
   extracted to a database via a data mining extension. Questions were
   categorized by topics relevant for rotator cuff arthroscopy. Websites
   were categorized by source and scored for quality using the JAMA
   Benchmark Criteria. Pearson's x(2) tests were used to analyze nominal
   data. Student t tests were performed to compare JAMA Benchmark
   Scores.Results: Of the 595 questions generated from the initial search,
   372 unique questions associated with 293 websites were extracted and
   categorized. The most popular question topics were
   activities/restrictions (20.7\%), pain (18.8\%), and
   indications/management (13.2\%). The 2 most common websites searched
   were academic (35.2\%) and medical practice (27.4\%). Commercial
   websites were significantly more likely to be associated with questions
   about cost (57.1\% of all cost questions, P = .01), anatomy/function
   (62.5\%, P = .001), and evaluation of surgery (47.6\%, P < .001).
   Academic websites were more likely to be associated with questions about
   technical details of surgery (58.1\%, P < .001). Medical practice and
   social media websites were more likely associated with
   activities/restrictions (48.1\%, P < .001, and 15.6\%, P < .001,
   respectively). Government websites were more likely associated with
   timeline of recovery (12.8\%, P = .01). On a scale of 0-4, commercial
   and academic websites had the highest JAMA scores (3.06 and 2.39,
   respectively). Conclusion: Patients seeking information regarding
   rotator cuff repair primarily use the Google search engine to ask
   questions regarding postoperative activity and restrictions, followed by
   pain, indications, and management. Academic websites, which were
   associated with technical details of surgery, and medical practice
   websites, which were associated with activities/restrictions, were the 2
   most commonly searched resources. These results emphasize the need for
   orthopedic surgeons to provide detailed and informative instructions to
   patients undergoing rotator cuff repair, especially in the

Abstract = {Introduction: This study investigated the psychometric properties of the
   Spanish version of the body vigilance scale (BVS). The recruitment has
   been performed through an online survey launched through common social
   media.
   Material and Methods: All subjects were older than 18 years and affected
   by panic disorder as a self-reported diagnosis. 367 individuals were
   rated for the validation analysis. BVS has been translated into Spanish
   and validated through confirmatory factor analysis. Participants have
   been also scored with the self-report panic disorder severity scale
   (PDSS-SR). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test was adequate (KMO=0.0887) and
   sphericity tested significantly (p<0.001). The confirmatory analysis
   confirmed that the scale is one-dimensional.
   Results: The model adjustment was good, according to all fit indices.
   Cronbach's alpha also confirmed an excellent internal consistency
   (alpha=0.985). Scores between the two scales (BVS and PDSS-SR) have
   shown a good convergence (r=0.898; p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The Spanish version of the BVS has shown good psychometric
   properties and adequately reproduce the one-dimensional model of the
   original English version.},

Title = {Willingness of children and adolescents to have a COVID-19 vaccination:
   Results of a large whole schools survey in England},
Journal = {ECLINICALMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {2021 OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccine hesitancy has affected COVID-19 adult vaccination
   programs in many countries. Data on hesitancy amongst child and
   adolescent populations is largely confined to parent opinion. We
   investigated the characteristics of vaccine hesitant children and
   adolescents using results from a large, school-based selfreport survey
   of the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccination in students aged 9 -18
   years in England. Methods: Data from the OxWell Student Survey on mental
   health, life experiences and behaviours were used, collected from four
   counties across England. Local authority partners recruited schools. The
   vaccine hesitancy question gave six response options and were clustered
   to inform delivery: eager and willing were categorised as vaccination
   `opt-in', don't know and not bothered categorised as `undecided', and
   unwilling and antivaccination categorised as `opt-out'. We conducted a
   multinomial regression to determine associations between vaccine
   hesitancy and sociodemographic, health behaviour and social connection
   variables. Findings: 27,910 students from 180 schools answered the
   vaccine hesitancy question between 14th May and 21st July 2021, of whom
   13984 (50.1\%) would opt-in to take a vaccination, 10322 (37.0\%) were
   undecided, and 3604 (12.9\%) would opt-out. A lower percentage of
   younger students reported that they would opt-in to vaccination, for
   example, 35.7\% of 9-year-olds and 51.3\% of 13-year-olds compared to
   77.8\% of 17-year-olds would opt-in to take a vaccination. Students who
   were `opt-out' or `undecided' (a combined `vaccine hesitant' group) were
   more likely to come from deprived socioeconomic contexts with higher
   rates of home rental versus home ownership and their school locations
   were more likely to be in areas of greater deprivation. They were more
   likely to smoke or vape, spend longer on social media, feel that they
   did not belong in their school community but had lower levels of anxiety
   and depression. The vaccine hesitant students- the undecided and opt-out
   groups- were similar in profile, although the opt-out students had
   higher reported confirmed or probable previous COVID-19 infection than
   the opt-in group, whereas those undecided, did not. Interpretation: If
   government vaccination strategies move towards vaccinating younger
   school-aged students, efforts to increase vaccination uptake may be
   necessary. Compared with students who would opt-in, those who were
   vaccine hesitant had greater indicators of social deprivation and felt a
   lack of community cohesion by not feeling a sense of belonging at their
   school. There were indications that those students who would opt-out had
   higher levels of marginalisation and mistrust. If programmes are rolled
   out, focus on hesitant younger students will be important, targeting
   more marginalised and deprived young people with information from
   trusted sources utilising social media; improving access to vaccination
   centres with provision both in and outside school; and addressing fears
   and worries about the effects of the vaccine. The main limitation of
   this study is that the participant group may not be wholly
   representative of England or the UK, which may bias population-level
   estimates of willingness to be vaccinated. Funding: The Westminster
   Foundation, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Applied

Title = {Mathematical modelling and analysis of alcohol-methamphetamine co-abuse
   in the Western Cape Province of South Africa},
Journal = {COGENT MATHEMATICS \& STATISTICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Substance/drug abuse poses a significant threat to the health and
   socio-economic fabric of individuals and nations. The combined abuse of
   alcohol and the highly addictive methamphetamine has worsened the drug
   epidemic in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape province. In
   this paper, a mathematical model is formulated to model the dynamics of
   alcohol and methamphetamine co-abuse. We prove that the equilibria of
   the submodels are locally and globally asymptotically stable when the
   sub-model threshold parameters are less than unity. The basic
   reproduction number due to co-abuse is shown to be the maximum of the
   two sub-model reproduction numbers. Sensitivity analysis reveals that
   the most sensitive parameters in the co-abuse epidemic are the alcohol
   and methamphetamine recruitment rates B-1 and B-2 respectively. The
   prevalence curve is indicative of a persistent drug problem in the
   region. Hence, the need to promote social programs that raise awareness
   of the dangers posed by multiple substance abuse, through educational
   campaigns in learning institutions, social media and health
   institutions. Transmission control must focus on enhancing the quitting
   process while promoting support services to drug users during and after
   treatment to minimize cases of relapse.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and
   high-impact chronic pain (HICP) in a sample of the general adult
   population in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional online survey (N=24,265). Forty data
   collectors from 5 regions of Saudi Arabia approached people to complete
   the questionnaires through different social media applications, using a
   validated survey in Arabic language.
   Results: Chronic pain and HICP prevalences in the Saudi adult population
   were found to be 46.4\% (CP) and 4\% (HICP), with a higher prevalence
   among women and elderly. Chronic back pain was the most reported pain
   location. Half of the respondents reported dissatisfaction with pain
   services. Greater prevalence of HICP was found among women, elderly,
   unemployed, and those with low-income status. Patients with HICP were
   more likely to have more healthcare utilization and have more negative
   impacts on their physical and psychological wellbeing.
   Conclusion: Chronic pain and HICP are common in Saudi Arabia, especially
   among females and elderly, suggesting a public health problem. This
   calls for collaborative efforts at various levels of the social
   hierarchy to ensure the provision of effective management of CP in Saudi
   Arabia.},

   Abdominal Pain Disorders and Functional Constipation among Children of
   the Western Region of Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {GLOBAL PEDIATRIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by absence of
   anatomical and biochemical alterations, and are diagnosed and classified
   based on symptomatology. We aim to explore the prevalence of functional
   abdominal pain disorders and Functional constipation using Rome IV
   criteria. An online questionnaire was distributed randomly via social
   media targeting the general population of the western region of Saudi
   Arabia. Parents who have at least 1 child in the age group 3 to 18 years
   were included. Children with mental disabilities, or any organic
   gastrointestinal disorder were excluded. Five hundred thirty-two
   responded and 215 were excluded. The overall prevalence of functional
   abdominal pain disorders was 3.1\%. The prevalence of functional
   constipation was 4.7\%. Conclusions: Rome IV criteria seems to give a
   lower functional abdominal pain prevalence than Rome III, online
   learning did not seem to affect the prevalence of both disorders, but a
   family stressor seems to increase functional constipation prevalence.},

Title = {Quinary prevention in diabetes care: Need for multidisciplinary approach},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {2021 JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Problem considered: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global pandemic
   with increasing prevalence worldwide. Hearsay, or reported speech, is an
   important contributor to diabetes care related behavior and may
   influence the outcomes of diabetes treatment. An emerging concept in
   preventive medicine is Quinary prevention which aims at preventing
   health-related hearsay or misinformation.
   Methods: A group of international clinical experts comprising
   endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists and community medicine
   specialists gathered in India and discussed ways to restrain the menace
   of de-hearsay in diabetes care.
   Results: Based on the discussion, the expert panel endorsed the term
   ``quinary prevention{''} which is a mode of preventing the spread of
   false health information. The panel also outlined several means through
   which the physician community can prevent the spread of misinformation.
   Conclusions: Considering the increasing use of technology by the general
   population, treating health care pro-fessionals should keep updating
   with the newer research evidences in their fields and disseminate
   authentic knowledge on diabetes care on social media, print media as
   well as other mass media, thereby diabetes pro-moting self-management,
   as well as public health.},

Title = {Malodors as environmental injustice: health symptoms in the aftermath of
   a hydrogen sulfide emergency in Carson, California, USA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 30},
Abstract = {In October 2021, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a toxic odorous gas, was
   measured in Carson, California at concentrations reaching 7000 parts per
   billion (ppb), exceeding California's 30 ppb acute air quality standard.
   Thousands of residents complained of malodors and headaches. We
   responded to community concerns by launching a rapid survey assessing
   symptoms. We recruited participants through door-to-door outreach,
   community events, and social media. During the emergency's first week,
   75\% of the 108 total respondents experienced headaches, 72\%
   experienced dizziness, and 63\% experienced difficulty sleeping. About
   60\% of respondents (n = 63, no response = 7) noted the odor worsening
   their mental health. When adjusting for age, sex, and smoking,
   participants <2 km from the highest H2S concentrations reported higher
   prevalence of agitation (PD = 0.23, 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.42) and headaches
   (PR = 0.14, 95\% CI: -0.04, 1.31) compared to participants farther away.
   Malodors are underprioritized in environmental justice communities,
   despite H2S's effects on mental and physical health.},

Title = {Workplace contact patterns in England during the COVID-19 pandemic:
   Analysis of the Virus Watch prospective cohort study},
Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {2022 MAY},
Abstract = {Background Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2
   exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is
   lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and
   features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19
   pandemic in England. Methods Data were obtained from electronic contact
   diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by
   employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616).
   We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time
   for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time
   spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face
   coverings. Findings Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied
   across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space
   sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78\% {[}95\% CI:
   75-81\%]) and education workers (64\% {[}59\%-69\%]), who also had the
   highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36\%
   {[}32\%-40\%] and 38\% {[}33\%-43\%] respectively). Education workers
   also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51\%
   {[}44\%-57\%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across
   all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased
   and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent
   restrictions. Interpretation Major variations in workplace contact
   patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk.
   Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform
   interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory
   epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced
   face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community
   transmission and emergence of variants. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Identifying target areas for risk-based surveillance and control of

   live-trade cattle movements in Uganda},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary
   Animal Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would
   otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and
   infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to
   describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda
   and unravel critical network features that identify districts or
   sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We
   constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district
   cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of
   the movement ('slaughter' vs. `live trade') was used to subset the
   network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that
   cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in
   Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the
   network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified
   throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of
   the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district
   hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and
   west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the
   contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were
   observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly
   slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor.
   Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value
   chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks
   for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like
   Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of
   risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource
   allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement
   and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across
   animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic
   impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {Cities play an important role in fostering and amplifying the
   transmission of airborne diseases (e.g., influenza) because of dense
   human contacts. Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city,
   how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective
   vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease
   spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit
   among different groups of people over geographical locations through
   human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued
   that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social
   interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective
   vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the
   effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are
   characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and
   movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of
   geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the
   urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate
   influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to
   1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing
   effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of
   different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social
   patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of
   vaccination strategies based on geo-social interaction patterns in
   containing the epidemic outbreak at the source. This research can
   provide evidence to inform public health approaches to determine
   effective scales in the design of disease control strategies.},

Abstract = {Objective: Maintaining clinical guideline currency has been one
   challenge to traditional guideline development. This paper describes the
   methods used to maintain a large national guideline for stroke
   management. Study design and setting: The Australian Stroke Clinical
   Guidelines are developed to meet Australian National Health and Medical
   Research Council (NHMRC) standards. Monthly surveillance is conducted
   for new systematic reviews and randomised controlled studies. Included
   studies undergo data extraction followed by preparation of updated
   evidence-to-decision frameworks which are used to inform updates, or
   development of new recommendations. Small writing groups made up of
   clinical experts and those with lived experience review and agree on
   changes, which are finally reviewed by a multidisciplinary Guidelines
   Steering Group. Draft changes are developed and published using the
   online MAGICapp platform, with dissemination and promotion via
   traditional methods as well as social media. Results: Each month
   approximately 350 abstracts are considered, covering 96 clinical topics
   and taking on average 16 h to review. There have been four major
   guideline updates covering 34 new and updated recommendations.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to use `living' methods to maintain the
   Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management. Further work is
   now needed to understand the impact of living guidelines. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Objective: Data extraction is a prerequisite for analyzing, summarizing,
   and interpreting evidence in systematic reviews. Yet guidance is
   limited, and little is known about current approaches. We surveyed
   systematic reviewers on their current approaches to data extraction,
   opinions on methods, and research needs.Study Design and Setting: We
   developed a 29-question online survey and distributed it through
   relevant organizations, social media, and personal networks in 2022.
   Closed questions were evaluated using descriptive statistics, and open
   questions were analyzed using con-tent analysis.Results: 162 reviewers
   participated. Use of adapted (65\%) or newly developed extraction forms
   (62\%) was common. Generic forms were rarely used (14\%). Spreadsheet
   software was the most popular extraction tool (83\%). Piloting was
   reported by 74\% of respondents and included a variety of approaches.
   Independent and duplicate extraction was considered the most appropriate
   approach to data collection (64\%). About half of respondents agreed
   that blank forms and/or raw data should be published. Suggested research
   gaps were the effects of different methods on error rates (60\%) and the
   use of data extraction support tools (46\%).Conclusion: Systematic
   reviewers used varying approaches to pilot data extraction. Methods to
   reduce errors and use of support tools such as (semi-)automation tools
   are top research gaps.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many older individuals with dementia (OIWD) show care-resistant behavior
   for oral care. Providing care despite resistance is considered to be
   involuntary care. Although involuntary care should be minimized, in some
   OIWD it may be necessary to avoid health risks. This study aims to
   assess the attitudes of healthcare providers with regard to involuntary
   oral care provision for OIWD who show care-resistant behavior. An online
   questionnaire consisting of general questions and case specific
   questions was administered via social media and networking to
   individuals involved in the oral care of OIWD. A total of 309
   participants were included in this study. The outcomes of the
   questionnaires were categorized per case. In all cases, a discrepancy
   was seen between the assessment of oral health problems as potentially
   harmful (range: 73.1-93.5\%) and the willingness to provide involuntary
   care (range: 31.1-63.4\%). Hence, many healthcare providers are aware of
   the subsequent potential health risks related to not providing care, but
   are still reluctant to provide involuntary oral care. Therefore, many
   OIWD who show care-resistant behavior potentially do not receive the
   necessary oral care they require.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To address the gap in knowledge by providing data and
   analyses of the status of awareness among Saudi adults.
   Methods: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was carried out
   in Saudi Arabia from August 2018 to August 2019 through social media
   platforms using SurveyMonkey. The domains of the questionnaire included
   demographic information, knowledge of types and symptoms of head and
   neck cancers (HNCs), and the relation of HNCs to human papillomavirus
   (HPV) and its vaccine.
   Results: A total of 3171 respondents completed the questionnaire. The
   analysis revealed that many of the study respondents (49.3\%) were not
   knowledgeable about HNCs. Almost two-thirds (61.2\%) of the study
   population incorrectly believed that brain cancer was included in HNCs.
   Over half (57.8\%) did not recognize headaches as a symptom. In terms of
   the risk factors, males showed higher awareness of tobacco and excessive
   alcohol as risk factors, while females were more knowledgeable about HPV
   infection (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: This study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge and
   awareness of the clinical features of and risk factors for HNCs among
   the Saudi population.},

Title = {Rates of family history of autism and ADHD varies with recruitment
   approach and socio-economic status},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 16},
Abstract = {Family history (FH) of autism and ADHD is not often considered during
   the recruitment process of developmental studies, despite high
   recurrence rates. We looked at the rate of autism or ADHD amongst family
   members of young children (9 to 46 months) in three UK-based samples (N
   = 1055) recruited using different methods. The rate of FH-autism or
   FH-ADHD was 3\%-9\% for diagnosed cases. The rate was highest in the
   sample recruited through an online participant pool, which also
   consisted of the most socio-economically diverse families. Lower
   parental education and family income were associated with higher rates
   of FH-ADHD and lower parental education with increased FH-autism. Thus,
   recruitment strategies have a meaningful impact on neurodiversity and
   the conclusions and generalizations that can be drawn. Specifically,
   recruitment using crowdsourcing websites could create a sample that is
   more representative of the wider population, compared to those recruited
   through university-related volunteer databases and social media.},

Title = {Exploring determinants of care-seeking behaviour of oral cancer patients
   in India: A qualitative content analysis},
Journal = {CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {141-148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: A major public health concern in India is the high morbidity
   and mortality rates of oral cancer because of late diagnosis. Among the
   several determinants of this late diagnosis, the most important is the
   healthcare-seeking behaviour of the oral cancer patients. The aim of
   this study was to explore the care-seeking behaviour and its
   determinants among oral cancer patients.
   Methods: A face-to-face in-depth interview was conducted among 70 oral
   cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire, and qualitative
   content analysis of the results was performed.
   Results: All the patients had squamous-cell carcinoma and none had
   attended any screening programme. The most common site affected was the
   buccal mucosa with a non-healing wound. Most of the patients contacted a
   doctor available nearby; only 7\% of patients consulted a dentist. Only
   one patient approached a traditional healer. The median patient delay
   was 30 (4-365) days and the professional delay was 40 (4-650) days.
   Enablers included determinants such as increasing symptoms (80\%),
   influence of the society (74\%), fear (10\%), and social media (3\%).
   The main barriers were lack of awareness (97\%), hope that the lesion
   will heal spontaneously (90\%), lack of perception of seriousness
   (64\%), financial constraints (55\%), provider switching (47\%), and
   missed diagnosis (44\%).
   Conclusion: The care-seeking path among oral cancer patients is complex,
   customised, and influenced by multiple patient-related and
   system-related factors.},

Title = {Trust Associated with South Korean Sojourners' Chinese COVID-19
   Vaccination Intent and Concerns: A Qualitative Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 1},
Abstract = {People's willingness to get vaccinated determines whether the campaigns
   against the COVID-19 pandemic can be successful in part. Considering the
   fact that both foreigners and its nationals are exposed to the risk of
   infection in China, the Chinese government has taken measures favorable
   to foreigners in terms of the vaccination, yet South Korean sojourners
   were reluctant to get China-developed COVID-19 vaccines. This study
   employed the trust in institutions and trust in media as a theoretical
   framework and seeks to analyze how these two affect South Korean
   sojourners' intention to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. 25 South Korean
   sojourners living in Beijing participated in semi-structured interviews.
   The results showed that the mistrust South Korean sojourners have in
   China's institutions and media, both traditional and social media, led
   to their reluctance to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, South
   Korean sojourners' higher interpersonal trust in their peers also
   influenced their willingness to get vaccines. This study further
   interpreted such results from the perspective of cultural traits and
   national properties.},

Title = {Exploring the mediating effect of camouflaging and the moderating effect
   of autistic identity on the relationship between autistic traits and
   mental wellbeing},
Journal = {AUTISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 18},
Abstract = {Mental health difficulties are prevalent among autistic adults.
   Camouflaging (behaving differently to fit in) may be a mechanism by
   which autistic traits and mental health difficulties relate to each
   other, but little research has considered the role of different facets
   of camouflaging. Additionally, autistic identity might buffer against
   camouflaging and mental health difficulties. This research aims to
   explore the mediating effects of camouflaging behaviours on the
   relationship between autistic traits and both positive and negative
   mental wellbeing, as well as how autistic identity might moderate the
   relationship between autistic traits and camouflaging, and also mental
   health. Data were available for 627 autistic adults, recruited through
   volunteer databases and social media. Participants completed measures of
   autistic traits, anxiety, depression, positive wellbeing, camouflaging
   behaviours (compensating for difficulties, masking, and
   assimilating/putting on an act) and autistic identity. Mediation and
   moderated mediation models were tested, applying 95\% bootstrapped CIs
   (10,000 resamples) and including age, gender and diagnosis as
   covariates. There were no significant direct effects between autistic
   traits and mental wellbeing. Assimilation was a significant mediator of
   all mental wellbeing measures, and compensation was a significant
   mediator of positive wellbeing only. Autistic identity was not a
   significant moderator. Assimilation and compensation should be
   considered when offering psychological interventions to support mental
   wellbeing of autistic people. Additional research into external drivers
   of camouflaging (e.g. stigma) and mechanisms by which camouflaging
   impacts mental wellbeing, such as autonomy, authenticity, skill mastery
   and community, may identify other areas of support. Concurrently,
   societal change is necessary to reduce the need to camouflage.
   Putting on an act to fit in is linked to worse depression, anxiety,
   suicidality, and positive wellbeing. Compensating for difficulties is
   linked to better positive wellbeing. A positive autistic identity did
   not change this. We should explore why changing how you act and
   compensating have this effect, so we can give better support and improve
   wellbeing for autistic people. We should also reduce stigma from
   society, so autistic people do not need to change their behaviour to try
   to fit in.},

Abstract = {Objective This study aimed to assess whether workplace exposures as
   estimated via a COVID-19 job exposure matrix (JEM) are associated with
   SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.Methods Data on 244 470 participants were available
   from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infec-tion Survey
   (CIS) and 16 801 participants from the Virus Watch Cohort, restricted to
   workers aged 20-64 years. Analysis used logistic regression models with
   SARS-CoV-2 as the dependent variable for eight individual JEM domains
   (number of workers, nature of contacts, contact via surfaces, indoor or
   outdoor location, ability to social distance, use of face covering, job
   insecurity, and migrant workers) with adjustment for age, sex,
   ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation (IMD), region, household size,
   urban versus rural area, and health conditions. Analyses were repeated
   for three time periods (i) February 2020 (Virus Watch)/April 2020 (CIS)
   to May 2021), (ii) June 2021 to November 2021, and (iii) December 2021
   to January 2022.Results Overall, higher risk classifications for the
   first six domains tended to be associated with an increased risk of
   infection, with little evidence of a relationship for domains relating
   to proportion of workers with job insecurity or migrant workers. By time
   there was a clear exposure-response relationship for these domains in
   the first period only. Results were largely consistent across the two UK
   cohorts.Conclusions An exposure-response relationship exists in the
   early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic for number of contacts, nature of
   contacts, contacts via surfaces, indoor or outdoor location, ability to
   social distance and use of face coverings. These associations appear to
   have diminished over time.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing trend in liver resections for non-colorectal
   non-neuroendocrine liver metastases (NCNNLM), the role of surgery for
   these liver malignancies is still debated. Registries are an essential,
   reliable tool for assessing epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic
   approach in a single hub, especially when data are dispersive and
   inconclusive, as in our case. The dissemination of this preliminary
   survey would allow us to understand if the creation of an International
   Registry is a viable option, while still offering a snapshot on this
   issue, investigating clinical practices worldwide. The steering
   committee designed an online questionnaire with Google Forms, which
   consisted of 37 questions, and was open from October 5th, 2022, to
   November 30th, 2022. It was disseminated using social media and mailing
   lists of the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies
   (SICE), the Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe (ACIE), and the
   Spanish Chapter of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Overall, 141
   surgeons (approximately 18\% of the total invitations sent) from 27
   countries on four continents participated in the survey. Most
   respondents worked in general surgery units (62\%), performing less than
   50 liver resections/year (57\%). A multidisciplinary discussion was
   currently performed to validate surgical indications for NCNNLM in 96\%
   of respondents. The most commonly adopted selection criteria were liver
   resectability, RECIST criteria, and absence of extrahepatic disease.
   Primary tumors were generally of gastrointestinal (42\%), breast (31\%),
   and pancreaticobiliary origin (13\%). The most common interventions were
   parenchymal-sparing resections (51\% of respondents) of metachronous
   metastases with an open approach. Major post-operative complications
   (Clavien-Dindo > 2) occurred in up to 20\% of the procedures, according
   to 44\% of respondents. A subset analysis of data from high-volume
   centers (> 100 cases/year) showed lower post-operative complications and
   better survival. The present survey shows that NCNNLM patients are
   frequently treated by surgeons in low-volume hospitals for liver
   surgery. Selection criteria are usually based on common sense. Liver
   resections are performed mainly with an open approach, possibly carrying
   a high burden of major post-operative complications. International
   guidelines and a specific consensus on this field are desirable, as well
   as strategies for collaboration between high-volume and low-volume
   centers. The present study can guide the elaboration of a
   multi-institutional document on the optimal pathway in the management of
   patients with NCNNLM.},

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Introduction Edinburgh and Lothians' Viral Intervention Study Kids is a
   parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline
   (HS) nose drops (similar to 2.6\% sodium chloride) vs standard care in
   children <7 years of age with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract
   infection (URTI).
   Methods and analysis Children are recruited prior to URTI or within 48
   hours of developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local
   schools/nurseries, health centres/hospitals, recreational facilities,
   public events, workplaces, local/social media. Willing
   parents/guardians, of children <7 years of age will be asked to contact
   the research team at their local site. Children will be randomised to
   either a control arm (standard symptomatic care), or intervention arm
   (three drops/nostril of HS, at least four times a day, until 24 hours
   after asymptomatic or a maximum of 28 days). All participants are
   requested to provide a nasal swab at the start of the study
   (intervention arm: before HS drops) and then daily for four more days.
   Parent/guardian complete a validated daily diary, an end of illness
   diary, a satisfaction questionnaire and a wheeze questionnaire (day 28).
   The parent/guardian of a child in the intervention arm is taught to
   prepare HS nose drops. Parent/guardian of children asymptomatic at
   recruitment are requested to inform the research team within 48 hours of
   their child developing an URTI and follow the instructions already
   provided. The day 28 questionnaire determines if the child experienced a
   wheeze following illness. Participation in the study ends on day 28.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the West of
   Scotland Research Ethics Service (18/WS/0080). It is cosponsored by
   Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development-a
   partnership between the University of Edinburgh and National Health
   Service Lothian Health Board. The findings will be disseminated through
   peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and via the study
   website.},

Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of facial
   pressure injuries related to personal pro-tective equipment use in
   nurses and the relationship with getting COVID-19 infection.Design: The
   study used descriptive and correlational online survey design.Methods:
   Nurses in Turkey were recruited via an electronic link sent to their
   social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), WhatsApp,
   and e-mail during the study: March-April 2021. Of them, 603
   par-ticipants completed the survey form from all over
   Turkey.Results/Findings: Facial pressure injuries develop in nurses due
   to use of personal protective equipment. The rates of facial pressure
   injuries were higher in the nurses who were younger (p=0.002) and those
   who had less experience years (p=0.005) than the other nurses. The
   statistically significant variables were determined as age, status of
   using face shield, status of wearing overalls and status of wearing shoe
   covers (p<0.05). We determined that facial pressure injuries were not
   significantly associated with getting COVID-19 infection
   (p>0,05).Conclusions: This study showed that facial pressure injuries
   associated with personal protective equipment use among nurses, who work
   on the frontlines in the COVID-19 pandemic period, is highly prevalent.
   Experiencing facial pressure injuries did not have a significant effect
   on the participants' statuses of getting infected with COVID-19.
   Providing training in health institutions may present an effective
   strategy in lowering problems.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the awareness of Saudis in Qassim region, Saudi
   Arabia on multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 Saudis in Qassim,
   Saudi Arabia between January 2019 and June 2019 using a pre-designed
   questionnaire including socio-demographic data and questions evaluating
   knowledge about MS.
   Results: The majority of studied participants were adult females (74\%),
   between 20-30 year-old (45.1\%) and with high education level or above
   (80.6\%). Nearly one third of the studied group had good knowledge
   regarding MS (31.7\%). Half of the studied group knew that central
   nervous system (CNS) is the system affected by MS, 52\% reported that
   vitamin D deficiency, family history of MS, personal history of
   autoimmune disease, viruses, and obesity are the factors which increase
   the risk of developing MS. Approximately, 62.9\% knew that blurred and
   double vision, numbness, paralysis or weakness and difficulty in
   concentration and memorizing are symptoms of MS. Female participants and
   those knowing someone having MS had a significant good knowledge level
   regarding MS than others. Getting knowledge from combined sources from
   internet or social media; family, friends or neighbors and health
   workers was significantly more prevalent among those with good
   knowledge.
   Conclusion: Most of the study participants had limited knowledge
   regarding MS. Planning health education programs for the public is
   essential.},

Abstract = {BackgroundKeratoconus (KC) is a non-inflammatory corneal disease with an
   early onset in adulthood, leading to a reduction in visual acuity. This
   study aims to evaluate the level of awareness of keratoconus among the
   general population in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia.MethodologyData
   were collected through a pre-designed and pre-validated online
   questionnaire (Appendix) distributed via social media platforms. The
   questionnaire was divided into two sections. The first section included
   demographic profiles, while the second section inquired about knowledge
   and awareness regarding Keratoconus. The collected data was reviewed,
   coded, and inputted into IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics
   for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Statistical analyses
   were performed using the Pearson Chi-Square test, with statistical
   significance set at p<0.05.ResultsThe total number of respondents was
   550, among whom 40\% were males and 60\% were females. 79.6\% of the
   participants were in the age range of 18-30 years. The level of
   education and a positive family history of KC showed significant
   associations with the level of knowledge about KC (p<0.05). The age
   group had a non-significant association (p=0.059), while gender had a
   significant association with the level of knowledge about keratoconus
   (p<0.05).ConclusionIn conclusion, the overall awareness regarding KC
   progression, interventions, and the consequences of eye rubbing was
   limited among the participants. Specific efforts are crucial to enhance
   public awareness and understanding of KC, ensuring a more informed and
   proactive approach to eye health within the community.},

Abstract = {Background: In December 2018, routine surveillance identified an
   autochthonous outbreak of dengue fever in Muscat Governorate, Oman, a
   region previously free of dengue fever.
   Methods: Routine surveillance confirmed locally acquired cases in the
   second week of December, leading to a rapid public health response
   including case management guidance and epidemiological investigations.
   The main activity was the vector survey using systematic sampling to
   assess extent of previously unreported Aedes aegypti presence followed
   by a campaign aimed to eliminate breeding sites of A. aegypti{''}.
   Results: During a 5-month period, 343 suspected cases were reported from
   Muscat Governorate with 122 from the outbreak affected area. Out of 207
   probable cases eligible for laboratory testing as per guidelines issued,
   59 cases were confirmed. The vector elimination campaign started on
   January 8, 2019 after a media advocacy using television and social media
   and concluded on January 23. By the end of campaign, the case load had
   decreased significantly in the affected area with no reports of locally
   acquired cases from adjoining areas of Muscat Governorate, indicating no
   further spread.
   Conclusions: Rapid notification and early community-wide, extensive
   vector control activities effectively contained the autochthonous dengue
   fever virus outbreak. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {Despite older adults' extremely high vulnerability to COVID-19
   complications and death, few studies have examined how personal
   characteristics and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the mental
   health of older adults at the global level. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the relationships among demographics, COVID-19 life
   impacts, and depression and anxiety in adults aged 60 and older from 33
   countries. A sample of 823 older adults aged 60-94 and residing in 33
   countries completed a 10-min online survey following recruitment from
   mailing lists and social media. Being separated from and having
   conflicts with loved ones predicted both anxiety and depression, as did
   residing in a country with higher income. Getting medical treatment for
   severe symptoms of COVID-19 and having decreased work responsibilities
   predicted depression, but adjustment to working from home and younger
   age predicted both depression and anxiety. Participants from Europe and
   Central Asia reported higher depression than those from all other
   regions and higher anxiety than those from Latin America and the
   Caribbean. The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious deleterious effects on
   the mental health of older adults worldwide. The current findings have
   direct implications for mental health services that may be delivered to
   older adults to help facilitate healthy psychological adjustment.},

Abstract = {Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (NSAIDs) are widely
   used for various conditions, mainly as an analgesics and anti-pyretics
   in adults as well as in pediatrics. Most of the users of NSAIDs aren't
   aware of the serious side effects of these medications. Aim: Estimation
   of parental awareness about NSIADs use and their side effects among
   their children in Qassim region. Materials and methods: The participants
   involved in the study are the parents whom have child/children aged 14
   years old or younger. The population sample was selected randomly and
   they participated in the study with their own volition. The
   questionnaires were distributed through social media. Data analyses were
   done by using SPSS version 26. This study is cross-sectional study with
   a sample size of 516 conducted in Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Results:
   516 were recruited (153 males and 363 females). The most common age
   group was from 36 to 55 years (47.9\%). 84.5\% have heard about NSAIDs.
   77.1\% used NSAIDs for their children below 14 years, but only 36.2\%
   knew about NSAIDs side effects. Among the responders, 12.6\% experienced
   NSAIDs side effects. The most commonly experienced side effect was
   allergy (50\%) and gastroenterology problems (30\%). The awareness
   toward NSAIDs use was more common among females. Conclusion: The
   parental awareness of NSAIDs use was within the adequate range. However,
   parent's knowledge of the potential side effects was low. Females with
   2-5 children, were most likely to administer NSAIDs for their children
   below 14, contradictorily informed of NSAIDs and its indication of use,
   yet not aware about NSAIDs side effects.},

Title = {EPOS2020: development strategy and goals for the latest European
   Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis},
Journal = {RHINOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {162-168},
Abstract = {Background: The European Position Papers on Rhinosinusitis from 2005,
   2007 and 2012 have had a measurable impact on the way this common
   condition with high impact on quality of life is managed around the
   world. EPOS2020 will be the latest iteration of the guideline,
   addressing new stakeholders and target users, presenting a summary of
   the latest literature and evolving treatment modalities, and formulating
   clear recommendations based on all available evidence.
   Methodology: Based on the AGREE II framework, this article demonstrates
   how the EPOS2020 steering group will address six key areas to ensure
   consistency in quality and presentation of information in the latest
   rhinosinusitis clinical practice guideline: scope and purpose;
   stakeholder involvement; rigour of development; clarity of presentation;
   recommendations and applicability; editorial independence.
   Results: By analysing the guidance from AGREE II, we formulated a
   detailed development strategy for EPOS2020. We identify new stakeholders
   and target users and ratify the importance of patient involvement in the
   latest EPOS guideline. New and expanded areas of research to be
   addressed are highlighted. We confirm our intention to use mixed
   methodologies, combining evidencebased medicine with real life studies;
   when no evidence can be found, use Delphi rounds to achieve clear,
   inclusive recommendations. We also introduce new concepts for
   dissemination of the guideline, using Internet and social media to
   improve accessibility.
   Conclusion: This article is an introduction to the EPOS2020 project, and
   presents the key goals, core stakeholders, planned methodology and
   dissemination strategies for the latest version of this influential
   guideline.},

Abstract = {Background The initial management of patients with acute pancreatitis
   impacts both morbidity and mortality. Point-of-care decisions have been
   reported to differ from clinical guideline recommendations. Methods An
   online anonymous questionnaire was distributed through scientific
   associations and social media using REDCap. Multivariable logistic
   regression was used to identify the characteristics of participants
   associated with compliance with the recommendations. Results A total of
   1054 participants from 94 countries completed the questionnaire; median
   age (IQR) was 39 (32-47) years; 30.7\% were women. Among the
   participants, 37\% opted for nonmoderate flow of i.v. fluid, 31\% for
   fluid type other than Ringer's lactate; 73.4\% were in favor of nil per
   os to patients who could eat, 75.5\% for other than enteral feeding to
   patients with oral intolerance; 15.5\% used prophylactic antibiotic in
   patients with severe acute pancreatitis, 34.1\% in necrotizing acute
   pancreatitis, and 27.4\% in patients with systemic inflammatory response
   syndrome; 27.8\% delayed cholecystectomy after biliary acute
   pancreatitis. Participants with publications in PubMed on acute
   pancreatitis showed better compliance (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI: 1.15-2.32; P =
   .007) with recommendations of the clinical guidelines. Conclusions
   Feeding and nutrition require the greatest improvement efforts, but also
   the use of prophylactic antibiotics and timing of cholecystectomy should
   be improved.},

   has a significant role in early diagnosis and management of the
   disorder.
   Aim: to assess the general population awareness regarding club foot in
   Aseer region, southern Saudi Arabia.
   Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting
   all population in Aseer region. The study was conducted during the
   period from December 2019 to April 2020, Data were collected using
   structured questionnaire which included person's socio-demographic data,
   and participants' awareness regarding club foot, The questionnaire was
   uploaded online using social media platforms. Results: A total of 744
   participants were included in the survey from the general population in
   Aseer region. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old and
   males were 375 (51.2\%). As for club foot risk factors, 314 (42.2\%)
   participants reported genetic factors followed by Fetal malpresentation
   (222; 29.8\%), neurological disorders (124; 16.7\%), and twin pregnancy
   (69;9.3\%). Totally, good awareness level was recorded among a very low
   percentage of the surveyed population.
   Conclusions \& recommendations: In conclusion, the survey revealed that
   public awareness regarding club foot in Aseer region was very low
   especially among females with a high level of education. Health care
   providers had no role in improving this public awareness.},

Abstract = {In December 2018, PulseNet, the national laboratory network for enteric
   disease surveillance, identified an increase in Salmonella Typhimurium
   isolates with an uncommon pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern which
   was previously isolated from hedgehogs. CDC, state, and local health
   partners interviewed patients with a questionnaire that focused on
   hedgehog exposures, conducted traceback of patients' hedgehog purchases,
   and collected hedgehog faecal pellets and environmental samples.
   Isolates in this outbreak were analysed using core-genome multi-locus
   sequence typing (cgMLST) and compared to sequence data from historic
   clinical isolates from a 2011-2013 outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium
   illnesses linked to pet hedgehogs. Fifty-four illnesses in 23 states
   were identified between October 2018 and September 2019. Patients ranged
   from <1 to 95 years, and 65\% were female. Eight patients were
   hospitalized. Eighty-one per cent (29/36) of patients interviewed
   reported contact with a hedgehog before becoming ill; of these, 21
   (72\%) reported owning a hedgehog. Analysis of 53 clinical, 11 hedgehog,
   and two hedgehog bedding isolates from this outbreak, seven hedgehog
   isolates obtained prior to this outbreak, and two clinical isolates from
   the 2011-2013 outbreak fell into three distinct groupings (37 isolates
   in Clade 1 {[}0-10 alleles], 28 isolates in Clade 2 {[}0-7 alleles], and
   eight isolates in Clade 3 {[}0-12 alleles]) and were collectively
   related within 0-31 alleles by cgMLST. Purchase information available
   from 20 patients showed hedgehogs were purchased from multiple breeders
   across nine states, a pet store, and through an online social media
   website; a single source of hedgehogs was not identified. This outbreak
   highlights the ability of genetic sequencing analysis to link historic
   and ongoing Salmonella illness outbreaks and demonstrates the strain of
   Salmonella linked to hedgehogs might continue to be a health risk to
   hedgehog owners unless measures are taken to prevent transmission.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: The Australian National COVID-19 Clinical
   Evidence Taskforce is a consortium of 31 Australian health professional
   organisations developing living, evidence-based guidelines for care of
   people with COVID-19, which are updated weekly. This article describes
   the methods used to develop and maintain the guidelines.
   Methods: The guidelines use the GRADE methods and are designed to meet
   Australian NHMRC standards. Each week, new evidence is reviewed, current
   recommendations are revised, and new recommendations made. These are
   published in MAGIC and disseminated through traditional and social
   media. Relevant new questions to be addressed are continually sought
   from stakeholders and practitioners. For prioritized questions, the
   evidence is actively monitored and updated. Evidence surveillance
   combines horizon scans and targeted searches. An evidence team appraises
   and synthesizes evidence and prepares evidence-to-decision frameworks to
   inform development of recommendations. A guidelines leadership group
   oversees the development of recommendations by multidisciplinary
   guidelines panels and is advised by a consumer panel.
   Results: : The Taskforce formed in March 2020, and the first
   recommendations were published 2 weeks later. The guidelines have been
   revised and republished on a weekly basis for 24 weeks, and as of
   October 2020, contain over 90 treatment recommendations, suggesting that
   living methods are feasible in this context.
   Conclusions: The Australian guidelines for care of people with COVID-19
   provide an example of the feasibility of living guidelines and an
   opportunity to test and improve living evidence methods. (C) 2020 The

Title = {Knowledge of healthcare providers in the management of anaphylaxis},
Journal = {WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {2021 NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction: Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, life-threatening
   systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Early diagnosis and treatment of a
   severe allergic reaction requires recognition of the signs and symptoms,
   as well as classification of severity. It is a clinical emergency, and
   healthcare providers should have the knowledge for recognition and
   management. The aim of the study is to evaluate the level of knowledge
   in the management of anaphylaxis in healthcare providers.
   Methods: It is an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study
   conducted among healthcare providers over 18 years old via a Google
   Forms link and shared through different social media platforms. A
   12-item questionnaire was applied which included the evaluation of the
   management of anaphylaxis, from June 2020 to May 2021.
   Results: A total of 1023 surveys were evaluated; 1013 met inclusion
   criteria and were included in the statistical analysis. A passing grade
   was considered with 8 or more correct answers out of 12; the overall
   approval percentage was 28.7\%. The group with the highest percentage of
   approval in the questionnaire was health-care providers with more than
   30 years of work experience. There was a significant difference between
   the proportions of approval between all specialty groups, and in a
   post-hoc analysis, allergy and immunology specialists showed greater
   proportions of approval compared to general medicine practitioners
   (62.9\% vs 25\%; p=<0.001).
   Conclusions: It is important that healthcare providers know how to
   recognize, diagnose, and treat anaphylaxis, and later refer them to
   specialists in Allergy and Clinical Immunology in order to make a
   personalized diagnosis and treatment.},

Journal = {BRAIN IMPAIRMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 6},
Abstract = {Objective:This study explored non-specialist audiological clinical
   practice in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and whether
   such practices incorporated considerations of TBI-related complexities
   pertaining to identification, diagnosis and management of associated
   auditory and vestibular disturbances. Design:A cross-sectional online
   survey exploring clinical practice, TBI-related training and information
   provision was distributed to audiologists across Australia via Audiology
   Australia and social media. Fifty audiologists, 80\% female and 20\%
   male, participated in this study. Years of professional practice ranged
   from new graduate to more than 20 years of experience. Results:Clear
   gaps of accuracy in knowledge and practice across all survey domains
   relating to the identification, diagnosis and management of patients
   with auditory and/or vestibular deficits following TBI were evident.
   Further, of the surveyed audiologists working in auditory and vestibular
   settings, 91\% and 86\%, respectively, reported not receiving
   professional development for the diagnosis and management of
   post-traumatic audio-vestibular deficits. Conclusion:Inadequate
   resources, equipment availability and TBI-related training may have
   contributed to the gaps in service provision, influencing audiological
   management of patients with TBI. A tailored TBI approach to
   identification, diagnosis and management of post-traumatic auditory and
   vestibular disturbances is needed.},

Abstract = {Chagas Disease (CD), a chronic infection caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi
   parasite, is a Neglected Tropical Disease endemic to Latin America. With
   a re-emergence in Venezuela during the past two decades, the spread of
   CD has proved susceptible to, and inhibitable by a digital, real-time
   sur-veillance system effectuated by Citizen Scientists in communities
   throughout the country. The \#TraeTuChipo (\#BringYourKissingBug)
   campaign implemented in January 2020, has served as such a strategy
   counting on community engagement to define the current ecological
   distribution of CD vectors despite the absence of a functional national
   surveillance program. This pilot campaign collected data through online
   surveys, social media platforms, and/or telephone text messages. A total
   of 79 triatomine bugs were reported from eighteen Venezuelan states; 67
   bugs were identified as Panstrongylus geniculatus, 1 as Rhodnius
   pictipes, 1 as Triatoma dimidiata, and 10 as Triatoma maculata. We
   analyzed 8 triatomine feces samples spotted from 4 Panstrongylus
   geniculatus which were confirmed positive by qPCR for T. cruzi. Further
   molecular characteriza-tion of discrete typing units (DTUs), revealed
   that all samples contained TcI, the most highly diverse and broadly
   distributed strain of T. cruzi. Moreover, analysis of the mitochondrial
   12S gene revealed Myotis keaysi, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus as the
   main triatomine feeding sources. This study highlights a novel Citizen
   Science approach which may help improve the surveillance systems for CD
   in endemic countries.},

Title = {Considerations of Racism and Data Equity Among Asian Americans, Native
   Hawaiians, And Pacific Islanders in the Context of COVID-19},
Journal = {CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {77-86},
Month = {2022 JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the importance of
   considering social determinants of health, including factors such as
   structural racism. This review discusses some of the evidence that
   triangulates on this issue, including data from hate crime statistics,
   social media analysis, and survey-based research. It also examines the
   data needs for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
   (NHPI) communities. Recent Findings The available data provides evidence
   that the pandemic has contributed to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment
   and discriminatory incidents. Many reports have surfaced showing a surge
   in anti-Chinese discrimination, which has ``spilled over{''} into other
   Asian communities. Research is beginning to emerge to show that such
   discrimination may also impact health issues such as psychological
   distress. Given prior research, we would expect many more studies to
   emerge in the future. Also, the pandemic has illustrated the major gaps
   in data available to disentangle the health and social concerns facing
   Asian Americans and NHPI communities. Significant issues include the
   lack of systematic reporting of data for these communities both across
   states, and even among agencies within a state; erroneous aggregation of
   Asians with NHPIs; and censoring of data. These gaps and issues
   contribute to bias that obscures objective data and amplifies health
   inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the
   well-being of Asian American and NHPI communities. It is critical to
   provide disaggregated data, not only so that we can have accurate
   reporting, but also to ensure data and health equity.},

Title = {How should electronic health records be designed? A cross-sectional
   study in patients with psoriasis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Background Electronic health records (EHRs) are promising tools for
   routine care. These applications might not only enhance the interaction
   between patient and physician but also support therapy management. This
   is crucial in complex and chronic conditions like psoriasis. However,
   EHRs can only unfold their full potential when being accepted by the
   users. Therefore, this study aims to analyse how EHRs should be designed
   for patients with psoriasis and to identify differences between patient
   subgroups. Methods We developed a questionnaire on the acceptability of
   EHRs based on literature research and results from focus groups.
   Participants completed a paper-based or electronic version of the
   questionnaire. We recruited participants at an outpatient clinic as well
   as online via patient associations and a social media platform. We
   analysed data using descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses
   applying Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Results The sample
   encompassed 187 patients with psoriasis. Data reveals that 84.4\% of the
   participants can think of entering data into an EHR. Participants prefer
   entering data at home (72.2\%) instead of entering data in the waiting
   room (44.9\%) and using an own internet-ready device (laptop/computer:
   62.6\%; smartphone/tablet: 61.5\%) instead of a provided device
   (46.0\%). Altogether, 55.6\% of participants would accept entering data
   on a monthly basis when this lasts between one and 10 minutes and
   further 27.8\% would accept even longer lasting data entry. Data privacy
   is of great concern (e.g. patient should decide who has access to data:
   96.7\%). Subgroup analyses reveal differences with regard to age,
   educational level, burden due to psoriasis, number of internet
   activities, use of electronic questionnaires and mode of administration.
   Conclusion The high acceptance of entering data is favourable for the
   implementation of EHRs. The results suggest technical and structural
   recommendations: Differences between subgroups support the development
   of flexible EHRs encompassing a basic module, which is expandable with
   further add-ons, and compatible to different devices. Furthermore,
   involving patients by entering data into an EHR requires that physicians
   communicate open-mindedly with the patient and consider data throughout
   decision-making. Patients should remain owner of their own health data
   and decide about its processing.},

Title = {Global Trends in Scientific Research on Pediatric Obesity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {(1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific
   production, collaboration among countries, and research topics focusing
   on pediatric obesity. (2) Methods: The papers that were included in the
   study were retrieved from theWeb of Science Core Collection from
   Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis of several focuses,
   including journals of publication, subject categories, most frequent
   author keywords, and journal impact factors, was conducted. Social
   network analysis was used to recognize collaboration groups between
   countries and the co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A
   total of 12,171 research articles were published in 2036 journals
   classified under a variety of subject areas, with pediatrics (27.7\%),
   nutrition and dietetics (18.5\%), and public environmental and
   occupational health (18.4\%) accounting for the most frequent study
   areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity
   (299), and BMC Public Health being the most productive journals. The
   main challenges identified for pediatric obesity include general topics
   such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as
   other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin
   resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4)
   Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number of published
   articles of 59.8\%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the
   topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There
   has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries
   across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic
   analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics
   along with specialized health terms and terms related to public health.},

Abstract = {Background Tinea pedis or foot ringworm is an infection of the feet
   affecting the soles, interdigital clefts of toes, and nails, with a
   dermatophyte fungus. It is also called athlete's foot. Onychomycosis of
   the nail is caused by dermatophytes called Tinea unguium. An abnormal
   nail not caused by a fungal infection is a type of dystrophic nail.
   Onychomycosis can infect both fingernails and toenails, but
   onychomycosis of the toenail is much more prevalent. Aim The study aimed
   to assess the knowledge, perception, and awareness among a sample from
   Ha'il City, Saudi Arabia, of the definitions, risk factors, symptoms,

Title = {Artificial Intelligence in Skin Cancer Diagnostics: The Patients'
   Perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Background:Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in numerous
   experimental studies, particularly in skin cancer diagnostics.
   Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step.
   This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and
   questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to
   evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma
   diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a
   history of melanoma. Participants and Methods:A web-based questionnaire
   was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals
   and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The
   anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns
   toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes
   toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was
   performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and
   95\% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to
   investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected
   items of the questionnaire. Results:298 individuals (154 with a melanoma
   diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94\%
   {[}95\% CI = 0.91-0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial
   intelligence in medical approaches. 88\% {[}95\% CI = 0.85-0.92] would
   even make their own health data anonymously available for the further
   development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41\% {[}95\% CI =
   0.35-0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial
   intelligence as stand-alone system, 94\% {[}95\% CI = 0.92-0.97] to its
   use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only
   minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history
   of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early
   detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where
   physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to
   AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about
   insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to
   errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less
   diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions:The vast
   majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of
   artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an
   assistance system.},

Title = {A Data Visualization and Dissemination Resource to Support HIV
   Prevention and Care at the Local Level: Analysis and Uses of the AIDSVu
   Public Data Resource},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: AIDSVu is a public resource for visualizing HIV surveillance
   data and other population-based information relevant to HIV prevention,
   care, policy, and impact assessment.
   Objective: The site, AIDSVu.org, aims to make data about the US HIV
   epidemic widely available, easily accessible, and locally relevant to
   inform public health decision making.
   Methods: AIDSVu develops visualizations, maps, and downloadable datasets
   using results from HIV surveillance systems, other population-based
   sources of information (eg, US Census and national probability surveys),
   and other data developed specifically for display and dissemination
   through the website (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis {[}PrEP]
   prescriptions). Other types of content are developed to translate
   surveillance data into summarized content for diverse audiences using
   infographic panels, interactive maps, local and state fact sheets, and
   narrative blog posts.
   Results: Over 10 years, AIDSVu.org has used an expanded number of data
   sources and has progressively provided HIV surveillance and related data
   at finer geographic levels, with current data resources providing HIV
   prevalence data down to the census tract level in many of the largest US
   cities. Data are available at the county level in 48 US states and at
   the ZIP Code level in more than 50 US cities. In 2019, over 500,000
   unique users consumed AIDSVu data and resources, and HIV-related data
   and insights were disseminated through nearly 4,000,000 social media
   posts. Since AIDSVu's inception, at least 249 peer-reviewed publications
   have used AIDSVu data for analyses or referenced AIDSVu resources. Data
   uses have included targeting of HIV testing programs, identifying areas
   with inequitable PrEP uptake, including maps and data in academic and
   community grant applications, and strategically selecting locations for
   new HIV treatment and care facilities to serve high-need areas.
   Conclusions: Surveillance data should be actively used to guide and
   evaluate public health programs; AIDSVu translates high-quality,
   population-based data about the US HIV epidemic and makes that
   information available in formats that are not consistently available in
   surveillance reports. Bringing public health surveillance data to an
   online resource is a democratization of data, and presenting information
   about the HIV epidemic in more visual formats allows diverse
   stakeholders to engage with, understand, and use these important public
   health data to inform public health decision making.},

Abstract = {Background: The success of integrated prevention initiatives for eating
   disorders and obesity is hampered by a lack of shared risk factor
   research. Bullying and sexual abuse are potentially potent shared risk
   factors for the spectrum of eating and weight disorders. Methods: A
   representative sample of N = 3005 South Australian males and females >=
   15 years was interviewed about their height, weight, eating disorder
   symptoms, lifetime experiences of bullying and sexual abuse and mental
   and physical health-related quality of life. Results: Participants who
   were currently obese (25.2\%) or underweight (2.7\%) or who reported
   current eating disorder symptoms (32.7\%) were between 10\% and 27\%
   more likely to have experienced bullying, and obese and eating
   disordered participants were also 47\% and 56\% more likely to have
   experienced sexual abuse, respectively. In regard to specific symptoms,
   a lifetime history of bullying was associated with increased risk of
   obesity, extreme dieting, purging and overvaluation of body weight
   and/or shape, whereas a lifetime history of sexual abuse was associated
   with increased risk of obesity, binge eating and extreme dieting and
   decreased risk of underweight. Lifetime histories of bullying and sexual
   abuse were associated with health-related quality of life impairment;
   however, lifetime bullying was associated with a greater adverse impact
   among participants with current eating disorder symptoms. Conclusion:
   Self-reported bullying and sexual abuse victimisation have shared
   associations with eating and weight spectrum problems. Differences in
   the symptoms associated with bullying versus sexual abuse are discussed,
   as well as the clinical and public health implications.},

Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted in Qatar to explore beliefs and
   attitudes among mothers towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   vaccination for their children and to understand major factors
   influencing vaccine hesitancy among these mothers.METHODS: A
   population-based, online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 15
   October and 15 November 2020. A composite questionnaire incorporating a
   validated vaccine hesitancy tool was developed and administered in both
   English and Arabic. Approval was obtained from the local ethics
   committee. Participation was voluntary and offered to all adult
   residents of Qatar through an online link available on social media
   platforms and local news portals. Only adult respondents who self
   -iden-tified as mothers were included in the present study. No personal
   identifying data were collected.RESULTS: Of the mothers surveyed, 29.4\%
   exhibited COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy regarding their children. This
   exceeded these mothers' rate of personal vaccine hesitancy (27.5\%).
   Hesitancy rates varied significantly with ethnicity, with the highest
   among Qatari mothers (51.3\%). Intention to vaccinate children did not
   differ significantly between mothers who accepted the vaccine for
   themselves and those who did not. Overall, the main reported concerns
   related to long-term vaccine safety. To a sig-nificant extent, mothers
   relied most on self-directed research on vaccine safety for
   decision-making.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of maternal COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy exceeded both those mothers' rate of personal vaccine
   hesitancy and the hesitancy rate in the general population. The
   intention to vaccinate children was independent of maternal vaccination
   history. Factors influencing maternal vaccine hesitancy differ from
   those influencing personal hesitancy and re-quire an informed public
   health response.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students in India},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was launched in India on
   16 January 2021, prioritising health care workers which included medical
   students. We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it
   among medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by
   1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India
   from 2 February to 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among
   10.6\%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness
   regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in
   government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical
   students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding
   themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as
   well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials.
   Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from
   social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges.
   Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was
   considered important by medical students both for themselves and for
   their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students.
   Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was
   important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face
   classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths
   medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory

Title = {The Prevalence and Level of Awareness of Medication Overuse Headache in
   Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Introduction Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache
   caused by regular overuse of medication(s) intended to relieve (notably,
   not prevent) the symptoms of a pre-existing primary headache (most
   commonly, migraine and tension headaches). MOH places a considerable
   burden on both patients and society. Understandably, the disorder is the
   subject of many cross-sectional studies worldwide. Research on MOH in
   Qassim province, Saudi Arabia, however, has not been conducted;
   therefore, the present study aims to identify the prevalence and level
   of awareness of MOH in Qassim province.Methods An observational
   cross-sectional study was conducted in Qassim province from July 1,
   2021, to June 13, 2022. A modified electronic questionnaire was
   distributed through social media platforms. The questionnaire covers
   demographics, prevalence of MOH, and awareness of MOH. Prevalence was
   measured using a scoring system based on the criteria of the
   International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition
   (ICHD-3) for diagnosing MOH.Results A total of 499 people completed the
   questionnaire, 286 (57.3\%) of whom were female and 213 (42.7\%) of whom
   were male. The majority of the participants were Saudi nationals
   (95.4\%). The mean age of the participants was 35 years old (+/- 12.7
   years). Out of the 499 participants, 451 (90.4\%) reported that they had
   experienced headaches in their life. The prevalence of MOH among those
   who had reported headaches was 4\%, compared with a level of awareness
   of MOH among all the participants of 18\%. Conclusion According to our
   study, there is a high prevalence of MOH in Qassim province. This is
   also coupled with a high awareness of MOH.},

Title = {Knowledge, attitude and practice among mothers toward home head trauma
   management in Riyadh, 2020-2021 : A cross sectional study},
Journal = {WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background: Head trauma is one of the major home accidents among
   children worldwide and could lead to long-life disabilities or death in
   severe cases. The worldwide incidence of pediatric traumatic brain
   injury ranges between 47 and 280 per 100,000 children. To the best of
   our knowledge, few studies have investigated the knowledge, attitude,
   and practice toward head trauma among mothers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   This study aims to assess the mother's knowledge, reaction, and
   immediate action toward head trauma of children under five years in
   Riyadh city, 2020-2021.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was
   developed locally in Cluster one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study
   included 390 mothers who met the inclusion criteria. Data was collected
   by MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 26.
   Results: In this study, we collected data from 390 mothers of children
   under five years old who responded to our distributed questionnaire.
   Most of the participants were between 31-40 years old (40 \%), while
   31.5 \% were between 20-30 years old. Considering the source of
   knowledge of mothers toward home accidents, we found that 6 \% did not
   know about home accidents, while 45 \% took their knowledge from social
   media, and 14.9 \% from school books. Furthermore, we found that 71.28
   \% of the mothers strongly agreed about the importance of attending
   courses on head trauma.
   Conclusion: We found that the level of knowledge among mothers in Al
   Riyadh region toward managing head trauma and preventing home injuries
   among children is sub-adequate. Many factors affect this knowledge,
   including maternal education, monthly income and occupation, and
   attending first aid training.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {326-331},
Month = {2022 AUG 9},
Abstract = {Objectives Pharmacists are known as medicine experts. Dentists can
   independently prescribe and administer medications related to dental
   conditions such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories and analgesics.
   However, little is known about pharmacists' knowledge and perceptions of
   medicines prescribed for dentistry. Therefore, this study aimed to
   assess community pharmacists' ability to identify the indications for
   dental prescriptions using hypothetical vignettes. Methods Australian
   community pharmacists were invited through email and social media to
   undertake a web-based questionnaire consisting of nine case vignettes of
   dental prescriptions and their indicated uses in dental settings and two
   perception-based questions. The results were provided as a percentage of
   the correct answers to the case vignettes. In addition, Pearson
   chi-square tests were performed to examine associations between
   categorical variables. Key findings Of the 202 pharmacists who completed
   the questionnaire, the mean number of correct responses was 5 +/- 2 (out
   of 9). More than three-quarters (78.5\%) of pharmacists believed that
   thorough knowledge of prescriptions for dental ailments was necessary
   for safe and effective community pharmacy practice. In addition, nearly
   two-thirds (64.1\%) felt confident that they could dispense medicines
   indicated for dental conditions safely and effectively. Conclusions The
   knowledge demonstrated by participants through correct identification of
   the indications for dental prescription was less than optimal.
   Professional development courses for pharmacists in dental ailments
   could prove beneficial.},

   direction of the forthcoming epidemic situation in India for all policy
   makers. The outburst of the new fatal strain of coronavirus from an
   animal-to-human fall over in China has infected at least 204 countries
   as well as territories throughout the world. As of April 03, 2020,
   almost 972,303 confirmed cases and 50,321 deaths have been reported
   across the world due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
   (SARS-CoV-2) that attained a huge elevation to 19.3 x 10(6) confirmed
   cases on August 08, 2020, of which India contributes a major part of
   2.09 x 10(6) confirmed cases. It is the first neoliberal virus that
   easily encompasses its danger chiefly to easily susceptible including
   the malnutrition, the ill, and old people. As the world struggles with
   pandemic, India with its second largest population of more than 1.3
   billion people in the world is likely to have many more cases than the
   numbers currently being reported. This has put numerous thousand
   individuals under observation in the country due to clinical symptoms,
   recent travel to China, Italy, Iran, and concordant entries in the
   relevant tailing surveys. The novelty of this approach is to rely on the

Abstract = {Objective: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a serious
   public health threat and spread rapidly between healthcare facilities
   (HCFs) during interfacility patient movement. We examined patterns of
   transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions
   during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort
   study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social
   network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility
   patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method
   (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns
   of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and
   local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each
   healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis
   was applied to test the association between network measures and
   facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268
   healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals
   (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of
   New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters,
   yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad.
   The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate
   ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that
   of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with
   another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence
   rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a
   given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased
   surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are
   warranted.},

Abstract = {Purpose For severely mentally ill (SMI) users, continuity of care
   requires consistency between the supports provided by the members of
   their social support network. However, we know little about their
   network cohesion and its association with continuity of care. We set out
   to investigate this association and hypothesised that it would depend on
   the severity of the user's situation and on his/her living arrangements.
   Methods We conducted face-to-face interviews with 380 SMI users
   recruited in outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three
   areas in Belgium. Data regarding users' social networks were collected
   using an ego-network mapping technique and analysed with social network
   analysis. The cohesion indicators were density (frequency of connections
   between network members), centralisation (having a small number of
   central people), and egobetweenness (the user's centrality in his/her
   own network). Participants' perception of continuity of care was
   measured by the Alberta Continuity of Services Scale.
   Results Results show that cohesion indicators were associated with
   continuity of care only for users with high-severity problems,
   regardless of their living arrangements. The numbers of network members,
   professionals, and services in the network were all negatively
   associated with continuity of care for all the users.
   Conclusions Satisfactory continuity of care requires fewer professionals
   or services in a user's network and a dense network for users with the
   most severe problems. This implies that those providing care must not
   only be able to increase cohesion within a network, but also to adapt
   their interventions to support the transition to a different,
   individualised network structure when severity decreases.},

Title = {Superusers' Engagement in Asthma Online Communities: Asynchronous
   Web-Based Interview Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background: Superusers, defined as the 1\% of users who write a large
   number of posts, play critical roles in online health communities
   (OHCs), catalyzing engagement and influencing other users' self-care.
   Their unique online behavior is key to sustaining activity in OHCs and
   making them flourish. Our previous work showed the presence of 20 to 30
   superusers active on a weekly basis among 3345 users in the nationwide
   Asthma UK OHC and that the community would disintegrate if superusers
   were removed. Recruiting these highly skilled individuals for research
   purposes can be challenging, and little is known about supemsers.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore superusers' motivation to
   actively engage in OHCs, the difficulties they may face, and their
   interactions with health care professionals (HCPs).
   Methods: An asynchronous web-based structured interview study was
   conducted. Superusers of the Asthma UK OHC and Facebook groups were
   recruited through Asthma UK staff to pilot and subsequently complete the
   questionnaire Open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: There were 17 superusers recruited for the study (14 patients
   with asthma and 3 carers); the majority were female (15/17). The age
   range of participants was 18 to 75 years. They were active in OHCs for 1
   to 6 years and spent between 1 and 20 hours per week reading and 1 and 3
   hours per week writing posts. Superusers' participation in OHCs was
   prompted by curiosity about asthma and its medical treatment and by the
   availability of spare time when they were off work due to asthma
   exacerbations or retired. Their engagement increased over time as
   participants furthered their familiarity with the OHCs and their
   knowledge of asthma and its self-management. Financial or social
   recognition of the superuser role was not important; their reward came
   from helping and interacting with others. According to the replies
   provided, they showed careful judgment to distinguish what can be dealt
   with through peer advice and what needs input from HCPs. Difficulties
   were encountered when dealing with misunderstandings about asthma and
   its treatment, patients not seeking advice from HCPs when needed, and
   miracle cures or dangerous ideas. Out of 17 participants, only 3 stated
   that their HCPs were aware of their engagement with OHCs. All superusers
   thought that HCPs should direct patients to OHCs, provided they are
   trusted and moderated. In addition, 9 users felt that HCPs themselves
   should take part in OHCs.
   Conclusions: Superusers from a UK-wide online community are highly
   motivated, altruistic, and mostly female individuals who exhibit
   judgment about the complexity of coping with asthma and the limits of
   their advice. Engagement with OHCs satisfies their psychosocial needs.
   Future research should explore how to address their unmet needs, their
   interactions with HCPs, and the potential integration of OHCs in
   traditional healthcare.},

Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Epistaxis is an acute episode of nasal bleeding commonly
   caused in children by traumatic injuries in a school setting. It is one
   of the common ear, nose, and throat emergencies, which should be managed
   with first-aid measures. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have
   been conducted among school teachers in the Qassim region of Saudi
   Arabia regarding this information. This study thus aimed to assess
   levels of knowledge about first-aid management and control of epistaxis
   among school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia.Materials and
   methods: A cross-sectional study using a validated online questionnaire
   was distributed via social media platforms. Information was collected
   regarding sociodemographic characteristics, and eight items assessed
   participants' knowledge about epistaxis and its management. Univariate,
   bivariate, and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess the
   factors associated with good levels of knowledge.Results: The study had
   a total of 1,152 participants, of which 69.7\% were female. The mean of
   knowledge was 3.29 (SD=1.39, range: 0-7). Only 19.4\% of participants
   had a good level of knowledge. In multivariate analysis, females and
   those who had received information on first aid to stop nose-bleeds were
   significantly associated with good knowledge levels (adjusted odds ratio
   \{AOR\}: 1.72, 95\% CI: 1.18-2.51, p=0.005; and AOR: 3.38, 95\% CI:
   2.47-4.64, p<0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Less than one-quarter of
   participants had good knowledge levels. Health education sessions for
   teachers are highly recommended and should specifically target male
   teachers.},

Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Study design Online survey distributed to healthcare professionals
   (HCPs) involved in care of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with
   neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). Objectives Identify
   and bring awareness to the variation of neurogenic bladder management in
   around the world. Setting International online questionnaire. Methods A
   32-question survey was drafted and circulated among a global network of
   SCI experts for review. The survey was disseminated to healthcare
   professionals involved in the care of NLUTD in SCI patients via social
   media, grassroots methods, and international societies. The survey was
   available for 6 weeks and respondents answered questions regarding SCI
   population demographics, access to care, common neurogenic bladder
   management, diagnostic and imaging methods, complications, and follow
   up. Results A total of 296 healthcare professionals, 132 from North
   America, 87 from Europe, 27 from Asia, 24 from Australia, 14 from South
   America, and 6 from Africa, responded to the survey. Global concurrence
   was noted among management method for patients without adequate hand
   function, first-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity, and
   common complications. Continents highly differed in responses regarding
   management method for patients with adequate hand function, frequency of
   patients reusing catheters, timing of urodynamics, and duration of
   antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections. Conclusions The results
   of this international survey demonstrate the variability and uniqueness
   in neurogenic bladder management in SCI patients around the world.
   Increased international discourse and education will improve global
   communication and transparency with the efforts of reducing
   discrepancies in care.},

Abstract = {Introduction-Offshore sailing yields injury risk. Unfortunately, many
   studies are restricted to a specific geographic location, regatta, or
   class of sailboat or to only professional sailors. Therefore, the
   primary aim of this study was to gather a large database of
   sailing-related injuries with demographic, injury, and voyage
   characteristics. Methods-An observational study of self-reported
   offshore sailing-related injuries was performed using an internet-based,
   multiple-choice survey distributed on social media. Data were analyzed
   statistically with the use of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U
   test, and chi 2 test. Results-Five hundred sixty-eight people completed
   the survey, 217 women and 351 men, with a mean age of 36.26 y (SD=13.69
   y). Among reported 793 cruises, 141 resulted in injury (18\%). The most
   frequent injury types were contusion (40\%) and skin lesions and
   lacerations (20\%); the most frequent locations were hand (28\%) and
   foot and ankle (18\%), and the most frequent mechanisms were
   tripping/falling (33\%), being hit by an object (19\%), and using ropes
   (19\%). Sex, age, and sailing experience were not injury risk factors,
   while higher number of offshore days was (P=0.0004). None of the
   analyzed voyage characteristics (purpose, ship's class, position on the
   ship, ship's length overall, type of rigging, and harness wearing) were
   injury risk factors. Sailors perceived the following as risk factors:
   inattention/distraction (34\%), difficult weather conditions (22\%), and
   fatigue/lack of sleep (14\%). Conclusions-Approximately 1 in 5 cruises
   resulted in an injury, occurring regardless of demographic, injury, and
   voyage characteristics. The multifactorial nature of injuries poses a
   challenge in implementing safety measures. The authors hope that this
   study may aid in that cause.},

Journal = {NUTRITION \& DIETETICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4},
Pages = {413-424},
Month = {2023 SEP},
Abstract = {AimsThere is a high prevalence of South Asian immigrants in Australia
   living with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the dietary management of the
   condition presenting as a key challenge. However, their current dietary
   patterns and barriers to diabetes self-management are unclear.
   Therefore, this study aims to (i) investigate current dietary patterns
   and (ii) explore barriers and facilitators to dietary management in this
   population.MethodsA concurrent mixed-methods study comprising three 24-h
   dietary recalls and a semi-structured interview for each self-identified
   South Asian immigrant adult with diabetes recruited across Victorian
   primary care clinics and social media to address the aforementioned two
   aims. Dietary recall data were converted into food groups using
   Foodworks, and data analysed in SPSS. Qualitative data were thematically
   analysed using NVivo.ResultsAmong 18 participants recruited, 14, 16 and
   17 participants had grain, fruit and dairy intake lower than daily
   Australian recommendations, respectively. These findings echoed
   qualitative data that participants viewed diabetes management as
   reducing carbohydrate intake. Participants reported difficulties
   incorporating diabetes-related dietary and lifestyle recommendations
   into their routine and a lack of knowledge about available
   organisational support. They mentioned challenges in receiving social
   support from families and friends and relied on support from health
   professionals. Facilitators included proficiency in nutrition
   information label reading and self-blood glucose monitoring
   skills.ConclusionEnhancing the accessibility to organisational support,
   facilitating the adaption of dietary recommendations into individuals'
   routines, and strengthening support from health professionals are
   essential components in intervention development to improve diabetes
   management for South Asians.},

Title = {Analysis of mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in
   online health forums: a natural language processing study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data
   on population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language
   processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and
   physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online
   health forum users. Setting and design We obtained data from three
   leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked,
   from the period 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed
   the content of posts related to COVID-19. Primary outcome measures (1)
   Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords; (2) proportion
   of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19; (3)
   proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to
   physical and mental health comorbidities. Results Data from 739 434
   posts created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A total of 35 581
   posts (4.8\%) contained a COVID-19 keyword. Posts discussing COVID-19
   and related comorbid disorders spiked in early March to mid-March around
   the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number
   of users to post on online health forums for the first time. Over a
   quarter of COVID-19-related thread titles mentioned a physical or mental
   health comorbidity. Conclusions We demonstrate that it is feasible to
   characterise the content of online health forum user posts regarding
   COVID-19 and measure changes over time. The pandemic and corresponding
   public response has had a significant impact on posters' queries
   regarding mental health. Social media data sources such as online health
   forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health
   surveillance.},

Abstract = {A naive researcher published a scientific article in a respectable
   journal. She thought her article was straightforward and defensible. It
   used only publicly available data, and her findings were consistent with
   much of the literature on the topic. Her coauthors included two
   distinguished statisticians. To her surprise her publication was met
   with unusual attacks from some unexpected sources within the research
   community. These attacks were by and large not pursued through normal
   channels of scientific discussion. Her research became the target of an
   aggressive campaign that included insults, errors, misinformation,
   social media posts, behind-the-scenes gossip and maneuvers, and
   complaints to her employer. The goal appeared to be to undermine and
   discredit her work. The controversy was something deliberately
   manufactured, and the attacks primarily consisted of repeated assertions
   of preconceived opinions. She learned first-hand the antagonism that
   could be provoked by inconvenient scientific findings. Guidelines and
   recommendations should be based on objective and unbiased data.
   Development of public health policy and clinical recommendations is
   complex and needs to be evidence-based rather than belief-based. This
   can be challenging when a hot-button topic is involved. (c) 2021 The

Title = {Assessing the Perceptions and Practices Toward Eye Injuries First Aid
   Among General Population in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia: A
   Cross-Sectional Study},

Abstract = {Aim The eye is a vital and extraordinarily perceptive part of the human
   body. A wide spectrum of possible outcomes from eye injuries, from
   temporary vision loss to permanent blindness. There is a lack of
   information about how to handle an eye injury. Education and raising
   awareness are the best way to prevent severe complications and eventual
   loss of vision. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and
   assess general population knowledge and first aid practices regarding
   eye injuries in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia, focusing on the
   importance of early management. Methodology A cross-sectional
   questionnaire was administered among residents of western Saudi Arabia
   using a validated questionnaire. One thousand two hundred seventy-nine
   adults of both genders were randomly chosen to represent the sample. In
   December 2022, we used a web-based survey to gather our data. Result
   This study analyzed data from 1279 responses on the online platform.
   Results showed that good knowledge was significantly higher among
   females than males, those without a history of eye injury than their
   peers with injuries, and those with higher educational levels than those
   with lower educational levels. Additionally, good knowledge was
   predicted by the female gender (OR = 1.6, 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.1, p <
   0.001). Conclusion The study found that public awareness of eye injury
   first aid was good in the western region. The role of physicians should
   be expanded and health education campaigns and social media are
   recommended to achieve the goal of reduction and limiting the most
   crucial damage to the most sensitive organ in the body.},

Abstract = {Objective To investigate the impact of musculoskeletal (MSK)-related
   symptoms on the quality of life of patients with multiple endocrine
   neoplasia Type 2b (MEN2B). Design An online survey was distributed by
   the Association for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Disorders (AMEND) to
   their members and worldwide via a social media group for MEN2B patients.
   Methods The survey consisted of a detailed questionnaire analysing the
   MSK-related symptoms and structural deformities of MEN2B patients and
   their impact on patient's lives. Participants Forty-eight participants
   completed the survey. Results Participants reported several
   musculoskeletal complaints; the most prevalent being musculoskeletal
   weakness at 73\% (n = 35) and pain 58\% (n = 28). The median pain score
   was 7 (interquartile range {[}IQR]: 5-8) and the frequency of pain was
   daily in 44\% (n = 15) and constant in 21\% (n = 7). Structural
   complaints were common with 63\% (n = 30) stating their physique was
   `different' and 40\% (n = 19) describing marfanoid body features. Spinal
   curvature and foot deformities were the commonest structural
   abnormalities with scoliosis 70\% (n = 16) and pes cavus 63\% (n = 22)
   prevailing. Dental problems were mentioned by 69\% (n = 33) with
   interdental spacing being the most common complaint at 61\% (n = 20).
   The musculoskeletal symptoms of MEN2B had a median impact of 6 (IQR:
   3-9) on quality of life (QOL) with structural deformities 53\% (n = 18)
   and pain 26\% (n = 9) listed as having the highest impact. Poor MSK
   health affected exercise, work and mobility. Conclusions We report a
   high prevalence of musculoskeletal-related complaints in MEN2B which
   significantly affects QOL. This suggests a need to provide better
   holistic care including a multidisciplinary team with physiotherapist,
   orthopaedic and dental specialist input.},

Abstract = {Background. Eating disorders (EDs) seem to be a serious health problem
   in contemporary Polish society. Family Physicians (FPs) have a vital and
   pivotal role to play in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management
   of EDs.
   Objectives. To determine the prevalence of EDs among students in Lodz -
   one of the biggest university centers in Poland; the main causes and
   triggers of EDs and the role of an FP.
   Material and methods. A voluntary anonymous questionnaire concerning ED
   prevalence, attitude to ED treatment and potential risk factors,
   including family relations, was distributed on facebook.com via private
   groups dedicated only to students from leading universities in Lodz
   (Poland). 651 answers from students 18-46 year of age were collected.
   The data was analyzed mainly using the chi-square test with Yates
   correction.
   Results. The research revealed: overall ED prevalence 7.4\%; EDs in
   females 9.5\% and 2.5\% in males (p = 0.003). ED students more often
   indicated an unhealthy parent-child relationship as a risk factor (p <
   0.001). 49\% of students thought that an FP could help with EDs.
   Conclusions. Family dysfunction, peer opinions and the influence of
   social media are major factors and triggers leading to EDs. FPs could
   play an important role, as they are well situated among other health
   professionals, are highly approachable by the local population and may
   have a unique insight into a patient's condition. Further education and
   training of FPs and the revision of appropriate guidelines for the
   management of patients with EDs are essential.},

Journal = {JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Many clinical trials supporting new drug applications
   underrepresent minority patients. Trials conducted by the National
   Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial's Network (NCTN) have greater
   outreach to community sites, potentially allowing better representation.
   We compared the representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical
   company-sponsored cancer clinical trials with NCTN trials and with the
   US cancer population. Methods: We established a large cohort of study
   publications representing the results of trials that supported new US
   Food and Drug Administration drug approvals from 2008 to 2018. NCTN
   trial data were from the SWOG Cancer Research Network. US cancer
   population rates were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results survey data. We compared the proportion of Black patients by
   enrollment year for each cancer type and overall. Tests of proportions
   were used. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: A total 358
   trials (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 85; SWOG trials, 273)
   comprised of 93 825 patients (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials,
   46 313; SWOG trials, 47 512) for 15 cancer types were analyzed. Overall,
   the proportion of Black patients was 2.9\% for pharmaceutical
   company-sponsored trials, 9.0\% for SWOG trials, and 12.1\% for the US
   cancer population (P<.001 for each pairwise comparison). These findings
   were generally consistent across individual cancer types. Conclusions:
   The poor representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical
   company-sponsored trials supporting new drug applications could result
   in the use of new drugs with little data about efficacy or side effects
   in this key population. Moreover, because pharmaceutical
   company-sponsored trials test the newest available therapies, limited
   access to these trials represents a disparity in access to potential
   breakthrough therapies.},

   coronary artery disease: rationale and design of a randomised controlled
   clinical trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Introduction Resistance training (RT) combined with aerobic training
   (AT) enhances the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients
   with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it remains to be
   investigated which type of RT (high loads (HLs) vs low loads (LLs)) is
   more efficacious in improving exercise performance, cardio-metabolic
   health and quality of life.
   Methods and analysis A randomised, controlled, clinical trial will enrol
   20 patients with CAD into each of three study arms (total 60 patients):
   HL-RT (70\%-80\% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)) combined with AT;
   LL-RT (30\%-40\% of 1-RM) combined with AT and AT alone as standard
   care. Primary outcomes (maximal aerobic capacity, maximal leg isometric
   strength) will be assessed at baseline and after 36 training sessions.
   Other outcomes will include acute haemodynamic responses to LL-RT and
   HL-RT, body composition, physical performance, blood biomarkers (lipids,
   glucose metabolism, inflammation, growth factors), physical activity and
   quality of life. The intention-to-treat principle will be used to
   analyse the data.
   Ethics and dissemination The study design and protocol have been
   approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia
   (registration number: 0120573/2019/15). The study will be conducted in
   accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results of the study
   will be published as peer-reviewed manuscripts and congress
   presentations, communicated with patients and the clinical community,
   and shared through posts on social media. The findings of the study will
   be disseminated among the national CR clinical community (CR centres,
   Slovenian association of coronary clubs) with active participation of
   the patients enrolled in the study. This study will expand our knowledge
   of RT in combination with AT in CR. We expect to find different effects
   of HL-RT versus LL-RT, with implications for RT strategies in
   rehabilitation of patients with CAD.},

Title = {Predictors of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility: insights from
   population-based self-reported survey during lockdown in the United
   States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {508-514},
Month = {2022 MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown has highlighted the
   importance of identifying individuals most at risk of infection with
   SARS-CoV-2, underscoring the need to assess factors contributing to
   susceptibility to disease. With the rapidly evolving nature of the
   pandemic and its new variants, there is an inadequate understanding on
   whether there are certain factors such as a specific symptom or
   collection of symptoms that combined with life-style behaviors may be
   useful to predict susceptibility. The study aims to explore such factors
   from pre-vaccination data to guide public health response to potential
   new waves. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was distributed
   through social media during the lockdown period in the United States
   from April to June 2020. Respondents were questioned regarding COVID
   testing, presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities,
   and confirmation of COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression
   was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 perceived susceptibility.
   Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using area
   under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. Results:
   A total of 130 participants deemed as susceptible because they
   self-reported their perception of having COVID-19 (but without the
   evidence of positive test) were compared with 130 individuals with
   documented negative test results. Participants had a mean age of 45
   years, and 165 (63\%) were female. Final multivariable model showed
   significant associations with perceived susceptibility for the following
   variables: fever (OR:33.5; 95\%CI: 3.9,85.9), body ache (OR:3.0;
   95\%CI:1.1,6.4), contact history (OR:2.7; 95\%CI:1.1,6.4), age > 50
   (OR:2.7; 95\%CI:1.1, 6.6) and smoking (OR:3.3; 95\%CI: 1.2,9.1) after
   adjusting for other symptoms and presence of comorbid conditions. The
   AUROC ranged from poor to fair (0.65-0.76) for cluster of symptoms but
   improved to a good model (AUROC = 0.803) after inclusion of
   sociodemographic and lifestyle behaviors e.g., age and smoking tobacco.
   Conclusions: Fever and body aches suggest association with perceived
   COVID-19 susceptibility in the presence of demographic and lifestyle
   behaviors. Using other constitutional and respiratory symptoms with
   fever and body aches, the parsimonious classifier correctly predicts
   80.3\% of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. A larger cohort of
   respondents will be needed to study and refine classifier performance in
   future lockdowns and with expected surge of new variants of COVID-19
   pandemic. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent
   functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diet may play a role in triggering
   the symptoms. We aimed to measure the prevalence of IBS and its types,
   and its association with food restrictions among the Saudi population,
   using the Rome IV criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was
   conducted in the outpatient clinics of three major hospitals in Riyadh
   in conjunction with an electronic survey which was shared on social
   media. A total of 1,319 subjects (706 males and 613 females) completed a
   questionnaire of four domains (sociodemography, Rome IV, food
   restriction, and herbs) between Nov 2019 and February 2020. Convenience
   sampling was used.Results: IBS was diagnosed in 104 subjects (7.9\%)
   and, of these, 52\% were IBS-M (mixed) type. The prevalence was higher
   in women than in men (4.9\% vs. 3.0\%; P = 0.006). A significant
   association was found between the presence of IBS symptoms and low
   income (P = 0.010), and not working (P < 0.0001). Most of the IBS
   patients showed food restriction related to milk (P < 0.0001) and
   legumes (P = 0.0029), besides other types of food and drinks.
   Conclusions: IBS is less common among the Saudi population. A female
   gender, low family income, and working status, have the highest
   association with IBS. The foods most often restricted were legumes and
   milk. Future community studies may present an opportunity to relate with
   cultural differences and food preferences.},

Title = {Global approaches to cardiogenetic evaluation after sudden cardiac death
   in the young: A survey among health care professionals},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Thorough investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those
   aged 1-40 years commonly reveals a heritable cause, yet access to
   postmortem genetic testing is variable.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore practices of
   postmortem genetic testing and attitudes of health care professionals
   worldwide.
   METHODS A survey was administered among health care professionals
   recruited through professional associations, social media, and networks
   of researchers. Topics included practices around postmortem genetic
   testing, level of confidence in health care professionals' ability, and
   attitudes toward postmortem genetic testing practices.
   RESULTS There were 112 respondents, with 93\% from North America,
   Europe, and Australia/New Zealand, and 7\% from South America, Asia and
   Africa. Only 30\% reported autopsy as mandatory, and overall practices
   were largely case by case and not standardized. North American
   respondents (87\%) more often perceived practices as ineffective
   compared to those from Europe (58\%) and Australia/ New Zealand (48\%; P
   = .002). Where a heritable cause is suspected, 69\% considered
   postmortem genetic testing and 61\% offered genetic counseling to
   surviving family members. Financial resources varied widely. Half of
   participants believed practices in their countries perpetuated health
   inequalities.
   CONCLUSION Postmortem genetic testing is not consistently available in
   the investigation of young SCD despite being a recommendation in
   international guidelines. Access to postmortem genetic testing, which is
   critical in ascertaining a cause of death in many cases, must be guided
   by well-resourced, multidisciplinary teams.},

Abstract = {Objective: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) have been significant among elderly residents of residential
   aged-care services (RACS). To prevent incursions of COVID-19 in RACS in
   Australia, visitors were banned and aged-care workers were encouraged to
   work at a single site. We conducted a review of case notes and a social
   network analysis to understand how workplace and social networks enabled
   the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   among RACS. Design: Retrospective outbreak review. Setting and
   participants: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria,
   Australia, May-October 2020. Methods: The Victorian Department of Health
   COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social
   networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a
   household network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index
   cases were reviewed to estimate the number and size (number of resident
   cases and deaths) of outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus
   transmission via households. Results: Among 2,033 cases linked to an
   outbreak as staff, 91 (4.5\%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three
   outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed
   potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In addition,
   99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak through their
   household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were attributed to staff-household
   transmission. Conclusions: Limiting worker mobility through single-site
   policies could reduce the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS
   to another. However, initiatives that reduce the chance of transmission
   via household networks would also be needed.},

   Methods. The CPG for antibiotic treatment of community-acquired

   2016. The CPG was introduced by multifaceted interventions, including
   posters, brochures, circular letters, social media, conference,
   classroom training, and interactive education during January to
   September 2018.
   Results. Among 360 patients with community-acquired cellulitis, 84.4\%
   were ambulatory and 15.6\% were hospitalized. The median age of patients
   was 62 years, and 59.4\% were female. Antibiotic prescription according
   to CPG (CPG-compliant group) was observed in 251 patients (69.7\%), and
   CPG noncompliance was found in 109 patients (30.3\%) (CPG-noncompliant
   group). The demographics and characteristics of patients were comparable
   between groups. Patients in the CPG-compliant group had a significantly
   lower rate of intravenous antibiotics (18.7\% vs 33.9\%, P = .007),
   lower prescription rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics (14.7\% vs 78.9\%,
   P < .001) and antibiotic combination (6.4\% vs 13.8\%, P = .022),
   shorter median duration of antibiotic treatment (7 vs 10 days, P <
   .001), lower median cost of antibiotic treatment (US \$3 vs \$7, P <
   .001), and lower median hospitalization cost (US \$601 vs \$1587, P =
   .008) than those in the CPG-noncompliant group. Treatment outcomes were
   not significantly different between groups.
   Conclusions. Adherence to CPG seems to reduce inappropriate prescription
   of broad-spectrum antibiotic or antibiotic combination and treatment
   costs in adults with community-acquired cellulitis without differences
   in favorable outcomes or adverse events.},

Abstract = {BackgroundGlobally transgender women (TW) are at heightened
   vulnerability for HIV infection. In Lima Peru, sharp increases in HIV
   prevalence are seen among TW ages 25 years and older highlighting the
   need for early HIV prevention efforts for young TW. This study conducted
   in-depth qualitative interviews to elucidate the social and
   developmental contexts of HIV vulnerability for young TW in Lima
   Peru.MethodsBetween November 2019 and February 2020, young TW ages 16-24
   years (n = 21) in Lima Peru were purposively sampled using in-person
   (e.g., face-to-face outreach) and online (e.g., social media, networking
   websites) social network-based methods. Interviews were conducted in
   Spanish and a rapid qualitative analysis was conducted using a modified
   immersion crystallization methodology to identify themes.ResultsFive
   themes emerged, informing the conceptualization of a Life Course Health
   Development Model of HIV Vulnerabilities and Resiliencies: (1)
   interpersonal contexts (family, school, partners, sexual debut, trans
   mothers); (2) structural vulnerabilities (poverty, educational
   constraints, migration, hostile environments, sex work, police
   violence); (3) concomitant mental health and psychosocial factors
   (discrimination, violence, depression, suicidality, substance use, life
   hopes/dreams/future expectations); (4) gender affirmation processes
   (gender identity development, hormones, surgery, legal name/gender
   marker change); (5) HIV prevention and treatment barriers (PrEP uptake,
   HIV care, condom use, risk reduction).ConclusionsYoung TW experience
   formidable developmental challenges associated with transphobia,
   violence, and pre-maturely facing accelerated milestones.
   Developmentally and culturally appropriate interventions to mitigate HIV
   vulnerability in Peru are needed, including those that consider
   co-occurring stigma-related conditions in adolescence and young
   adulthood.},

Abstract = {Background and aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic
   functional bowel disorder. Many adults worldwide have symptoms
   associated with IBS and are responsible for most gastroenterology
   visits. The aim of this study is to illustrate and analyze the
   prevalence of IBS among the general population in Makkah Al-Mukarramah
   city using the Rome IV criteria in relation to psychiatric
   disorders.Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on
   Makkah citizens. The study excluded all residents in Makkah without
   Saudi nationality or below the age of 18. The survey was created using
   Google forms and shared randomly on social media. The sample size was
   calculated using the OpenEpi website v3.0. The online questionnaire is
   composed of three sections: sociodemographic data, Rome IV criteria with
   the Bristol Stool Scale, and lastly the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
   Scale 21 (DASS-21) score for stress, anxiety, and depression. Data were
   analyzed using SPSS software for Windows V.23, and odds ratio (OR) with
   95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) was obtained for selected risk
   factors using logistic regression.Results: Nine hundred and twenty-one
   individuals from Makkah city completed the survey. The overall IBS
   prevalence was 20.19\%. The commonest subtypes of IBS were IBS-M
   followed by IBS-C (53.8\% and 22\%, respectively). In the multiple
   regression analysis, stress (P = <0.001, OR = 2.473) was statistically
   significantly associated with IBS.Conclusion: In this study, the
   prevalence of IBS among Makkah citizens is high. Stress was found to be
   a major risk factor for IBS.},

Abstract = {In January 2016, the first case of mosquito-borne Zika infection in the
   mainland United States was confirmed in Miami, Florida. The first
   locally acquired case was reported 6 months later. Local public health
   and school officials began warning students of the outbreak on their
   return to the classroom in August 2016. In November-December 2016, we
   conducted a survey of students attending a large public university in
   Miami to determine how well informed they were about Zika. A multistage
   sampling design was used to contact teaching assistants and ask them for
   help in recruiting their students. Eligible students had to be 18 years
   of age or older and enrolled in at least one three-credit course during
   fall semester. A 25-item questionnaire based on the World Health
   Organization Zika Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice Resource Pack was
   developed, pretested, and approved by the university's institutional
   review board before it was made available to eligible students through
   Blackboard Learn or a survey link. About half (50.4\%) of the 139
   respondents had heard about Zika prior to 2016. Only one student was
   unaware of Zika before our survey. Most (47.1\%) first learned about
   Zika through television, 18.8\% from family or friends, and 15.2\% from
   the Internet, social media, or university e-mail. Two thirds (66.2\%)
   believed Zika could be prevented, 15.1\% thought it might be prevented,
   and 85.7\% had taken some precautions. A high level of awareness of the
   risk of Zika infection was apparent. Most students reported taking steps
   to avoid exposure to the Zika virus.},

Abstract = {Introduction Sri Lanka has a long history of armed conflict and natural
   disasters increasing the risk of mental health disorders in the
   population. Due to a lack of specialist services, there is a treatment
   gap between those seeking and those able to access mental health
   services. The aim of this research programme is to integrate mental
   health services into primary care to meet the needs of this postconflict
   population.
   Methods and analysis This is a stepped wedge cluster design randomised
   clinical trial of the WHO mental health Gap Action Programme primary
   care mental health training intervention. We will provide a 10-day
   training to primary care practitioners of 23 randomly selected primary
   care facilities aimed at increasing their ability to identify, treat and
   manage common mental health disorders. Public health professionals and
   community representatives will receive a tailored training intervention
   to increase mental health awareness. Refresher courses will occur at 3
   and 6 months post training. Supervision and monitoring will occur for 1
   month pre and post training. Target sample sizes have been calculated
   separately for each group of participants and for each outcome.
   Ethics and dissemination This trial has received ethical approval from
   the Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia
   Ruskin University, UK (SC/jc/ FMFREP/16/17 076) and from the Faculty of
   Medicine, University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka (J/ERC/17/81/NDR/0170) and
   non-engagement approval has been received from the funding body, the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018-015). All participants
   gave written consent. Dissemination of study results will be completed
   through publication of academic articles, conference presentations, town
   hall meetings, written pamphlets in plain language, reports to Ministry
   of Health and other government organisations and through social media
   outlets.},

Title = {Community perspectives on spinal cord injury in rugby union: facts and
   fears},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN FOOTBALL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 2},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe sport of rugby union, henceforth rugby, is associated
   with a risk of spinal cord injury (SCI). Perceived risks can impact
   participation. Understanding community perspectives on rugby-related SCI
   may provide insight for addressing concerns around risk. The aim of this
   study was to explore community perspectives through social media
   discussion about SCI in rugby union.MethodsPosts about SCI in rugby
   union were identified using the advanced search function on Twitter.
   Data (content as original post, retweet, quote tweet and comments) were
   included if focused on Rugby Union and written in English. Inclusion
   dates (July 2018 to June 2019) were chosen to capture a period when
   several SCI (n = 4) occurred in community rugby in Australia. Data were
   analysed using a thematic approach.ResultsFour themes were derived from
   the collected data. The `pendulum swing' relates to the disparate views
   of rugby, from being overly cautious to too dangerous to play. The `role
   of rugby culture' described engrained behaviours and attitudes on and
   off-field toward safety. `Media influence' describes the emotive
   narrative used when reporting rugby-related SCI. `After the injury'
   looks at expressions of sympathy and inspiration. These findings showed
   how individuals' views of SCI were influenced through rugby culture,
   trust in governing bodies and the news media.ConclusionBy `listening in'
   to community views, their most pertinent safety concerns can be
   addressed. Both facts and fears on rugby-related SCI were evident, and
   these extreme views can be balanced with evidence-based education and
   sensible risk management.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine concussion history, knowledge, and attitudes among
   Irish professional and amateur jockeys. Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Questionnaire was distributed through e-mails sent to all
   licensed jockeys, over social media and during professional and amateur
   race meetings. Participants: An average of 23.6\% (12\%-44\%) Irish
   professional and amateur jockeys (n = 119) holding a license in 2017.
   Main Outcome Measures: Jockeys reported their previous concussion
   history, actions after their most recent concussion and responded to
   questions examining their knowledge and attitudes toward concussion.
   Results: Amateur (32.4\%) and professional (19.6\%) jockeys, who were
   never medically diagnosed over their career, suspected that they had
   sustained a concussion. Jockeys displayed good knowledge of concussion
   signs and symptoms; yet, one in 2 jockeys would continue to ride out the
   same day if they suspected they had a concussion. They were less likely
   if they had a race that day. Reasons for continuing to ride include not
   considering a concussion as serious (85.7\%); risk of losing the ride
   (84.0\%); not wanting to let anyone down (77.8\%); and considered it a
   sign of weakness (74.1\%). Risky behavior was more common after a
   suspected concussion than a medically diagnosed concussion. Conclusions:
   Underreporting of concussions is proposed as a serious concern, and
   concussion understanding and attitudes can impact reporting. To address
   the issue of underreporting of concussions in Irish horseracing, there
   is a need to educate jockeys and the wider racing community on the
   importance of timely concussion assessments and access to appropriate
   management systems.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 a pandemic changed the world. Public health
   directives to socially distance with stay-at-home orders altered injury
   risk factor exposure, resulting injury patterns and conducting injury
   prevention (IP). The objective of this study was to determine the impact
   the COVID-19 pandemic on injury and IP at North American trauma centers
   (TC).ResultsSixty-two responses were received from pediatric (44\%),
   adult (11\%), and combined (31\%) TC, from 22 American states, 5
   Canadian provinces and Australia. The majority (91\%) of programs
   targeted age groups from birth to 15 years old. Nearly one-third
   reported IP to be less of an institutional priority with funding
   redistributed in 15\% of centers {[}median (IQR) - 25\% (- 43, 1)], and
   resultant staffing changes at 38\% of centers. A decrease in IP efforts
   was reported at 64\% of TC. Overall, the majority of respondents
   reviewed injury data, with the top reported increased mechanisms mainly
   intentional: Firearm-related (75\%), assaults (72\%), and abuse (71\%).
   Leading increased unintentional injuries were injuries occurring in the
   home such as falls (70\%), followed by ATV (62\%), and cycling (57\%).
   Sites pivoted by presenting (74\%) or participating (73\%) in IP
   education virtually, social media posts (61\%) and the addition of
   technology (29\%). Top barriers were redeployment of partners (45\%) and
   staff (31\%), as well as lack of technology (40\%) in the target
   population. Facilitators were technology at TC (74\%), support of trauma
   program (63\%), and having IP funding maintained
   (55\%).ConclusionsNearly two-thirds of TC decreased IP efforts during
   the pandemic due to staffing and funding reductions. The leading
   reported increased injuries were intentional, indicating that violence
   prevention is needed, along with support for mental health. While TC
   successfully pivoted by using technology, access issues in the target
   population was a barrier resulting in health inequities.},

Abstract = {This study examined the associations between diabetes and
   self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated
   health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during China's
   nationwide quarantine. The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered
   anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults
   in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74
   items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for
   COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the
   period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among
   study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk
   of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family
   members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks
   had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those
   who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between
   face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes
   tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with
   preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal
   infection (40.0\% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0\% without
   diabetes). Only 54-55\% of these respondents claimed to consistently
   practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60\%
   of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during
   the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without
   diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages
   reported a 63\% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated
   with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member
   COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.},

Title = {Paving the Way for the Implementation of a Decision Support System for
   Antibiotic Prescribing in Primary Care in West Africa: Preimplementation
   and Co-Design Workshop With Physicians},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background: Suboptimal use of antibiotics is a driver of antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR). Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can assist
   prescribers with rapid access to up-to-date information. In low- and
   middle-income countries (LMIC), the introduction of CD SS for antibiotic
   prescribing could have a measurable impact. However, interventions to
   implement them are challenging because of cultural and structural
   constraints, and their adoption and sustainability in routine clinical
   care are often limited. Preimplementation research is needed to ensure
   relevant adaptation and fit within the context of primary care in West
   Africa.
   Objective: This study examined the requirements for a CDSS adapted to
   the context of primary care in West Africa, to analyze the barriers and
   facilitators of its implementation and adaptation, and to ensure
   co-designed solutions for its adaptation and sustainable use.
   Methods: We organized a workshop in Burkina Faso in June 2019 with 47
   health care professionals representing 9 West African countries and 6
   medical specialties. The workshop began with a presentation of
   Antibioclic, a publicly funded CDSS for antibiotic prescribing in
   primary care that provides personalized antibiotic recommendations for
   37 infectious diseases. Antibioclic is freely available on the web and
   as a smartphone app (iOS, Android). The presentation was followed by a
   roundtable discussion and completion of a questionnaire with open-ended
   questions by participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic
   analysis.
   Results: Most of the participants had access to a smartphone during
   their clinical consultations (35/47, 74\%), but only 49\% (23/47) had
   access to a computer and none used CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. The
   participants considered that CDSS could have a number of benefits
   including updating the knowledge of practitioners on antibiotic
   prescribing, improving clinical care and reducing AMR, encouraging the
   establishment of national guidelines, and developing surveillance
   capabilities in primary care. The most frequently mentioned contextual
   barrier to implementing a CD SS was the potential risk of increasing
   self-medication in West Africa, where antibiotics can be bought without
   a prescription. The need for the CDSS to be tailored to the local
   epidemiology of infectious diseases and AMR was highlighted along with
   the availability of diagnostic tests and antibiotics using national
   guidelines where available. Participants endorsed co-design involving
   all stakeholders, including nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, as
   central to any introduction of CDSS. A phased approach was suggested by
   initiating and evaluating CDSS at a pilot site, followed by
   dissemination using professional networks and social media. The lack of
   widespread internet access and computers could be circumvented by a
   mobile app with an offline mode.
   Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information for the development
   and implementation of a CDSS for antibiotic prescribing among primary
   care prescribers in LMICs and may, in turn, contribute to improving
   antibiotic use, clinical outcomes and decreasing AMR.},

Title = {An Alternative to Traditional Bedside Teaching During COVID-19:
   High-Fidelity Simulation-Based Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Bedside teaching is integral to medical education and has
   been highlighted to improve clinical and communication skills, as well
   as clinical reasoning. Despite the significant advantages of bedside
   teaching, its usage within medical education has been declining, and
   COVID-19 has added additional challenges. The pandemic has resulted in a
   significant reduction in opportunities to deliver bedside teaching due
   to risk of viral exposure, patients declining student interactions, and
   ward closures. Educators have therefore been required to be innovative
   in their teaching methods, leading to the use of online learning, social
   media platforms, and simulation. Simulation-based education allows for
   learning in a low-risk environment and affords the opportunity for
   deliberated repeated practice with case standardization. The results
   demonstrate that simulation-based training can increase students'
   confidence, increase the rates of correct clinical diagnoses, and
   improve retention of skills and knowledge when compared with traditional
   teaching methods.
   Objective: To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 upon bedside teaching for
   third year students at Hull York Medical School amid closure of the
   cardiorespiratory wards, a high-fidelity simulation-based model of
   traditional bedside teaching was designed and implemented. The
   objectives of the teaching session were to enable students to perform
   history taking and a focused cardiorespiratory clinical examination in a
   COVID-19-safe environment using SimMan 3G.
   Methods: Four clinical teaching fellows with experience of
   simulation-based medical education scripted histories for 2 common
   cardiorespiratory cases, which were asthma and aortic stenosis. The
   simulation sessions were designed for students to take a focused
   cardiorespiratory history and clinical examination using SimMan 3G. All
   cases involved dynamic vital signs, and the simulator allowed for
   auscultation of an ejection systolic murmur and wheezing in accordance
   with the cases chosen. Key aspects of the pathologies, including
   epidemiology, differential diagnoses, investigations, and management,
   were summarized using an interactive PowerPoint presentation, followed
   by a debriefing session.
   Results: In total, 12 third year medical students undertook the
   sessions, and overall feedback was highly positive. Of the 10 students
   who completed the feedback questionnaires, 90\% (n=9) felt more
   confident in their clinical examination skills following the teaching;
   100\% (n=10) of the students responded that they would recommend the
   session to a colleague; and implementation of regular simulation was
   frequently requested on feedback. These results are in keeping with the
   current literature.
   Conclusions: Bedside teaching continues to face ongoing challenges from
   the COVID-19 pandemic as well as declining patient recruitment and
   fluctuations in clinical findings. The support for simulation-based
   medical education is derived from high-quality studies; however, studies
   describing the use of this technology for bedside teaching in the
   undergraduate curriculum are limited. The authors describe a highly
   effective teaching session amid the pandemic, which allowed for
   maintenance of staff and student safety alongside continued education
   during a challenging time for educators globally.},

Abstract = {Aims and Objectives This study aimed to determine the relationship of
   nurses' psychological well-being with their coronaphobia and work-life
   balance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background COVID-19 is a global
   life-threatening disease. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects
   nurses' mental health. No studies have been conducted to determine the
   factors that affect nurses' psychological well-being during the COVID-19
   pandemic in Turkey. If nurses' psychological well-being is impaired
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of nursing care and the
   nurses' performance may be negatively affected. Design This is a
   descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study. The Strengthening
   the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
   reporting guideline checklist for cross-sectional studies was used for
   reporting in this study. Methods The study population consisted of the
   nurses working in a Health Application and Research Center in Turkey.
   Data were collected using Google forms between June-August 2020. The
   study sample consisted of 295 nurses who voluntarily agreed to
   participate in the study and used social media tools. The data were
   collected using a Sociodemographic Characteristics Form, the COVID-19
   Phobia Scale (C19P-S), the Work-Life Balance (WLB) Scale and the
   Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale. The factors that affect
   psychological well-being were determined using the stepwise multiple
   linear regression analysis. Results The nurses' work-life balance and
   psychological well-being were negatively affected during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Their COVID-19 phobia was mild-to-moderate level. The nurses'
   psychological well-being was significantly affected by the variable of
   neglecting life the most, followed by coronaphobia and work-life
   balance, which explain 75\% of the variance. Conclusions This study
   shows that coronaphobia experienced by nurses and work-life balance was
   related to their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Managers should take measures (regulating the working hours) to decrease
   nurses' COVID-19 phobia (education, counselling or psychotherapy) and
   work-life imbalance. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses' peers,
   managers and organisations need to take into account nurses' negative
   emotions and behaviours and organise training programmes to help them
   overcome their fears, communicate clearly and provide for their basic
   needs. Organisations, including managers and nurses, must recognise the
   distress being experienced by their nurses and create safe environments
   in which to have significant conversations. Nurses' mental health can be
   screened regularly by multidisciplinary teams, psychological support can
   be provided when required, and working hours can be regulated through
   appropriate shifts and breaks that will ensure work-life balance during
   and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses receiving emotional support from
   their families and friends (via chatting and sharing troubles) can also
   contribute positively. These measures and regulations will positively
   affect nurses' psychological well-being and contribute to an increase in
   the quality of care and nurses' performance.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine injury (including concussion) rates, location,
   type, mechanisms, and risk factors in sledge hockey players. Design:
   Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Sledge hockey players, worldwide,
   across all levels of play. Participants: Sledge hockey players (ages >=
   14 years) who played in the 2019 to 2020 season were recruited through
   email, social media, and word of mouth communication. Assessment of Risk
   Factors: Participant characteristics (eg, age, sex, disability) were
   examined as potential injury risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Injury
   rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) examining potential risk
   factors were reported based on univariate Poisson regression analyses.
   Injury proportions by type, location, and mechanism were described.
   Results: Ninety-two players initiated the survey, and 77 (83.7\%)
   provided some injury information. Forty-seven injuries included 16
   concussions in 9 of 77 players (11.7\%) and 31 non-concussion injuries
   in 20 of 77 players (26.0\%) were reported. The overall IR was 13.2
   injuries/1000 athlete-exposures {[}95\% confidence interval (CI);
   9.6-17.6]. The game IR (28.4 injuries/1000 game-exposures, 95\% CI;
   18.6-41.7) was higher than practice IR (4.4 injuries/1000
   practice-exposures, 95\% CI; 2.2-7.9) (IRR = 6.5, 95\% CI; 3.1-14.5).
   The most common injury locations were the head (34.0\%), wrist/hand
   (14.8\%), and shoulder (10.6\%). The most common significant injury
   types were concussion (36.2\%) and bone fracture (8.5\%). Body checking
   was the primary mechanism for injuries caused by contact with another
   player (42.1\%) Age, sex, disability, and level of play were not found
   as injury risk factors. Conclusions: Concussions and upper extremity
   injuries were the most common sledge hockey injuries reported, with body
   checking being the most common mechanism. This research will inform
   development of prevention strategies in sledge hockey.},

Abstract = {Purpose Rooted in a trans-territorial framework, the present study was
   designed to provide new evidence regarding the patterns of communication
   among Hurricane Maria survivors who migrated to the U.S. in the
   aftermath of the storm. Methods A total of 319 Hurricane Maria survivor
   adults ages 18 and older were recruited into the Adelante Boricua study
   between August 2020 and October 2021. Most participants had relocated to
   the U.S. between 2017 and 2018. We used latent profile analysis and
   multinomial regression to examine the relationship of technology-based
   communication with depressive symptoms, well-being, cultural connection,
   and migration stress. Results We identified a five-class solution,
   consisting of (1) moderate communication (32\%), (2) disengaged (24\%),
   (3) no social media (18\%), (4) daily with family in Puerto Rico (6\%),
   and (5) daily trans-territorial (13\%) typologies. Participants in the
   disengaged class were more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms
   and limited English proficiency, lower prosocial behaviors, lower levels
   of religiosity, lower attendance at religious services in the U.S., and
   less engagement in social activities, compared to participants in the
   Moderate Communication class. Conclusion Roughly one in four individuals
   in our sample reported very limited technology-based communication with
   friends/family in their sending and new-receiving communities. As
   technology and smartphones continue to become integrated into
   21st-century life, it is vital that researchers explore how the
   tremendous potential for connectedness relates to trans-territorial
   crisis migrants' well-being and adaptation.},

Abstract = {IntroductionOur community-based participatory research partnership aims
   to expand understanding of the social, ethical and behavioural
   implications of COVID-19 testing and vaccination to inform the
   development of an integrated intervention that harnesses community-based
   peer navigation and mHealth strategies to improve COVID-19 testing and
   vaccination; test the intervention; and develop and disseminate
   practice, research and policy recommendations to further increase
   COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine
   communities in the USA.
   Methods and analysisWe will conduct 50 individual in-depth interviews
   with health providers, who have conducted COVID-19 testing and/or
   vaccination activities within Spanish-speaking communities, and with
   representatives from Latine-serving community-based organisations. We
   will also conduct six focus groups with 8-12 Spanish-speaking Latine
   community member participants each for a total number of about 60 focus
   group participants. Next, we will develop the Nuestra Comunidad
   Saludable intervention based on findings from interviews and focus
   groups and use a longitudinal group-randomised trial design with two
   arms (intervention and delayed intervention) to evaluate the impact of
   the intervention. We will recruit, enrol and collect baseline data from
   20 community-based peer navigators (Navegantes) and their social network
   members (n=8 unique social network members per Navegante). Navegantes
   (coupled with their social networks) will be randomised to intervention
   or delayed intervention groups (10 Navegantes and 80 social network
   members per group).
   Ethics and disseminationEthical approval for data collection was granted
   by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Institutional Review
   Board. Following the description of study procedures, we will obtain
   consent from all study participants. Study findings will be disseminated
   through an empowerment theory-based community forum, peer-reviewed
   publications and presentations at scientific meetings, and reports and
   briefs for lay, community and practitioner audiences.Trial registration

Abstract = {This study aimed to assess the knowledge, practices, and beliefs among
   the Jordanian population regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. A
   cross-sectional questionnaire was designed and used to recruit
   participants from October 5th through December 12(th). Statistical
   analysis was conducted using SPSS. Descriptive statistical analysis was
   used to analyse the sociodemographic data, the Shapiro-Wilk test was
   used to assess the normality, Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the
   reliability of the questionnaire and Point-biserial correlation was used
   to figure out whether there is an association between Score of knowledge
   and the dichotomous variables. A random sample of 432 participated in
   the study. The majority were females (n = 310, 71.8\%), the mean age was
   21 (42.0\%) years,416 (96.3\%) were urban inhabitants and most of them
   (n = 351, 81.3\%) had bachelor's degree. School/university (n = 280,
   64.8\%) were reported as a major source of information followed by
   TV/internet/social media 276 (63.9\%). The total mean (+/- SD) of
   knowledge score regarding HBV infection symptoms, transmission modes and
   treatment was found 12.28 +/- 3.2. Participants' knowledge regarding
   symptoms including nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite was 73
   (16.9\%). More than 80\% had good knowledge regarding the complications
   of HBV infection. Only 100 participant reported vaccination (23.1\%)
   against the virus. Poor knowledge and low vaccination rate against HBV
   were found thus implementing comprehensive educational program for
   people highlighting the importance of vaccination against the virus is
   crucial.},

Abstract = {Including children in biomedical research is an argument for continual
   reflection and practice refinement from an ethical and legal standpoint.
   Indeed, as children reach adulthood, a reconsent method should be used,
   and data connected with samples should ideally be updated based on the
   children's growth and long-term results. Furthermore, because most
   pediatric disorders are uncommon, children's research initiatives should
   conform to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by worldwide
   scientific organizations for successfully sharing data and samples.
   Here, we examine how pediatric biobanks can help address some challenges
   to improve biomedical research for children. Indeed, modern biobanks are
   evolving as complex research platforms with specialized employees,
   dedicated spaces, information technologies services (ITS), and ethical
   and legal expertise. In the case of research for children, biobanks can
   collaborate with scientific networks (i.e., BBMRI-ERIC) and provide the
   collection, storage, and distribution of biosamples in agreement with
   international standard procedures (ISO-20387). Close collaboration among
   biobanks provides shared avenues for maximizing scarce biological
   samples, which is required to promote the translation of scientific
   breakthroughs for developing clinical care and health policies tailored
   to the pediatric population. Moreover, biobanks, through their science
   communication and dissemination activities (i.e., European Biobank
   Week), may be helpful for children to understand what it means to be
   engaged in a research study, allowing them to see it as a pleasant,
   useful, and empowering experience. Additionally, biobanks can notify
   each participant about which projects have been accomplished (i.e.,
   through their websites, social media networks, etc.); they can
   facilitate future reconsent procedures and update sample-associated data
   based on the children's growth. Finally, because of the increasing
   interest from public and commercial organizations in research efforts
   that include the sharing and reuse of health data, pediatric biobanks
   have a crucial role in this context. Consequently, they could benefit
   from funding opportunities for sustaining research activities even
   regarding rare pediatric disorders.Conclusion: Pediatric biobanks are
   helpful for providing biological material for research purposes,
   addressing ethical and legal issues (i.e. data protection, consent,
   etc.), and providing control samples from healthy children of various
   ages and from different geographical regions and ethnicities. Therefore,
   it is vital to encourage and maintain children's engagement in medical
   research programs and biobanking activities, especially as children
   become adults, and reconsent procedures must be applied.},

Title = {Characterization of Chronic Urticaria and Associated Conditions-A
   Web-Based Survey},
Journal = {DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL \& CONCEPTUAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Chronic urticaria is a common disease, characterized by
   the development of wheals, angioedema, or both, which can be associated
   with several comorbidities. Most of the available studies have focused
   on specific common comorbidities and their association with CU, but have
   seldom reported the overall burden of comorbidities.Objectives: This
   study aimed to investigate and analyze self-reported comorbidities in
   Polish patients with CU. Methods: An anonymous online survey consisting
   of 20 questions was conducted on members of an Urticaria group on the
   social media platform Facebook. A total of 102 people took part in this
   survey. The results were analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2016.Results: In
   the group, 95.1\% were females and 4.9\% males, with a mean age of 33.8
   years. The most common diagnosed type of urticaria was spontaneous
   (52.9\%). Angioedema accompanied urticaria in 68.6\% of the respondents,
   mainly those with delayed pressure urticaria (86.4\%). 85.3\% of
   respon-dents reported comorbidities, most often atopic diseases and
   allergies (49\%), chronic inflammation and infections (36.3\%), thyroid
   (36.3\%) and psychiatric disorders (25.5\%). Moreover, in 30.4\% of
   patients, at least one autoimmune disease was noted. As compared to the
   patients without autoim-mune urticaria, many more with autoimmune
   urticaria had a coexisting autoimmune disease (50\% vs. 23.7\%). Family
   history of autoimmune diseases was positive in 42.2\%, and the familial
   history of urticaria and atopy was positive in 7.8\% and 25.5\%,
   respectively.Conclusions: The knowledge of comorbidities of chronic
   urticaria may support clinicians to manage and treat patients with this
   common condition.},

Abstract = {Engaging women with obesity in health-related studies during
   preconception is challenging. Limited data exists relating to their
   participation. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences and
   opinions of women participating in a weight-related, preconception
   trial. This is an explanatory sequential (quan-QUAL) mixed-methods Study
   Within A Trial, embedded in the GetGutsy randomized controlled trial
   (ISRCTN11295995). Screened participants completed an online survey of
   eight questions (single or multiple choice and Likert scale) on
   recruitment, motivations and opinions on study activities. Participants
   with abdominal obesity (waist circumference >= 80 cm) were invited to a
   subsequent semi-structured, online focus group (n = 2, 9 participants)
   that was transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis,
   with a pragmatic epistemological approach. The survey (n = 102) showed
   the main research participation motivations were supporting health
   research (n = 38, 37.3\%) and wanting health screening (n = 30, 29.4\%).
   Most participants were recruited via email (n = 35, 34.7\%) or social
   media (n = 15, 14.7\%). In the FGs, participants valued flexibility,
   convenience and. research methods that aligned with their lifestyles.
   Participants had an expanded view of health that considered emotional
   well-being and balance alongside more traditional medical assessments.
   Clinical trialists should consider well-being, addressing the
   interconnectedness of health and incorporate a variety of research
   activities to engage women of reproductive age with obesity.},

Title = {Preferences of men who have sex with men for performing anal
   self-examination for the detection of anal syphilis in Australia: A
   discrete choice experiment},
Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Month = {2022 APR},
Abstract = {Background Regular anal self-examination could potentially reduce
   syphilis transmission by detecting anal syphilis earlier among men who
   have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to examine the preferences of
   MSM on performing anal self-examination to detect anal syphilis.
   Methods An online survey with a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was
   distributed to MSM attending a sexual health clinic and through social
   media in Australia between June and November 2020. The DCE examined the
   preferred attributes of anal self-examination that would encourage MSM
   to perform anal self-examination. Data were analysed using a random
   parameters logit (RPL) model.
   Findings The median age of 557 MSM who completed the survey was 35
   (inter quartile range, 27-45). The choice to perform anal
   self-examination was most influenced by two attributes: the accuracy of
   anal self-examination to diagnose anal syphilis, and the frequency of
   anal self-examination, followed by the type of instruction materials to
   perform anal self-examination, waiting time for medical review, and type
   of support received if abnormalities were found. Using the most
   preferred attributes, 98\% of people would conduct anal self-examination
   compared with 35\% when the least preferred anal self-examination
   attributes were offered.
   Interpretation If anal self-examination were recommended for anal
   syphilis screening, it will be important to consider preferences of MSM:
   men were more likely to undertake anal self-examination if the frequency
   was once a month and there was higher accuracy of detecting anal
   syphilis. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Understanding Weight Loss via Online Discussions: Content Analysis of
   Reddit Posts Using Topic Modeling and Word Clustering Techniques},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of
   developing many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and
   certain types of cancers. Online social media platforms are popular
   among people seeking social support regarding weight loss and sharing
   their weight loss experiences, which provides opportunities for learning
   about weight loss behaviors.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the
   content posted by users in the r/loseit subreddit, an online community
   for discussing weight loss, and online interactions were associated with
   their weight loss in terms of the number of replies and votes that these
   users received.
   Methods: All posts that were published before January 2018 in r/loseit
   were collected. We focused on users who revealed their start weight,
   current weight, and goal weight and were active in this online community
   for at least 30 days. A topic modeling technique and a hierarchical
   clustering algorithm were used to obtain both global topics and local
   word semantic clusters. Finally, we used a regression model to learn the
   association between weight loss and topics, word semantic clusters, and
   online interactions.
   Results: Our data comprised 477,904 posts that were published by 7660
   users within a span of 7 years. We identified 25 topics, including food
   and drinks, calories, exercises, family members and friends, and
   communication. Our results showed that the start weight (beta=.823;
   P<.001), active days (beta=.017; P=.009), and median number of votes
   (beta=.263; P=.02), mentions of exercises (beta=.145; P<.001), and
   nutrition (beta=.120; P<.001) were associated with higher weight loss.
   Users who lost more weight might be motivated by the negative emotions
   (beta=-.098; P<.001) that they experienced before starting the journey
   of weight loss. In contrast, users who mentioned vacations (beta=-.108;
   P=.005) and payments (beta=-.112; P=.001) tended to experience
   relatively less weight loss. Mentions of family members (beta=-.031;
   P=.03) and employment status (beta=-.041; P=.03) were associated with
   less weight loss as well.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that both online interactions and offline
   activities were associated with weight loss, suggesting that future
   interventions based on existing online platforms should focus on both
   aspects. Our findings suggest that online personal health data can be
   used to learn about health-related behaviors effectively.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPost traumatic seizures (PTS) and post traumatic epilepsy
   (PTE) are potential consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There
   is no consensus regarding its management among treating doctors.
   PurposeWe have undertaken a global survey to assess the variability of
   management practices of PTS and PTE and highlight the pressing need to
   formulate uniform practice guidelines. MethodsA questionnaire consisting
   of sixteen questions were developed with the help of Google survey and
   sent through e-mail, or social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook
   messenger or Telegram, to practicing Neurologists and Neurosurgeons
   round the world. ResultsThere were a total of 220 responses. Majority of
   our responders (n = 202; 91.8\%) would start an anti-epileptic (AED)
   prophylaxis to prevent PTS; 18 people (8.18\%) told that they would not
   start AED prophylaxis for TBI. Phenytoin (n = 98; 48.5\%) followed by
   Levetiracetam (n = 78; 38.6\%) was the preferred drug, although the
   latter was significantly preferred by high and upper middle-income
   countries (p001). Majority (n = 99; 49\%) would not use it beyond two
   weeks. Most clinicians would manage PTE with a single drug (n = 160;
   72.7\%) either Phenytoin (n = 69; 31.3\%) or levetiracetam (n = 67;
   30.4\%). Most of them (n = 174; 86\%) would treat for less than one
   year. ConclusionsPractices in the management of PTS and PTE vary widely
   among clinicians. Our study point towards the need for the development
   of a more robust and comprehensive practice guidelines for the
   management of the same.},

Title = {Addressing common questions on food oral immunotherapy: a practical
   guide for paediatricians},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 12},
Abstract = {Food allergy has been increasing in prevalence in most westernised
   countries and poses a significant burden to patients and families;
   dietary and social limitations as well as psychosocial and economic
   burden affect daily activities, resulting in decreased quality of life.
   Food oral immunotherapy (food-OIT) has emerged as an active form of
   treatment, with multiple benefits such as increasing the threshold of
   reactivity to the allergenic food, decreasing reaction severity on
   accidental exposures, expanding dietary choices, reducing anxiety and
   generally improving quality of life. Risks associated with food
   immunotherapy mostly consist of allergic reactions during therapy. While
   the therapy is generally considered both safe and effective, patients
   and families must be informed of the aforementioned risks, understand
   them, and be willing to accept and hedge these risks as being worthwhile
   and outweighed by the anticipated benefits through a process of shared
   decision-making. Food-OIT is a good example of a preference-sensitive
   care paradigm, given candidates for this therapy must consider multiple
   trade-offs for what is considered an optional therapy for food allergy
   compared with avoidance. Additionally, clinicians who discuss OIT should
   remain increasingly aware of the growing impact of social media on
   medical decision-making and be prepared to counter misconceptions by
   providing clear evidence-based information during in-person encounters,
   on their website, and through printed information that families can take
   home and review.},

Title = {Concussion knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in equestrian athletes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1055-1061},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective: To determine knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards
   concussion in adult equestrian athletes.
   Design: Nationwide, cross-sectional, questionnaire.
   Methods: Participants were recruited via advertisements circulated
   through social media, community presentations and equestrian
   organisations. Participants were sent a web link to an online
   questionnaire previously designed for high school athletes and modified
   to ensure relevance to equestrian activities. The percentage of correct
   responses per item and a total knowledge score were calculated.
   Differences in concussion knowledge by age, sex, level of experience and
   previous history of concussion were explored using t-tests, 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) and effect sizes.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 1486 participants (Mean age
   = 39.1 +/- 15.4). Knowledge of what concussion was, how to recognise it
   and key symptoms (except poor sleep) was high (>80\%). In contrast,
   awareness of guidelines was moderate (56\%) and inability of helmets to
   prevent concussion was low (12\%). Significantly higher levels of
   knowledge of concussion were identified in females compared with males
   (t=-6.55 p <0.001, 95\%CI=-3.26 to -1.75). The majority (87\%) of
   participants reported that a helmet should be replaced after a fall, yet
   46\% reported re-using a helmet following a hit to the head.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of and attitudes towards concussion were
   positive. However, there were knowledge gaps and discrepancies between
   some attitudes and behaviour on some aspects of concussion. Targeted
   campaigns to promote awareness of concussion and improve recognition and
   onward management are needed. Education related to equestrian activities
   such as helmet use and injury mechanisms is needed to change behaviour
   and minimise the risk of injury. (C) 2020 Sports Medicine Australia.

Abstract = {Background Gymnastics is a competitive sport with numerous health
   benefits. However, few data exist that examine the lasting effects of
   injuries in retired gymnasts. Objective To examine pain interference
   among former collegiate gymnasts. Specifically, we focused on the
   relationship between gymnastics-related injuries sustained during
   middle/high school or college that required surgery and former
   collegiate gymnasts' current pain. We hypothesized that injuries
   requiring surgery would be associated with increased pain and reduced
   function after retirement. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting An
   online questionnaire was distributed to former female collegiate
   gymnasts via social media. Participants A total of 447 former female
   collegiate gymnasts completed the survey and were grouped according to
   whether they indicated an injury during their middle/high school or
   collegiate gymnastics career that required surgery. Main Outcome
   Measures The association between current pain interference
   (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System {[}PROMIS]
   scale) and injuries in middle/high school or college that resulted in
   surgery. Pain interference elements included current enjoyment of life,
   ability to concentrate, participation in day-to-day activities,
   enjoyment of recreational activities, ability to perform errands, and
   ability to socialize with others. Results Those who reported an injury
   that resulted in surgery (n = 260; mean current age +/- SD = 32.8 +/-
   9.5 years) were younger than those who did not at the time of survey
   completion (n = 187; current age: 37.0 +/- 11.0 years) and reported
   beginning gymnastics at an earlier age (4.4 +/- 2.0 years vs. 5.1 +/-
   2.5 years; p = .001). There were no statistically significant
   differences between the groups on any PROMIS questions. In secondary
   analyses, we found a small but significant association between beginning
   gymnastics at an earlier age and the odds of requiring surgery (odds
   ratio = 1.11, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.02-1.21; p = .02).
   Conclusions Most retired gymnasts reported a gymnastics-related injury
   that required surgery. Gymnasts who start gymnastics at a younger age
   were more likely to sustain an injury that required surgery, but surgery
   was not associated with higher levels of pain interference.},

Abstract = {Objective In this study, we aim to describe the post-sepsis syndrome
   from the perspective of the sepsis survivors.
   Design and Setting The study is a prospective, observational online
   international survey.
   Participants Sepsis survivors enrolled via social media from 13
   September 2014 to 13 September 2016.
   Interventions None.
   Main Outcome Measures Physiologic, physical and psychological function
   post-sepsis; and patient satisfaction with sepsis-centered care.
   Results 1731 completed surveys from 41 countries were analyzed, with
   79.9\% female respondents, age 47.6 14.4 years. The majority of
   respondents (47.8\%) had sepsis within the last year. Survivors reported
   an increase in sensory, integumentary, digestive, breathing, chest pain,
   kidney and musculoskeletal problems after sepsis (all P-value <0.0001).
   Physical functions such as daily chores, running errands, spelling,
   reading and reduced libido posed increased difficulty (all P-value
   <0.0001). Within 7 days prior to completing the survey, the survivors
   reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep
   disturbance. Sepsis survivors reported dissatisfaction with a number of
   hospital support services, with up to 29.3\% of respondents stating no
   social services support was provided for their condition.
   Conclusions Sepsis survivors suffer from a myriad of physiologic,
   physical and psychological challenges. Survivors overall reveal
   dissatisfaction with sepsis-related care, suggesting areas for
   improvement both in-hospital and post-discharge.},

Abstract = {Introduction Diagnosing psoriasis in children can be challenging. Early
   and accurate diagnosis is important to ensure patients receive psoriasis
   specific treatment and monitoring. It is recognised that the physical,
   psychological, quality of life, financial and comorbid burden of
   psoriasis are significant. The aim of this study is to develop clinical
   examination and history-based diagnostic criteria for psoriasis in
   children to help differentiate psoriasis from other scaly inflammatory
   rashes. The criteria tested in this study were developed through a
   consensus study with a group of international psoriasis experts
   (International Psoriasis Council).
   Methods and analysis Children and young people (<18 years) with
   psoriasis (cases) and other scaly inflammatory skin diseases (controls)
   diagnosed by a dermatologist are eligible for recruitment. All
   participants complete a single research visit including a diagnostic
   criteria assessment by a trained investigator blinded to the
   participant's diagnosis. The reference standard of a dermatologist's
   diagnosis is extracted from the medical record. Sensitivity and
   specificity of the consensus derived diagnostic criteria will be
   calculated and the best predictive criteria developed using multivariate
   logistic regression.
   Ethics and dissemination Health Regulatory Authority and National Health
   Service Research Ethics Committee approvals were granted in February
   2017 (REC Ref: 17/EM/0035). Dissemination will be guided by
   stakeholders; patients, children and young people, dermatologists,
   primary care and paediatric rheumatologists. The aim is to publish the
   study results in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal, present the
   findings at international academic meetings and disseminate more widely
   through social media and working with patient associations.

Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are a rising threat to biodiversity,
   national security, and regional economies, with impacts in the hundreds
   of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Proactive or predictive approaches
   guided by scientific knowledge are essential to keeping pace with
   growing impacts of invasions under climate change. Although the rapid
   development of diverse technologies and approaches has produced tools
   with the potential to greatly accelerate invasion research and
   management, innovation has far outpaced implementation and coordination.
   Technological and methodological syntheses are urgently needed to close
   the growing implementation gap and facilitate interdisciplinary
   collaboration and synergy among evolving disciplines. A broad review is
   necessary to demonstrate the utility and relevance of work in diverse
   fields to generate actionable science for the ongoing invasion crisis.
   Here, we review such advances in relevant fields including remote
   sensing, epidemiology, big data analytics, environmental DNA (eDNA)
   sampling, genomics, and others, and present a generalized framework for
   distilling existing and emerging data into products for proactive IAS
   research and management. This integrated workflow provides a pathway for
   scientists and practitioners in diverse disciplines to contribute to
   applied invasion biology in a coordinated, synergistic, and scalable

Title = {Assessment of Knowledge and Attitude Toward Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
   Among Women in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {PurposePelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a serious infection of the
   female reproductive system that can lead to long-term complications such
   as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy. PID is also
   associated with an increased risk of HIV infection and other sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs). Early diagnosis and treatment of PID is
   crucial to prevent complications. Despite the severe consequences of
   PID, many women are unaware of the risks associated with this condition.
   This lack of awareness can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment,
   increasing the risk of complications. This study explores women's
   knowledge and attitudes regarding PID.MethodsA cross-sectional survey
   was conducted using a bilingual, community-based questionnaire,
   circulated using different social media platforms. A total of 239
   participants were selected through convenient non-probability sampling
   from the public in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collected data was
   analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp. Released 2019. IBM
   SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The
   chi-square test was applied to determine the differences between
   knowledge and attitude levels with participants' socio-demographic
   characteristics. A p-value <0.005 was considered statistically
   significant.ResultsAppropriate PID knowledge level was found only in
   32\% of the respondents and was significantly associated with the
   respondents' family history of the PID (p=0.025). A positive attitude
   toward PID/STI was also observed only in 36\% of the study participants,
   which was significantly associated with the respondents' age (p`0.001),
   marital status (p`0.001), occupation (p` 0.001), past medical/surgical
   history (p=0.006), and family history of the PID (p`0.009).ConclusionThe
   present study reported average levels of appropriate knowledge and
   attitudes toward PID among female respondents, which could be further
   improved by increasing PID/STI awareness programs.},

Abstract = {Background: Urolithiasis is the most common urological problem
   worldwide. It is a recurrent multifactorial problem that is caused by
   the interaction of several environmental and genetic factors. This study
   aimed to assess the prevalence of renal stones among local residents in
   Saudi Arabia in order to renew the statistics of renal stones occurrence
   in the current Saudi population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was
   conducted using an electronic questionnairethat was distributed randomly
   through phones and social media to reach the local residents in Saudi
   Arabia. We then reviewed the published papers in Saudi journals for
   patients with renal stones. Results: From a total of 580 responders to
   the electronic questionnaire, the prevalence of renal stones was 9.1\%
   (n = 64). The median age at diagnosis was 29 years and the mean age at
   diagnosis was 36.91 years (SD = 18.66, Range of 20-99). Two peaks of age
   were observed, the first peak was at the (21-25) age group representing
   34.4\% of the kidney stones patients. The second peak was older than 47
   years. The majority of those diagnosed with kidney stones had normal BMI
   (n = 29, 45.3\%), and the family history of kidney stones among first
   degree relatives was found in 35.9\% of the cases (n = 23). Conclusion:
   Kidney stones is a common health problem with the local incidence being
   underreported. In our sample, the prevalence was 9.1\%. We also observed
   a relatively high percentage of positive family history among renal
   stone patients (34.9\%) that could be attributed to the high rates of
   consanguinity. We encourage more local epidemiological studies to
   describe the patterns and the contributing factors of the development of
   kidney stones.},

Abstract = {Background: Knowledge and positive attitude toward vitiligo would foster
   support for affected individuals, improving their sense of well-being
   and possibly treatment outcome. Purpose: To evaluate the levels of
   public knowledge and attitude toward vitiligo among Saudis. Methods:A
   cross-sectional study among 12,181 participants. Data were collected
   using a self-administered questionnaire enquiring about knowledge,
   attitude, and perceptions in vitiligo. Results: The response rate was
   95.4\%. Most respondents had heard about vitiligo (96.9\%). The median
   knowledge score was four out of eight and median attitude score was six
   out of eight. Social media/Internet was the most commonly reported
   source of information (34.7\%), followed by family/friends/acquaintances
   (30\%). Higher proportions of correct responses were recorded regarding
   the noninfectious nature of vitiligo (85.0\%) and whether vitiligo was
   dangerous or connected to skin cancer (63.4\%). However, unsatisfactory
   responses were found regarding the immunological basis of the condition:
   only 24.3\% knew that vitiligo was an immune disease and 24.5\% knew
   about the role of heredity in vitiligo. The majority of respondents did
   not mind employing patients with vitiligo (89.0\%). Only 40.6\%
   responded that they would many someone with vitiligo. Positive attitude
   was significantly common in respondents aged 31-50 years (P < 0.01),
   women (P < 0.01), and those who had a university degree or higher (P <
   0.05). Conclusion: Although overall attitude toward vitiligo patients
   was positive, there were gaps in the knowledge, particularly regarding
   the nature of the disease. More awareness and education are required to
   improve attitude toward vitiligo patients, with an aim to improve their
   overall well-being.},

Title = {Contraceptive Access and Use Among Undergraduate and Graduate Students
   During COVID-19: Online Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread college campus
   closures in the months of March to June 2020, endangering students'
   access to on-campus health resources, including reproductive health
   services.Objective: To assess contraceptive access and use among
   undergraduate and graduate students in North Carolina during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based
   survey of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at
   degree-granting institutions in North Carolina. Participants were
   recruited using targeted Instagram advertisements. The survey queried
   several aspects of participants' sexual behavior, including sex drive,
   level of sexual experience, number of sexual partners, digital sexual
   experience, dating patterns, and types of contraception used.
   Participants were asked to compare many of these behaviors before and
   after the pandemic. The survey also assessed several sociodemographic
   factors that we hypothesized would be associated with contraceptive use
   based on prior data, including educational background, sexual
   orientation and gender minority status (ie, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer), health insurance status, race, ethnicity, degree of
   sensation seeking, religiosity, and desire to become pregnant.Results:
   Over 10 days, 2035 Instagram users began our survey, of whom 1002 met
   eligibility criteria. Of these 1002 eligible participants, 934 completed
   the survey, for a 93\% completion rate. Our respondents were mostly
   female (665/934, 71\%), cisgender (877/934, 94\%), heterosexual
   (592/934, 64\%), white (695/934 75\%), not Hispanic (835/934, 89\%), and
   enrolled at a 4-year college (618/934, 66\%). Over 95\% (895/934) of
   respondents reported that they maintained access to their preferred
   contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a multivariable analysis,
   participants who were enrolled in a 4-year college or graduate program
   were less likely to lose contraceptive access when compared to
   participants enrolled in a 2-year college (risk ratio {[}RR] 0.34, 95\%
   CI 0.16-0.71); in addition, when compared to cisgender participants,
   nonbinary and transgender participants were more likely to lose
   contraceptive access (RR 2.43, 95\% CI 1.01-5.87). Respondents reported
   that they were more interested in using telehealth to access
   contraception during the pandemic. The contraceptive methods most
   commonly used by our participants were, in order, condoms (331/934,
   35.4\%), oral contraception (303/934, 32.4\%), and long-acting
   reversible contraception (LARC; 221/934, 23.7\%). The rate of LARC use
   among our participants was higher than the national average for this age
   group (14\%). Emergency contraception was uncommonly used (25/934,
   2.7\%).Conclusions: Undergraduate and graduate students in North
   Carolina overwhelmingly reported that they maintained access to their
   preferred contraceptive methods during the COVID-19 pandemic and through
   changing patterns of health care access, including telehealth. Gender
   nonbinary and transgender students and 2-year college students may have
   been at greater risk of losing access to contraception during the first
   year of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {Reproducibility and relative validity of a newly developed web-based
   food-frequency questionnaire for assessment of preconception diet},
Journal = {BMC NUTRITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe importance of diet and nutrition during preconception age
   is a window of opportunity to promote future parental and
   transgenerational health. As a sub-study to a large Norwegian study,
   `Diet today - health of tomorrow', a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
   was developed to assess diet during the preconception phase in young
   adults aged 20 - 30years and in this paper we report the reproducibility
   and relative validity of this questionnaire.MethodsThe FFQ was developed
   from an existing FFQ validated in adolescents. Participants were
   recruited on social media and at a university. Reproducibility was
   assessed by comparing the test and retest of the FFQ. Relative validity
   was assessed by comparing intake measured by the FFQ with a 7-day
   weighed food record. Energy, nutrients and food intake were used to
   assess the reproducibility and relative validity of the FFQ. The study
   applied the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, percentage of
   agreement and Cohen's Kappa to assess reproducibility and
   validity.ResultsThere were 32 participants recruited to the study, of
   which 21 participants completed both the test-retest reproducibility and
   the relative validation. The test-retest reproducibility had a median
   correlation coefficient of 0.85 for energy and nutrients, a median
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.75 and a median Cohen's
   Kappa of 0.51 for food groups. The relative validity of the FFQ had a
   median correlation coefficient of 0.59 for energy and nutrients, a
   median Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.54 and a median
   Cohen's Kappa of 0.28 for food groups.ConclusionThis newly developed FFQ
   for preconception diet in young adults had a satisfactory test-retest
   reproducibility and fair relative validity.},

Title = {Closing the Breast Cancer Loop: Barriers and Perceptions of Breast
   Reconstruction among Rural Women},
Journal = {PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background:
   Despite policies such as the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act
   (WHCRA) and Breast Cancer Patient Education Act, rates for breast
   reconstruction vary and are especially low for some subpopulations of
   patients, especially rural women. In order to better understand patient
   perceptions, qualitative analysis using focus groups is an underutilized
   tool for obtaining patient perspectives regarding health-related issues
   and access to care. Our aim was to better understand patient perceptions
   using qualitative analysis.
   Methods:
   Three focus groups were held in rural counties within West Virginia in
   order to better understand patient perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs
   regarding breast health, breast cancer, access to breast reconstruction,
   and how to disseminate and educate this patient population regarding
   their right to accessing breast reconstruction.
   Results:
   Major themes analyses revealed perceived barriers to care related to
   lacking care coordination, lack of insurance coverage and other
   resources, as well as issues related to transportation. Participants
   consistently discussed avoiding breast screening care due fear and
   denial in addition to pain. Few patients were aware of their right to
   accessing breast reconstruction per the WHCRA, and many were concerned
   about follow-up burden, complications, and general fear related to
   breast reconstruction. Themes related to dissemination of information to
   promote the option of breast reconstruction included social media,
   patient counseling by their referring physician, and other means of
   intervention in clinics and other points in the care coordination chain.
   Conclusions:
   Rural women have important, unique viewpoints regarding access to and
   perceived barriers from obtaining breast reconstruction. Plastic
   surgeons must work diligently to educate, disseminate, and improve care
   coordination among this population in order to improve access to breast
   reconstruction among rural breast cancer patients.},

Title = {Acceptance, hesitancy and refusal towards COVID-19 vaccination},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Month = {2023 MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Problem: The determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and
   refusal remain poorly understood. We assessed the general population of
   Pune after visiting tertiary care hospital for their willingness to
   accept the vaccine and the reason for their hesitancy and
   refusal.Methodology: A six-month descriptive cross-sectional study with
   386 community members over the age of 18 who visited the Tertiary
   Hospital OPD was conducted. The vaccine acceptance and hesitancy was
   assessed using a self designed detailed questionnaire with a one-time
   face-to-face interview.Results: Acceptance for vaccine was observed in
   235 (60.8\%) participants, while 151 (39.2\%) hesitated and refused.
   Participants with lower education (P < 0.00001), no employment did not
   readily accept the vaccine (P < 0.00001). Pregnant, breast-feeding women
   (21.8\%) hesitated vaccine because of lack of evidence regarding vaccine
   safety. Participants (73.6\%) were readily accepting (third dose)
   booster dose of vaccine when available. The reason for vaccine hesitance
   was the concern about side effects (58.2\%) and reason for acceptance
   was to get immunity against COVID-19 (76.1\%). Vaccine information
   source appears to be an influential aspect, as participants who obtained
   vaccination information from healthcare providers had no concerns
   regarding vaccination.Conclusion: The study has found a link between
   average education level, unemployment and vaccine acceptance and
   hesitancy. Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy include lack of vaccine
   information, vaccine side effects, and misinformation spread via social
   media. Clinical pharmacists can play an important role in boosting up
   vaccine acceptance by providing appropriate information in community.},

Title = {A Cross-Sectional Survey of Knowledge of Skin Cancer in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL \& CONCEPTUAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Skin cancer has become one of the world's leading health
   problems, and incidence rates are on the rise. The leading causes of
   skin cancer are sun exposure, family history and sunburn, and the most
   agreed-upon preventative behaviors are sunscreen application and sun
   avoidance.
   Objectives: This study assessed the knowledge of the causes of skin
   cancer and awareness of preventative m ca res in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 529 participants in
   a WhatsApp group over 3 months. Consenting participants completed a
   validated, 18-item questionnaire.
   Results: Of 529 total participants, nearly 55\% of participants reported
   an awareness of skin cancer, 35\% understood its metastasis and 55.1\%
   knew about its spread. However, 44\% of participants were unaware of the
   different types of the disease. Social media was reported to be the most
   common source of information. The majority of participants were able to
   identify symptoms of skin cancer and had knowledge of risk factors. Most
   participants understood proper preventative measures, and reported that
   they use sunscreen regularly.
   Conclusions: The general knowledge of skin cancer in Saudi Arabia is not
   high but is increasing. However sun-protective behaviors are lacking,
   despite the population's knowledge of the benefits. Awareness campaigns
   and incentive programs may encourage better preventative behavior.
   Future studies should explore participants' awareness of more specific
   aspects of skin cancer using a more diverse and extensive population
   sample.},

Title = {A survey of psychological distress among Bangladeshi people during the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {2021 APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Previous studies conducted on the psychological impact of
   infectious outbreaks have found heavy psychological burdens among
   general population with more severe affect in the current pandemic. The
   main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress
   during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher
   psychological distress.
   Methods: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from
   March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above
   using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and
   other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate
   of 34\%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index
   (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis
   was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the
   associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic
   regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome
   variable by exposure variables.
   Results: Overall, 44.3\% of respondents were suffering from mild to
   moderate distress and 9.5\% were suffering from severe distress. Female
   respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to
   severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of
   Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet
   region (p-value = 0.035).
   Conclusion: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are
   experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by
   different symptoms and predictors. This study suggest the need to
   develop comprehensive crisis prevention system including epidemiological
   monitoring, screening, and referral with targeted intervention to reduce
   psychological distress.},

Title = {Elementary school teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward emergency

Journal = {BRAZILIAN ORAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Abstract = {The consequences of traumatic dental injuries can be even more serious
   when their emergency management procedures are inadequate. Since
   traumatic accidents frequently occur at school, it is crucial that
   teachers be knowledgeable enough to assist an injured child. This study
   aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the elementary school
   teachers of a Brazilian city toward dental trauma in permanent teeth,
   and its emergency practices. A combination of convenience and snowball
   sampling methods was used. An online questionnaire was distributed
   through social media, consisting of three parts: demographic
   characteristics and professional information; previous experiences and
   attitudes toward dental trauma; teachers' knowledge of this subject.
   Descriptive and statistical analyses were carried out. Pearson
   chi-squared test (p < 0.05) was used. A total of 217 teachers
   participated in the study. The power of the sample was 95\%. Half of the
   teachers had already witnessed a dental trauma incident involving
   students, and 70.5\% never received any information on the subject. The
   teachers who were provided previous information were the ones who opted
   to search for the tooth fragment (p=0.036) in cases of crown fracture,
   and for the lost tooth (p = 0.025) in cases of avulsion. They were also
   the ones who chose to wash the tooth in running water (p = 0.018), and
   look for a dentist in the first 30 or 60 minutes after the trauma (p =
   0.026). Most of the teachers assessed did not have adequate knowledge of
   dental trauma. Having previous information was associated with more
   assertive practices in trauma management.},

Abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the
   mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by
   mental health service users. Methods We investigated staff reports
   regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on
   mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a
   mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional
   associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative
   findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis
   conducted for qualitative data. Results 2,180 staff from a range of
   sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection
   control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of
   working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations
   in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working.
   This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical
   situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service
   users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic
   anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness,
   domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and
   follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with
   remote care. Conclusion This overview of staff concerns and experiences
   in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research
   and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection
   control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve
   effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community,
   should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be
   noted.},

Title = {`It all dials back to safety': A qualitative study of social and
   economic vulnerabilities among transgender women participating in HIV
   research in the USA},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Transgender women (TW) are highly burdened by HIV infection in the USA.
   Research is needed into drivers of the HIV epidemic for TW, including
   longitudinal studies to identify risks for incident HIV infection and
   optimal intervention targets. This formative research sought to
   understand TW's experiences with, perceptions of and barriers and
   facilitators to HIV research participation to inform future research
   implementation.
   Design
   Between August 2017 and January 2018, five online synchronous
   computer-mediated focus groups were conducted in English and two in
   Spanish. Recruitment used a mixed format of technology, such as
   geotargeted social media, and non-technology infused methods, such as
   peer referrals. Maximum variation sampling was used to enrol
   participants across a wide range of characteristics. Qualitative codes
   were iteratively developed and applied to focus group discussion
   transcripts by independent analysts.
   Setting
   Participants were recruited from Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New
   York City and Washington D.C.
   Participants
   Participants identified as TW >= 18 years and resided in one of the six
   metropolitan areas or outlying regions. 33 participants elected to
   partake in English focus groups and eight participated in Spanish-led
   groups.
   Results
   The geographically diverse sample had a mean age of 41.1 years
   (SD=13.6), and 34\% identified as Black African American and 29\% as
   Hispanic/Latina. Social and economic factors were found to shape HIV
   research participation for TW. Barriers to HIV research participation
   included limited research opportunities, mistrust, fear of mistreatment,
   safety and confidentiality, competing priorities and HIV stigma.
   Facilitators to HIV research participation were peer involvement and
   engagement, monetary and non-monetary incentives, flexibility and
   choices, multiple modalities and methods, and transcenteredness.
   Conclusion
   It is critical to address the social and economic vulnerabilities
   surrounding HIV research participation for TW. Results from this study
   can inform the design and implementation of gender-affirming and
   culturally tailored approaches to HIV research with TW.},

Title = {Population Size Estimation of Female Sex Workers in Hai Phong, Vietnam:
   Use of Three Source Capture-Recapture Method},

Abstract = {Introduction: A study was conducted in three districts in Hai Phong
   province, Vietnam to estimate the population size of the Female Sex
   Workers (FSW) in June-July 2019.
   Methods: The procedures included selection of three districts,
   compilation of a list of accessible venues where FSW congregate,
   distribution of first unique objects (first capture) and second unique
   objects (second capture) to FSW in randomly selected venues and
   implementation of a Mini-Respondent Driven Sampling (mRDS) Survey (third
   capture). Population size of the FSW was calculated based on the number
   of FSW in each round, number of FSW `recaptured' during the second and
   the third captures. Additionally, personal network size data captured in
   the mRDS was used to measure the population of FSW within the three
   districts using Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates (SS-PSE).
   Results: The total estimated FSWs in the three selected districts, using
   Three Source Capture-Recapture (3S-CRC) was 958, which is slightly lower
   than that estimated using SS-PSE - 1192. The 3S-CRC method yielded a
   provincial estimate of 1911 while the SS-PSE method resulted in a total
   of 2379 FSW for the province.
   Conclusion: Two techniques produced different PSE at both the district
   and the province levels and resulted in estimates lower than ones
   produced using programmatic data. For planning HIV prevention and care
   service needs among all FSWs, additional studies are needed to estimate
   the number of sex workers who are not venue-based and use social media
   platforms to sell services. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Atlantis

Abstract = {BackgroundFollowing the mpox 2022 outbreak, several high-income
   countries have developed plans with inclusion criteria for vaccination
   against the mpox disease. This study was carried out to map the factors
   influencing mpox vaccination uptake to help address the challenges and
   increase vaccination confidence.MethodsThis was a study based on Tweet
   analysis. The VADER, Text Blob, and Flair analyzers were adopted for
   sentiment analysis. The ``Levesque conceptual framework for healthcare
   access{''} was adopted to evaluate the factors impacting access and the
   decision to get mpox vaccination. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting
   Qualitative Research (COREQ) criteria were adopted.FindingsA total of
   149,133 tweets were extracted between 01/05/2022 and 23/09/2022. Around
   1\% of the random tweets were used for qualitative analysis. Of the
   149,113, tweets were classified as positive, negative and neutral,
   respectively, by (a) VADER: (55,040) 37.05\%, (44,395) 29.89\%, and
   (49,106) 33.06\%, (b) TextBlob: (70,900) 47.73\%, (22,729) 15.30\%, and
   (54,921) 36.97\%, and (c) Flair: (31,389) 21.13\%, (117,152) 78.87\%,
   and 0.00\%. Sentiment trajectories revealed that communication,
   stigmatization, accessibility to and availability of vaccines, and
   concerns about vaccine safety as factors influencing decision-making in
   the content and flow of tweets.InterpretationTwitter is a key
   surveillance tool for understanding factors influencing decisions and
   access to mpox vaccination. To address vaccine mistrust and
   disinformation, a social media-based risk communication plan must be
   devised. Adopting measures to remove logistical vaccination hurdles is
   needed. Obtaining fact-based information from credible sources is key to
   improving public confidence.},

Abstract = {Background Literature on health promotion evaluation and public
   understanding of health suggests the importance of investigating
   behaviour over time in conjunction with information environment trends
   as a way of understanding programme impact. We analysed population
   response to online promotion of an educational tool built by the Ask
   About Aspirin campaign in the USA to inform people about aspirin as a
   preventive aid.
   Methods We collected 156 weeks of time series data on audience
   behaviour, namely use of a self-assessment tool. We then used the
   Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling to predict
   that outcome as a function of paid search engine advertising, paid
   social media promotion and general search interest in aspirin.
   Results Through ARIMA modelling of tool engagement data adjusted for
   outcome series autocorrelation, we found a significant effect of online
   promotional effort on audience behaviour. Total paid search advertising
   positively predicted weekly total of individuals who started using the
   self-assessment tool, coefficient=0.023, t=3.28, p=0.001. This effect
   did not appear to be an artefact of broader secular trends, as Google
   search data on the topic of aspirin use did not add explanatory power in
   the final model nor did controlling for general search interest
   eliminate the significant coefficient for paid search promotion.
   Conclusion Results hold implications both for educational tool
   development and for understanding health promotion campaign effects. We
   witnessed substantial but ephemeral effects on tool use as a function of
   paid search efforts, suggesting prioritisation of efforts to affect
   search engine results as a dissemination tactic.},

Title = {Which older emergency patients are at risk of intracranial bleeding
   after a fall? A protocol to derive a clinical decision rule for the
   emergency department},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Introduction Falling on level ground is now the most common cause of
   traumatic intracranial bleeding worldwide. Older adults frequently
   present to the emergency department (ED) after falling. It can be
   challenging for clinicians to determine who requires brain imaging to
   rule out traumatic intracranial bleeding, and often head injury decision
   rules do not apply to older adults who fall. The goal of our study is to
   derive a clinical decision rule, which will identify older adults who
   present to the ED after a fall who do not have clinically important
   intracranial bleeding.
   Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study enrolling
   patients aged 65 years or older, who present to the ED of 11 hospitals
   in Canada and the USA within 48 hours of having a fall. Patients are
   included if they fall on level ground, off a chair, toilet seat or out
   of bed. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of clinically important
   intracranial bleeding within 42 days of the index ED visit. An
   independent adjudication committee will determine the primary outcome,
   blinded to all other data. We are collecting data on 17 potential
   predictor variables. The treating physician completes a study data form
   at the time of initial assessment, prior to brain imaging. Data
   extraction is supplemented by an independent, structured electronic
   medical record review. We will perform binary recursive partitioning
   using Classification and Regression Trees to derive a clinical decision
   rule. Ethics and dissemination The study was initially approved by the
   Hamilton Integrated Research
   Ethics Committee and subsequently approved by the research ethics boards
   governing all participating sites. We will disseminate our results by
   journal publication, presentation at international meetings and social
   media.},

Abstract = {Background
   The preventive measure of Coronavirus Disease pandemic, such as
   nationwide lockdown, might lead to stress, depression, and anxiety,
   prominently in adolescents. Many factors were indicated to influence its
   severity. This study aimed to investigate the magnitude of
   COVID-19-related mental health problems in adolescents and the
   associated factors.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study gathered 2018 adolescents throughout
   Indonesia from April 22nd-28th 2020. The questionnaire was spread
   through social media and included Kessler-10 Psychological Distress
   scale and closed-ended questions about the risk and protective factors.
   The results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis
   test, and Logistic Regression.
   Results
   The participants were mostly males (91.8\%) with a median age of 19. The
   results showed 54.1\% experienced varying degrees of distress. All
   variables were significantly related with psychological distress during
   Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis test. The logistic regression analysis
   showed maintaining or improving dietary pattern and sleep quality was
   found to be protective against psychological distress (OR = 0.497,95\%CI
   = 0.34-0.725 and OR = 0.515,95\%CI = 0.372-0.714, respectively), while
   others were risk factors, i.e.: Not having a confidant (OR =
   1.539,95\%CI = 1.226-1.931), frequent argument with parents (OR =
   1.735,95\%CI = 1.343-2.24), feeling worried (OR = 2.364,
   95\%CI=1.528-3.656), chronic diseases (OR = 2.601,95\%CI = 1.468-4.606),
   and mental illnesses (OR = 9.866,95\%CI = 3.855-25.249).
   Conclusion
   More than half of adolescents experienced distress. The findings called
   for initiatives by experts in providing psychosocial support for
   adolescents.},

Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: E-cigarettes (e-cigs) are typically promoted as a safer
   alternative to traditional cigarette smoking, particularly through
   social media platforms. E-cigs smoking is spreading at a high rate among
   young adults.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of e-cigs usage among Health Care Professionals (HCPs) in
   Jordan, as well as to investigate their knowledge and attitudes
   concerning e-cigs use.Methods: Eligible participants were asked to
   answer an electronic cross-sectional questionnaire. A total of 532
   online questionnaires were completed. Statistical analyses were
   conducted to assess HCPs' knowledge and attitudes regarding e-cigs
   use.Results: Approximately 16.9 \% of HCPs were e-cigs ever users.
   According to the multivariate analysis, HCPs who used conventional
   cigarettes were 7.3 times more likely to use e-cigs (p-value<0.001).
   Being a male was 2.8 times more likely than a female to have ever used
   e-cigs (p-value = 0.008). Those who lived alone were 3 times more likely
   to use e-cigs than those who lived with relatives or friends (p-value =
   0.007). Furthermore, being exposed to e-cigs' secondhand smoke from a
   family member (p-value = 0.038), friend (p-value = 0.008) or roommate
   (p-value = 0.008) increased the likelihood of being an e-cigs ever-user.
   HCPs stated that they hadn't received adequate education regarding
   e-cigs during college study.Conclusions: The study's outcomes have
   uncovered the need for educational interventions to promote HCPs comfort
   upon dealing with e-cigs use. Moreover, there is a further need to focus
   on substance use education, including e-cigs, in health schools.},

   attention},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {2021 OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted health care workers in many
   ways including mental health. This impact is usually underestimated in
   particular in developing countries. Objectives: The study aims to assess
   the level of anxiety, depression, risk perception, and coping strategies
   of Albanian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to
   identify associated factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted from April to May
   2020 by recruiting health care personnel through the snowballing method.
   Data collection was carried out through social media using the
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9) by Google forms. Participants were recruited from
   all health care sectors including doctors, nurses, etc. working in both
   the public and private sectors.
   Results: 410 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Most
   participants were nurses (59.3\%), female (78.5\%), and belonged to the
   age group 26-40 years (46.3\%). Mild levels of anxiety were expressed in
   26.9\% of participants while 7.2\% of them expressed moderate levels.
   23.1\% and 12.1\% of participants expressed respectively mild and
   moderate depression levels. High levels of risk perception were found. A
   statistical association was found between occupation (p = 0.011), gender
   (p = 0.031), providing care for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.011), and the
   availably of mental health support in the workplace. Poor coping
   strategies were reported among participants.
   Conclusions: Mental health support should be a priority of the
   healthcare system in particular for young health care workers caring for
   COVID-19 patients. It can improve the mental health status of health
   care workers and their family members, impacting the quality of care
   provided.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The future and progress of a country is dependent on the
   children today. The advent of social media has been a double-edged sword
   by the way it has brought us closer and also resulted in anonymous ways
   of mental distress to children, which is already being tested by violent
   school environments and pressure to succeed resulting in the prevalence
   of different mental illness. Parents and school authorities should
   ensure that their children grow and thrive in the best and safest
   environment possible. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Mental
   Health Programme on promoting mental health characteristics among
   adolescents in a school located in Coimbatore. Method: A quasi
   experimental one group pre-test and post-test design was adapted for the
   study. A sample of 195 students were selected using stratified random
   proportionate sampling technique and made to answer the pre-test
   questionnaire followed by the mental health programme intervention. They
   were then made to answer the post-test questionnaire and the data was
   analysed. The data collection was initiated on June 2015 and ended on
   October 2016, the entire process took approximately 48 weeks excluding
   holidays and examinations. Result: The pre-test mean score was 8.35 +/-
   3.02 and the post-test mean score was 26.77 +/- 2.94 with a mean gain
   score of 18.42. The calculated paired `t' produced at value 62.278 which
   was found to be statistically highly significant (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The results of the present study concluded that the mental
   health promotion programme was effective in improving the mental health
   characteristics among adolescent children.},

Abstract = {Background: In urolithiasis, urinary calculi are formed in the urinary
   system. Stone development does not initially result in any symptoms, but
   later renal colic, flank pain, hematuria, obstruction of urine flow,
   and/or hydronephrosis may indicate renal stone disease. In addition to
   age, gender, ethnicity, and local climate, urolithiasis can be caused by
   several other factors. The prevalence and recurrence rate of kidney
   stone disease is rising globally, while few effective treatment options
   currently exist. Methods: Between June and October 2022, a
   cross-sectional study was conducted. An electronic questionnaire
   subdivided into three categories was used to determine the prevalence
   and identify the factors that increase the likelihood of developing
   urolithiasis among the population in Bisha. The collected data were
   reviewed and analyzed via IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics
   for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Results: A total of
   1,002 participants filled out the questionnaire. The age of the
   participants ranged from 18 to over 60 years, with an average age of
   26.1 \& PLUSMN; 13.9 years. There were 451 female participants (45\%),
   and 927 (92.5\%) were Saudis. According to the participants' body mass
   index, 98 (9.8\%) were underweight, 388 (38.7\%) were normal weight, 300
   (29.9\%) were overweight, and 216 (21.6\%) were obese. The total number
   of participants with urolithiasis was 161 (16.1\%), and 420 (41.9\%) had
   a family history of renal stones. Urolithiasis was found to be
   significantly associated with family history, smoking, diabetes,
   hypertension, hyperthyroidism, gout, and chronic kidney disease. Older
   age and female gender were also associated with the risk of having
   urolithiasis. Conclusion: This study found urolithiasis to be highly
   prevalent among the Bisha population. In terms of risk factors, body
   mass index, smoking, and diabetes were the most significant. Based on
   the findings of this study, the authors recommend more public education
   regarding urolithiasis and its risk factors, emphasizing the importance
   of preventing the disease and the ways of treating urolithiasis through
   medical campaigns and social media.},

Title = {Impact of change in household hygiene conditions on morbidity in India:
   Evidence from longitudinal survey},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {2021 JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The maintenance of good hygiene is more important to prevent
   communicable and infectious diseases. Therefore, the main aim of this
   study to assess the impact of change in household hygiene conditions on
   morbidity. The results from multivariate linear regression have shown
   that the percentage share of households members fell sick due to any
   short term morbidity were significantly higher (beta = 0.053, P < 0.001)
   among the households who had lived in the poor hygiene conditions in
   both years in 2005 and 2011 compared to the households who were lived in
   the better-off hygienic condition in both years in 2005 and 2011 after
   controlling various socio-economic variables. The household members who
   fell sick due to any short term morbidity had significantly declined
   (beta = -0.028, P < 0.04) among the households who were lived in the
   poor condition in 2005, but transformed into better off hygienic
   condition as a compared to the households who were lived in the poor
   hygienic condition in both years in 2005 and 2011. Similarly, the
   results from multinomial logistic regression shown that prevalence of
   any short term morbidity was significantly less likely among the
   households who were livid remain in the better-off hygienic condition in
   both years in 2005 and 2011 (2.8\%; p < 0.01) as compared to other
   households who were lived remain in the poor hygiene conditions in 2005
   and 2011 (4.8\%). Findings of this study suggest that not only improve
   the water and sanitation facilities which are prerequisites for hygiene
   but also improve the hygienic behavior of the households through social
   media.},

Title = {Media news on vaccines and vaccination: The content profile, sentiment
   and trend of the online mass media during 2015-2020 in India},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {2021 APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The immunization coverage progress in India is relatively
   slower than anticipated. The rising internet and media penetration and
   online news contents are likely to shape the public vaccine sentiments
   and attitude. The measles-rubella immunization campaign in India
   experienced challenges in some states due to the social media and
   messaging. This study studied the profile and vaccine sentiments of the
   online media news in India. Methods: We retrieved the online news on
   immunization and vaccines published in English during November 2015 to
   May 2020. The news were analysed for contents and categorised as
   positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Results: Out of 2626 news
   retrieved, 1788 eligible ones were analysed. The news focused on
   immunization program in 59.1\% and vaccine hesitancy in 7.7\% items.
   While 42.5\% news originated from national level, 33.2\% were from six
   states. Measles-rubella was the leading vaccine in the news (23.2\%)
   followed by coronavirus (12.8\%), poliomyelitis (10.4\%) and rotavirus
   (5.1\%) vaccines. While 71.4\% news conveyed positive sentiment, 23.8\%
   and 4.7\% had negative and neutral sentiments, respectively. The
   negative sentiments focused on adverse events, vaccine hesitancy and
   resistance. The news volume and negative sentiments were largely linked
   to the measles-rubella vaccination campaign phases in India.
   Conclusions: Negative vaccine news constitute a sizable proportion of
   the online news and can influence the public vaccine sentiment and
   attitude. The experiences of public response towards measles-rubella,
   pentavalent and human papillomavirus vaccines suggest necessity of
   comprehensive media mapping and tracking to guide appropriately to
   sustain the public vaccine confidence and improve coverage.},

Title = {Psychosocial impacts on the Christchurch Muslim community following the
   15 March terrorist attacks: a mixed-methods study protocol},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction On 15 March 2019, a white supremacist gunman opened fire in
   two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayers, killing
   51 people and injuring 40. The event was witnessed by at least 250
   survivors and also live streamed on social media, leading to widespread
   and repeated exposure within the community. It is expected that
   survivors, families and community members will be at increased risk of
   developing mental disorders due to the scale and violence of these
   attacks. This protocol describes the first phase of a proposed
   longitudinal study to screen and assess the long-term impacts of the
   terrorist attack on members of the Christchurch Muslim community, to
   determine clinical need and facilitate access to appropriate
   interventions and to gain insights into working with such a traumatised,
   ethnically diverse population. It has been developed in close
   collaboration with members of that community. Methods and analysis A
   mixed-method design is described, combining self-report measures with a
   clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Participants include
   Christchurch Muslims aged 18 years and over, with a target sample size
   of n=200. Analyses will determine prevalence of major mental disorders,
   while regression analyses will model the relationship between pre-event
   features, trauma exposure and mental disorders. A small number of
   participants, stratified by exposure type, will also take part in a
   qualitative interview in English. All study information and self-report
   measures are provided in translations based on the ethnolinguistic
   composition of the group and are available in paper and online versions.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by the New Zealand
   Health and Disability Ethics Committee 19/NTA/147. All participants
   provide informed consent, either written or online via REDCap software.
   The study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
   Registry. Findings will be disseminated initially to the impacted
   community, then by publication in scientific journals, presentations and
   to government agencies.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Dog bites are a contentious issue within the United Kingdom due to their
   effect on public health and increasing incidence. Despite multiple
   expert-led dog bite prevention schemes being available, there is limited
   evidence regarding the surrounding factors and likely causes of a dog
   bite (e.g., dog/human behavior). An online convenience sample
   questionnaire was distributed through social media between December 2015
   and February 2016 targeting self-identified dog bite victims within the
   United Kingdom. A total of 484 responses were received. Victims were
   aged between 1 and 77 years when bitten. Most dogs (66.1\%) were known
   to the victim. The most common context of a dog bite is related to
   interacting or attempting to interact with the dog (e.g., stroking,
   playing, handling, and restraining); however, in many cases, the dog
   approached the victim (50\%). In 27\% of cases, the dog was known to
   have bitten someone previously. If the upper extremities were bitten, it
   was likely the person approached the dog, whereas for the lower
   extremities, it was more likely the dog approached the person. Most
   injuries did not require medical treatment (62.3\%), and there was no
   follow-on consequence for the dog involved (59.9\%). Bites to an owner
   from their own dog were more likely to be seen as ``accidental{''} and
   ``unintentional{''} than bites from a less familiar dog. This study
   found contexts in which dog bites occur vary widely, and thus, a number
   of different prevention measures are required, including addressing
   repeat biters. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {We have reviewed background information on the protection of healthcare
   data under the HIPAA regulatory requirements established in 1996 and
   updates to that regulation enacted with the HITECH Act to increase the
   protection of data. Each component of HIPAA was discussed, including
   transactions, privacy, and security rules. We have discussed the
   enforcement component and how enforcement and audits have increased with
   sizable penalties for disclosures by organizations across the United
   States. In addition, we have examined other regulatory requirements,
   including state laws that can override federal law when considered more
   stringent with respect to protections. We have also discussed the
   importance of public trust and nursing roles that are important for
   establishing strong policies and procedures in protecting the PHI and
   identity of individuals whom we care for on a daily basis. Most issues
   with security breaches are related to vulnerabilities created by human
   errors; therefore, we have also related common incidences of HIPAA
   violations and reviewed why they occurred and how to mitigate these
   types of incidents while emphasizing the importance of SRAs in that
   process. Population health data and the `` push and pull{''} between
   protecting privacy and disclosing adequate information to address
   epidemiologic and other research questions were discussed. Also examined
   was whether we as a nation have the right balance between open
   government and public disclosure of healthcare data for the common good
   versus potential risks of disclosing public domain data that might be
   used to identify individuals. New threats regarding cybersecurity were
   reviewed with special attention as to why these new threats are
   occurring, what they are, and what we can do as an industry to guard
   against these -exposures. Technical terms related to cybersecurity were
   noted and used within the context of threats that all healthcare
   professionals should be aware of to help guard against disclosures.
   Finally, an exercise is presented to consider the SRA tool established
   by the ONC and the Office of Civil Rights to assess organizations for
   adequate protections.},

   high-income (UHICs) countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate
   differences in the management of severe TBI patients, comparing low-and
   high-income, and adherence to the BTF guidelines. METHODS: A web-based
   survey was spread through the Global Neuro Foundation, different
   neurosurgical societies, and social media. RESULTS: A total of 803
   neurosurgeons participated: 70.4 from UHICs and 29.6\% from LMICs.
   Hypertonic was administered as an early measure by the 73\% and 65\% of
   the responders in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P=0.016). An invasive
   intracranial pressure monitoring was recommended by the 66\% and 58\% of
   the neurosurgeons in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P<0.001).
   Antiseizure drugs (P<0.001) were given most frequently in LMICs as,
   against recommendations, steroids (87\% vs. 61\% and 86\% vs. 81\%,
   respectively). In the LMICs both the evacuation of the contusion and
   decompressive craniectomy were performed earlier than in UHICs (30\% vs.
   17\% with P<0.001 and 44\% vs. 28\% with P=0.006, respectively). In the
   LMICs, the head CT control was performed mostly between 12 and 24 hours
   from the first imaging (38\% vs. 23\%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
   current Guidelines on TBI do not always fit to both the resources and
   circumstances in different countries. Future research and clinical
   practice guidelines should reflect the greater relevance of TBI in low
   resource settings.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Recently, the Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a major concern
   across the world. ZIKV can primarily spread through the bite of infected
   Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Till now, ZIKV is considered an incurable
   infectious disease. As Zika is an emerging disease of an international
   concern with the ongoing speculation about a potential outbreak in India
   in the future, the present study was conducted with an aim to assess
   knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding ZIKV among nursing
   students.
   Materials and Methods: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was
   conducted among 240 nursing students during 2019, and data were
   collected using a pretested, predesigned, standardized, and
   self-administered questionnaire. The ethical approval was obtained from
   the Institutional Ethical committee before the conduct of the study. All
   tests were performed at 5\% level of significance.
   Results: The present study has included 240 nursing students (228 female
   students and 12 male students). The most common source of information
   related to ZIKV was social media among 75.6\% of the students and 46.7\%
   of the participants has low knowledge regarding ZIKV. Surprisingly,
   about one-tenth of the participants (14.2\%) made an attempt to gain
   more knowledge about ZIKV, and nearly one-fifth of the participants were
   not using any method at all (17.1\%) to prevent mosquito bites.
   Conclusion: This study showed inadequate knowledge among nursing
   students which will be future health care providers about ZIKV
   infection. The awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and
   maintained among health care providers to face any possible emergence in
   the region.
   The following core competencies are addressed in this article: Medical
   knowledge, Patient care, Practice-based learning, and Systems-based
   practice.},

Abstract = {Objectives This study aimed at exploring the relationships between
   physical activity, weight control, and psycho-social aspects of the
   COVID-19 lockdown, which have characterized the Israeli population's
   behavior during the COVID-19 global crisis. Design Cross-sectional
   survey research. Methods Participants included 1855 men and women aged
   18 and above, from different regions in the country and representing
   different sectors. They were recruited through the social media in a
   ``snowball{''} sampling, and filled out a self-administered six-part
   survey: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity
   Questionnaire (IPAQ), the positive and negative affect scales (PANAS),
   the Conor and Davidson resilience scale, a questionnaire for measuring
   depressive symptoms, and questions regarding weight change based on the
   Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Results Routine
   physical activity (PA) was reported by 76.3\% of the participants before
   the lockdown, 19.3\% stopped exercising during this period, and 9.3\%
   began exercising during the lockdown. The participants who were
   physically active during the lockdown period reported a higher level of
   resilience and positive feelings, and a lower level of depression,
   compared with those who were not physically active. People who were
   physically active during the lockdown maintained their weight compared
   with those who were inactive. Concerning weight change, 44.8\% of the
   respondents maintained their weight, and a higher percentage of people
   reported weight gain than those who reported weight loss. Conclusions
   Continuous PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were associated
   with higher resilience and positive emotions, and depressive symptoms,
   in people aged 18 and above. Although a causal link cannot be
   established, in light of the results of the present study, encouraging
   physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense
   of self-efficacy, as well as to maintaining weight during a crisis.},

Abstract = {Community-based rapid HIV testing is effective for reaching
   racial-ethnically diverse men who have sex with men (MSM), offering an
   opportunity for bundled health promotion interventions. Given MSM
   experience a heightened prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and
   meningococcal disease, we examined their preferences for bundling rapid
   HIV testing with an intervention to promote vaccination against these
   infections. In 2020, we conducted five virtual focus groups (N = 25
   participants) in English and Spanish with MSM in Southern California's
   Inland Empire. Participants discussed their knowledge about HPV and
   meningitis vaccination and attitudes toward receiving vaccination
   information and referrals during rapid HIV tests. We used the rigorous
   and accelerated data reduction technique to systematically analyse the
   data. Participants had a mean age of 30, were socioeconomically diverse,
   and predominantly (68\%) Hispanic. 96\% had ever been tested for HIV,
   while only 28\% were vaccinated against HPV and/or meningitis. Most
   participants were unaware of MSM's elevated risk for HPV and meningitis
   and were eager to receive vaccination information from LGBTQ+-friendly
   providers. However, many participants emphasised rapid HIV testing was
   stressful and anticipated feeling overwhelmed if presented with
   vaccination information in this setting. Preferred formats for vaccine
   promotion included pamphlets and resources that could be discretely
   accessed online, supported by broader advertising featuring diverse MSM
   on social media, dating apps, and posters in the community. Overall, our
   findings suggest that bundling health promotion messages with rapid HIV
   testing may be ineffective, as the anxiety associated with taking an HIV
   test may interfere with such messages and their impact.},

Journal = {FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {375-381},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Food allergies are becoming more prevalent and affect up to 1-2\% of
   adults and 5-8\% of children in the UK. This study investigated the food
   allergen knowledge, attitude towards food allergens and food allergy
   management practices among food allergic and intolerant consumers and/or
   their family members and carers. Questionnaires were distributed at
   three major Free From events in the UK in 2017 and 2018. Structural
   Equation Modelling (SEM) was used as a confirmatory technique to
   determine the model's validity. Cereals containing gluten, milk and eggs
   were the most common triggers reported by the consumers. Other trigger
   foods such as chocolate, garlic, maize, onions, red and white meat,
   spices, and fruits such as apples and cherries were also reported.
   Consumers demonstrated very good understanding on the severity of
   allergic reactions, prevention method and hidden egg ingredients.
   Overall, consumers were relatively good in the knowledge section. The
   participants were motivated in their personal allergen avoidance towards
   food allergens especially in checking food labels, preference for more
   free from product choices and handwashing. Consumers did not rely on
   dietary apps or social media to find out about allergen-free food
   products. Both knowledge and attitude did not translate into food
   allergy management practices. Significant correlation between knowledge
   and attitude was identified suggesting that as knowledge decreases, so
   will their attitude scores. This study suggests that targeted and
   systematic food allergy management topics and peer support could be used
   to improve consumers' knowledge and attitude to positively impact food
   allergen handling practices.},

Title = {Phenotypic Environmental Sensitivity and Mental Health During Pregnancy
   and Post Partum: Protocol for the Experiences of Pregnancy Longitudinal
   Cohort Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Background: Mental health problems during pregnancy and post partum are
   common and associated with negative short- and long-term impacts on
   pregnant individuals, obstetric outcomes, and child socioemotional
   development. Socio-environmental factors are important predictors of
   perinatal mental health, but the effects of the environment on mental
   health are heterogeneous. The differential susceptibility theory and the
   environmental sensitivity framework suggest that individuals differ in
   their degree of sensitivity to positive and negative environments, which
   can be captured by individual phenotypes such as temperament and
   personality. While there is strong evidence for these models in
   childhood, few studies examined them in adults, and they were not
   examined in pregnancy.Objective: The primary objective of the
   Experiences of Pregnancy study is to explore whether childhood and
   current environments are associated with mental health and well-being in
   pregnancy and whether these effects depend on individual sensitivity
   phenotypes (personality). This study also aims to gather important
   psychosocial and health data for potential secondary data analyses and
   integrative data analyses. Methods: We will conduct a longitudinal
   cohort study. The study was not registered elsewhere, other than this
   protocol. Participants will be recruited through social media
   advertisements linking to the study website, followed by an eligibility
   call on Zoom (Zoom Video Communications). Participants must be aged 18
   years or older, currently residing in the United States as citizens or
   permanent residents, and currently planning to continue the pregnancy. A
   minimum of 512 participants will be recruited based on power analyses
   for the main objectives. Since the data will also be a resource for

Abstract = {The phenomenon of Internet child sexual abuse (ICSA) has been receiving
   growing attention over the last decade, and studies have promoted
   knowledge with respect to the phenomenon's epidemiology, as well as to
   characteristics of the victims, perpetrators, and dynamics in these
   cases. The current retrospective study sought to delve into the
   disclosure component in cases of ICSA. The sample comprised 52 cases of
   adolescents who arrived at a child advocacy center (CAC) following ICSA.
   Analysis of these cases was targeted to capture the multifaceted nature
   of disclosure using those perspectives that could be documented by the
   CAC staff-of the practitioners, the adolescents, and their parents.
   Beyond the descriptive results regarding the victims and the nature of
   the abuse, the case analyses illustrate the disclosure process as
   experienced by the various parties involved, highlighting the
   challenging nature of this aspect of the phenomenon. For the parents,
   the disclosure experience can perhaps be best epitomized by the
   expression that was heard repeatedly-{''}Stop waking the dead{''}-an
   expression that indicated their wish to bring the subject to a close.
   The difficulty in disclosing such incidents was also illustrated by the
   fact that 20 children in the current sample were reluctant to
   collaborate during the CAC process. In fact, according to these data,
   most of the incidents were revealed following a police investigation
   rather than by a disclosure initiated by the children themselves.
   Focusing on this specific aspect of ICSA-that is, disclosure-enables a
   new perspective on it and stresses the need to further study it in such
   cases. A better understanding of the disclosure experience as it
   pertains to the individuals involved in cases of ICSA may improve and
   help modify future prevention and intervention efforts in the field.},

Title = {Designing a Patient Portal for Patient-Centered Care: Cross-Sectional
   Survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: In recent literature, patient portals are considered as
   important tools for the delivery of patient-centered care. To date, it
   is not clear how patients would conceptualize a patient portal and which
   health information needs they have when doing so.
   Objective: This study aimed (1) to investigate health information needs,
   expectations, and attitudes toward a patient portal and (2) to assess
   whether determinants, such as patient characteristics, health literacy,
   and empowerment status, can predict two different variables, namely the
   importance people attribute to obtaining health information when using a
   patient portal and the expectations concerning personal health care when
   using a patient portal.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Flemish population
   on what patients prefer to know about their digital health data and
   their expectations and attitudes toward using a patient portal to access
   their electronic health record. People were invited to participate in
   the survey through newsletters, social media, and magazines. We used a
   questionnaire including demographics, health characteristics, health
   literacy, patient empowerment, and patient portal characteristics.
   Results: We received 433 completed surveys. The health information needs
   included features such as being notified when one's health changes
   (371/396, 93.7\%), being notified when physical parameters increase to
   dangerous levels (370/395, 93.7\%), observing connections between one's
   symptoms or diseases or biological parameters (339/398, 85.2\%), viewing
   the evolution of one's health in function of time (333/394, 84.5\%), and
   viewing information about the expected effect of treatment (349/395,
   88.4\%). Almost 90\% (369/412) of respondents were interested in using a
   patient portal. Determinants of patients' attachment for obtaining
   health information on a patient portal were (1) age between 45 and 54
   years (P=.05); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested attitude (P=.008)
   toward shared decision making; and (3) commitment to question
   physicians' decisions (P=.03, R-2=0.122). Determinants of patients'
   expectations on improved health care by accessing a patient portal were
   (1) lower education level (P=.04); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested
   attitude (P=.008) toward shared decision making; and (3) problems in
   understanding health information (P=.04; R-2=0.106).
   Conclusions: The interest in using a patient portal is considerable in
   Flanders. People would like to receive alerts or some form of
   communication from a patient portal in case they need to act to manage
   their health. Determinants such as education, attached importance to
   shared decision making, difficulties in finding relevant health
   information, and the attached importance in questioning the decisions of
   physicians need to be considered in the design of a patient portal.},

Abstract = {Background: Testicular cancer incidence rates are increasing worldwide
   making it the most common malignancy in males aged 15 to 45 years. More
   than 90\% of patients are cured with surgery, radiotherapy, and
   chemotherapy alone or a combination of them. This success depends on
   early and accurate disease diagnosis and the application of optimum
   treatment.
   Aim: to assess adults' awareness, attitude, and practice regarding
   testicular cancer (TC) and testicular self-examination (TSE) in Aseer
   region, Saudi Arabia.
   Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting
   all adults in Aseer region. The study was conducted during the period
   from February 2020 to May 2020. Data were collected using a structured
   questionnaire which was developed by the researchers after intensive
   literature review and expert's consultation. Adults' awareness regarding
   testicular cancer (TC) was assessed covering its main domains including
   general definition, signs and symptoms, age of incidence,
   self-examination methods, and curability. The questionnaire was uploaded
   online, using social media platforms, by the researchers and their
   relatives and friends. All adults fulfilling the inclusion criteria who
   received the electronic questionnaire during the study period were
   invited to participate through filling out the questionnaire.
   Results: The survey included 809 male participants who completed the
   questionnaire. Participants ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old with
   mean age of 26.9 12.7 years. The majority of participants (73.1\%; 591)
   were single while 23.7\% were married. Exactly 591 (73.1\%) participants
   had heard about cancer tests and 651 (80.5\%) knew it affects men.
   Regarding age susceptible to testicular cancer, 218 (26.9\%) of the
   participants reported 15-40 years old. About 5.1\% of the participants
   agreed that routine self-examination for TC is not important, 194 (24\%)
   reported it is important.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that male adult's
   awareness about TC and TSE are inadequate and the proportion who are
   performing it is below the average. Also, male adults' attitude towards
   TSE and its importance was not promising.},

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV
   globally, regionally in Canada, and locally in Vancouver. Lack of
   reliable population size estimates of MSM impedes effective
   implementation of health care services and limits our understanding of
   the HIV epidemic. We estimated the population size of MSM residing in
   Metro Vancouver drawing on four data sources: the Canadian Community
   Health Survey (CCHS), a cross-sectional bio-behavioural MSM survey, HIV
   testing services data from sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics
   serving MSM, and online social networking site Facebook. Estimates were
   calculated using (1) direct estimates from the CCHS, (2) ``Wisdom of the
   Crowds{''} (WOTC), and (3) the multiplier method using data from a
   bio-behavioural MSM survey, clinic-based HIV testing, and online social
   media network site Facebook. Data sources requiring greater public
   disclosure of sexual orientation resulted in our mid-range population
   estimates (Facebook 23,760, CCHS 30,605). The WOTC method produced the
   lowest estimate, 10,000. The multiplier method using STI clinic HIV
   testing data produced the largest estimate, 41,777. The median of all
   estimates was 27,183, representing 2.9\% of the Metro Vancouver census
   male adult population, with an interquartile range of 1.1-4.5\%. Using
   multiple data sources, our estimates of the MSM population in Metro
   Vancouver are similar to population prevalence estimates based on
   population data from other industrialized nations. These findings will
   support understanding of the HIV burden among MSM and corresponding
   public health and health services planning for this key population.},

Abstract = {The National Institutes of Health (NIH) minimum dataset for chronic low
   back pain (CLBP) was developed in response to the challenge of
   standardizing measurements across studies. Although reference values are
   critical in research on CLBP to identify individuals and communities at
   risk of poor outcomes such as disability, no reference values have been
   published for the Quebec (Canada) context. This study was aimed to (1)
   provide reference values for the Canadian version of the NIH minimum
   dataset among individuals with CLBP in Quebec, both overall and
   stratified by gender, age, and pain impact stratification (PIS)
   subgroups, and (2) assess the internal consistency of the minimum data
   set domains (pain interference, physical function, emotional distress or
   depression, sleep disturbance, and PIS score). We included 2847
   individuals living with CLBP who completed the baseline web survey of
   the Quebec Low Back Pain Study (age: 44.0 +/- 11.2 years, 48.1\% women)
   and were recruited through social media and healthcare settings. The
   mean score was 6.1 +/- 1.8 for pain intensity. Pain interference,
   physical function, emotional distress or depression, sleep disturbance,
   and PIS scores were 12.9 +/- 4.1, 14.4 +/- 3.9, 9.8 +/- 4.4, 13.0 +/-
   3.6, and 26.4 +/- 6.6, respectively. Emotional distress or depression
   showed floor effects. Good-to-excellent internal consistency was found
   overall and by language, gender, and age subgroups for all domains
   (alpha: 0.81-0.93) and poor-to-excellent internal consistency for PIS
   subgroups (alpha: 0.59-0.91). This study presents reference values and
   recommendations for using the Canadian version of the NIH minimum
   dataset for CLBP that can be useful for researchers and clinicians.},

Title = {Link Between the Female Athlete Triad and Gymnastics-Related Injury in
   Retired Collegiate Gymnasts},
Journal = {CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Objectives:To compare gymnastics-related injuries between former
   collegiate gymnasts who did and did not report components of the female
   athlete triad (Triad) during college, including disordered eating or
   menstrual irregularity. We hypothesized that athletes reporting these 2
   triad symptoms would have higher rates of time loss injury and injuries
   requiring surgery.Design:Retrospective case-control.Setting:Online
   survey.Patients:Four hundred seventy former collegiate
   gymnasts.Interventions:Athletes completed online survey distributed
   through social media.Main Outcome Measures:Participants were grouped
   based on self-reported menstrual irregularity and disordered eating
   during college. We compared time loss injuries, injuries resulting in
   surgery, and injury locations between the groups using \& chi;(2)
   analyses.Results:Seventy percent (n = 328) of participants in this study
   reported a time loss college injury without surgery, and 42\% (n = 199)
   reported an injury during college that required surgical treatment. A
   significantly greater proportion of gymnasts with only disordered eating
   reported a time loss gymnastics injury (without surgery) compared with
   those who reported only menstrual irregularity during college (79\% vs
   64\%; P =0 .03). A significantly greater proportion of the disordered
   eating-only group reported a spine injury compared with the menstrual
   irregularity-only group (P = 0.007) and the group who reported neither
   menstrual irregularity nor disordered eating (P =
   0.006).Conclusions:College gymnasts who experienced disordered eating
   were more likely to experience a nonsurgical time loss injury while in
   college, as well as spine injury compared with those with menstrual
   irregularity. Sports medicine providers should be aware of the
   association between injuries and individual components of Triad in
   gymnasts beyond bone stress injuries.},

Title = {Assessment of the Prevalence of the Use of Nasal Decongestants Among the
   General Population in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Background A topical nasal decongestant (NDC) is widely prescribed in
   ENT practice and used as self-medication because it is available over
   the counter, which makes it an easily accessible medication. Due to its
   common and long-term use, it is associated with serious nasal
   complications. It is commonly self-administrated in many otolaryngology
   diseases like the common cold, sinusitis, and acute or chronic rhinitis.
   The long-term usage of nasal decongestants is associated with
   significantly increased side effects. AimTo assess the prevalence of the
   usage of nasal decongestants among the general population in Saudi
   Arabia ad the pattern of its use. MethodologyA questionnaire-based,
   cross-sectional survey was applied to level all available populations in
   Saudi Arabia. Participants with ages aged 10 to 60 years old in Saudi
   Arabia were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected
   from participants using a predesigned online questionnaire. The
   questionnaire included the participant's demographic data, NDC use, and
   pattern of use. The questionnaire was uploaded online by researchers and
   their friends using social media platforms. ResultsA total of 1456
   participants completed the study questionnaire. Participants ages ranged
   from 10 to 60 years with a mean age of 26.9 +/- 12.4 years old. Exact
   585 (40.2\%) participants were males and 1270 (87.2\%) were from urban
   regions. A total of 657 (45.1\%) respondents reported using nasal
   decongestants while 799 (54.9\%) did not use NDC. As for the duration of
   use, 70.8\% used NDC for less than five days and 13.5\% used it for 5-15
   days. The most reported causes of using NDC were nasal obstruction
   (62.7\%) and common cold (25.7\%). ConclusionsIn conclusion, the study
   revealed that the frequency of using nasal decongestants was common
   (45.1\%) in the study. More efforts should be paid to improve public
   awareness regarding indications, duration of use, and method of using
   nasal decongestants to avoid rebound reactions that may affect patients'
   daily life activities.},

Title = {Hands-Up program: protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial
   of a combined 6-week exercise and education intervention in adults aged
   50-65 with a distal radius fracture},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Introduction This pilot study will determine the feasibility of
   recruitment, retention and adherence for the online combined exercise
   and education programme (Hands-Up) compared with usual care.
   Methods and analysis The proposed randomised controlled trial will be a
   pilot feasibility study with a 1:1 randomisation to the Hands-Up
   programme or usual physical therapy. The programme setting is an online
   home exercise and education program. Outcome assessments will take place
   at the Roth|McFarlane Hand and Upper Limb Clinic in London, Ontario,
   which is a tertiary care academic centre. 74 people aged 50-65 years
   after distal radius fracture will be recruited. Purposeful recruitment
   will be conducted to include a sufficient number of men in the study.
   The Hands-Up program includes both exercise and education. Participants
   will engage in approximately 45 min of a full-body home exercise routine
   followed by 30 min of education in an online program. The educational
   modules will focus on fall prevention, nutrition for osteoporosis and
   learning about osteoporosis. Participants will engage in the program
   online, twice a week for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
   6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome of the study is
   feasibility. The study will be considered feasible if participants
   attend >60\% of the sessions, 74 participants are enrolled in 12 months
   and >75\% of participants attend the final study visit. For the
   secondary outcome, physical and self-report outcomes will be assessed.
   Ethics and discussion This study has been approved by the institutional
   ethics review board. The viability of an online exercise and education
   program for people after distal radius fracture between the ages of 50
   and 65 will be evaluated in an attempt to help better prevent, diagnose
   and manage osteoporosis. This study will be disseminated through
   peer-reviewed publications, international conferences and social media.},

Abstract = {Background Epidemiological data on the prevalence of uninvestigated
   dyspepsia (UD) and its impact on the health-related quality of life
   (HRQOL) in Indonesian population are still lacking. There is no study
   investigating the association between exercise and the HRQOL in UD
   patients. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of UD and its
   association with physical exercise, and its impact on HRQOL in
   Indonesian patients with UD. Methods This was a population-based,
   cross-sectional study, conducted using an internet-based questionnaire
   which was randomly distributed throughout Indonesia using the social
   media. The questionnaire contained socio-demographic details, exercise
   levels, Rome III criteria for dyspepsia, and SF-NDI (Short Form-Nepean
   Dyspepsia Index). The frequency, duration, the intensity of exercise,
   and the classification of exercise according to ACSM (American College
   of Sports Medicine) were included in the assessment. The screening for
   UD was conducted using the Rome III criteria and the SF-NDI score was
   calculated to assess the HRQOL in patients with UD. Results A total of
   2725 valid responses were collected. The overall prevalence of UD in the
   study was 49.75\%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that
   gender (female) and lack of exercise were independently associated with
   UD (OR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.74-2.47, p < 0.001 and OR 1.72, 95\% CI
   1.42-2.07, p < 0.001). The median SF-NDI score among 1295 UD subjects in
   non-exercising and exercising groups was 21.00 and 18.00 (p < 0.001),
   respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated the prevalence of UD
   and the association between exercise and HRQOL among UD patients in
   Indonesia.},

Pages = {1158-1168},
Month = {2022 OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Hypothyroid patients often report dissatisfaction and poor
   quality of life. This survey explored the impact of hypothyroidism on
   patient satisfaction, everyday living, experiences with health care
   professionals, and influence of demographic and socioeconomic
   factors.Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey targeting an
   international population of hypothyroid patients. Multilevel regression
   modeling was used for analyses.Results: The total number of responses
   was 3915 from 68 countries. Satisfaction with care and treatment was not
   associated with type of treatment for hypothyroidism. Having no
   confidence and trust in health care professionals was strongly
   associated with dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Controlling for all other
   variables, significant differences were found among satisfaction rates
   between countries. A weak inverse relationship was found between
   satisfaction with care and treatment and impact on everyday living (p <
   0.001). Respondents taking levothyroxine (LT4) alone were more likely to
   report a positive impact on everyday living (pooled odds ratio 2.376
   {[}confidence interval: 0.941-5.997]) than respondents taking
   liothyronine-containing treatments.Conclusions: Low levels of
   satisfaction with care and treatment for hypothyroidism were strongly
   associated with lack of confidence and trust and negative experiences
   with health care professionals. Differences in responses between
   countries were noted, implying the potential influence of national
   health care systems, socioeconomic and cultural factors. Contrary to
   widespread anecdotes in social media, this large-scale survey shows no
   association between type of treatment for hypothyroidism and patient
   satisfaction, as well as better outcomes on everyday living associated
   with LT4, compared with liothyronine-containing treatments.},

Abstract = {Respiratory viruses that were suppressed through previous lockdowns
   during the COVID-19 pandemic have recently started to co-circulate with
   SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the clinical characteristics and
   symptomatology of different respiratory viral infections can help
   address the challenges related to the identification of cases and the
   understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variants' evolutionary patterns. Flu Watch
   (2006-2011) and Virus Watch (2020-2022) are household community cohort
   studies monitoring the epidemiology of influenza, respiratory syncytial
   virus, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, in England and
   Wales. This study describes and compares the proportion of symptoms
   reported during illnesses infected by common respiratory viruses. The
   SARS-CoV-2 symptom profile increasingly resembles that of other
   respiratory viruses as new strains emerge. Increased cough, sore throat,
   runny nose, and sneezing are associated with the emergence of the
   Omicron strains. As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, monitoring the evolution
   of its symptomatology associated with new variants will be critical for
   clinical surveillance.},

Title = {UK IBD Twin Registry: Concordance and Environmental Risk Factors of

Abstract = {Background and Aims Twin studies have long been used to infer
   heritability. Within the `omics era, twin cohorts have even greater
   research potential. This study describes the formation of the UK IBD
   Twin Registry and analysis of concordance and environmental factors.
   Method Twin pairs with IBD were recruited by advertising via IBD
   charities and social media, re-tracing a dormant IBD database and
   clinician referral. Details of zygosity, concordance, disease history
   and environmental factors were assessed. Pair concordance was
   calculated, and environmental factors were analysed with logistic
   regression models adjusted for zygosity and concordance. Results
   Ninety-one twin pairs were included in the analysis; forty-two with CD
   and forty-nine with UC. More MZ twin pairs with CD were concordant
   compared with DZ pairs, thus inferring heritability (Chi-sq. 15.6. P <
   0.001). In UC, MZ concordance was also numerically greater. Cigarette
   smoking was predictive of CD (OR 2.66, 95\% CI 1.16 to 6.07 P = 0.02);
   there may be an independent association with cannabis smoking (OR 2.59
   95\% CI 0.89 to 7.55 P = 0.08). Breastfeeding was protective against UC
   (OR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.25-0.93, P = 0.03), but not CD. Self-reports of less
   occurrences of gastroenteritis than peers were protective against future
   UC onset (OR 0.33 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.74, P = 0.01). Method of delivery,
   parental attitudes towards hygiene and recall of diet did not impact
   future IBD concordance. Conclusions This study supports the heritability
   of IBD. Twin study analysis was able to elucidate environmental factors
   associated with IBD.},

Title = {Association between Suicidal Behaviors in Adolescence and Negative
   Emotions, the Level of Stress, Stress Coping Strategies and the Quality
   of Sleep},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Suicidal behaviors in adolescents stem from complex processes deeply
   rooted in various spheres of life and functioning. The study was aimed
   at assessing the relationship between selected negative emotions, the
   quality of sleep, the level of perceived stress as well as stress coping
   strategies and suicidal ideation and attempts among high school
   students. The examined group consisted of adolescents aged 16-18
   recruited by social-media groups in Poland. The study was based on a
   diagnostic survey with the application of CAWI method. The other
   research tools applied in the study included: Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale-Modified, Perceived Stress Scale-10, How do you
   cope?-Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale as well as the authors' own
   questionnaire on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Anxiety,
   depression, aggression and insomnia as well as a high level of stress
   were statistically more common in girls than in boys (p < 0.001). The
   high level of negative emotions and insomnia, in turn, increased the
   risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 3.59, 95\% CI: 2.13-6.06 and OR = 2.35,
   95\% CI: 1.60-3.46), as well as suicide attempts (OR = 6.29, 95\% CI:
   2.93-14.80 and OR = 3.29, 95\% CI: 2.07-5.35). Additionally, high level
   of stress was associated with more than twice larger odds of suicidal
   ideation (OR = 2.26, 95\% CI: 1.13-4.63). Significantly higher
   prevalence of suicidal ideation (p = 0.017) and suicide attempts (p =
   0.016) was observed in girls. A high level of negative emotions and
   stress accompanied by a low quality of sleep are factors predisposing
   people to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide.},

Title = {Patient perspectives on the pathway to psoriatic arthritis diagnosis:
   results from a web-based survey of patients in the United States},
Journal = {BMC RHEUMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundThere are limited real-world data on the diagnostic
   experiences of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), including
   medical care sought and potential barriers to diagnosis. We aim to
   describe patient experiences related to receiving a PsA
   diagnosis.MethodsOurs was a mixed-method, 2-phase study. Phase 1
   comprised concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with clinical
   experts and adults diagnosed with PsA to develop a cross sectional,
   web-based survey. US adults with a self-reported PsA diagnosis were
   recruited through a patient support community (CreakyJoints), an online
   patient research registry (ArthritisPower), and social media outreach.
   In Phase 2, the online survey collected data on sociodemographics,
   clinical symptoms, disease burden, and diagnosis history of survey
   respondents with PsA.ResultsOf the 203 respondents included, 172
   (84.7\%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 51.6 (10.8) years. The
   time between seeking medical attention and receiving a diagnosis was
   <6months for 69 respondents, 6months to 4years for 68 respondents,
   and<greater than or equal to>5years for 66 respondents. Most respondents
   sought care from general practitioners (79.8\%) and rheumatologists
   (66.5\%). Common initial symptoms that led respondents to seek medical
   attention were joint pain (70.0\%) and stiffness (53.7\%). Among the
   initial symptoms that led respondents to seek care, joint pain, swollen
   joints, and sausage-like fingers or toes (indicating dactylitis) were
   more common among respondents with shorter time to diagnosis, whereas
   stiffness, fatigue, enthesitis (indicated by foot problems, tendon and
   ligament pain), and back pain were more common among respondents with
   longer time to diagnosis. Common misdiagnoses were psychosomatic issues
   (26.6\%) and osteoarthritis (21.7\%). Respondents with shorter times to
   diagnosis had lower frequencies of misdiagnosis.ConclusionsRespondents
   with PsA reported delays in diagnosis and misdiagnoses on their journey
   to a PsA diagnosis. Symptom differences, such as enthesitis and
   stiffness, were noted among respondents with shorter vs longer time to
   diagnosis. Increased understanding of diagnostic barriers may lead to
   earlier diagnosis and appropriate management to improve outcomes.},

Title = {Risk factors for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs participating
   in canine agility},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) is one of the most
   common causes of pelvic limb lameness in dogs. Risk factors for CCLR
   include breed (especially large and giant breeds), body weight, gender
   and spay/neuter status, and age. Few studies have evaluated physical
   activity and fitness indicators, however, as risk factors for disease.
   This study used an online questionnaire distributed primarily via social
   media to assess risk factors for CCLR in dogs actively engaged in
   agility training or competition to determine demographic and physical
   activity factors associated with rupture. Results Data from 260 dogs
   with CCLR were compared to similar data from 1006 dogs without CCLR. All
   dogs were actively training or competing in agility at the time of CCLR
   or the time of data submission, respectively. Physical characteristics
   associated with increased risk of CCLR included younger age, spayed
   female sex, greater body weight, and greater weight to height ratio.
   Agility activities associated with increased odds ratios included
   competition in events sponsored by the North American Dog Agility
   Council (NADAC), competing at novice and intermediate levels, and
   competing in fewer than 10 events/year. Odds ratios were lower in dogs
   that competed in events sponsored by United Kingdom Agility
   International (UKI). Other activities associated with increased odds
   ratio for CCLR included involvement in flyball activities and short
   walks or runs over hilly or flat terrain on a weekly basis. Activities
   associated with decreased odds ratio included involvement in dock
   diving, barn hunt, nosework, or lure coursing/racing activities and
   participation in core balance and strength exercises at least weekly.
   Conclusions These results are consistent with previous studies
   demonstrating that body weight and spay/neuter status are risk factors
   for CCLR in dogs. This is the first report to demonstrate that risk of
   CCLR in agility dogs is decreased in dogs that engage in regular core
   strengthening exercises, compete more frequently, compete at higher
   levels, and compete in more athletically challenging venues.},

   present epidemiological study measured various aspects of sleep
   disturbance such as sleep quality, daytime impairments, negative
   emotionality, sleep hygiene, and well-being associated with CoVID-19
   pandemic among the Indian population.
   Methods: This cross-sectional voluntary online survey (using Google
   form) was communicated across the country from 4th June to 3rd July 2020
   through mail and social media applications. The responses received (N =
   450) were categorized and validated using the latent class analysis and
   logistic regression tests respectively, and the classes and subclasses
   derived were profiled. These techniques are used for the first time in a
   CoVID-19 sleep study.
   Results: Out of the three classes derived from the LCA, people with
   severe dyssomnia belonging to class 1 (33.3\%) showed high daytime
   impairments, negative emotionality and high vulnerability towards
   CoVID-19 pandemic measures. In addition, the two subclasses derived from
   the severe dyssomnia group; one with negative emotionality predominance
   and the other with excessive daytime sleepiness, were similarly affected
   by CoVID-19 measures. People with moderate dyssomnia (class 2, 28.5\%)
   showed frequent arousals with daytime impairments and the majority
   (38.2\%) which fell in to class 3, the `no dyssomnia' category, were not
   impacted by CoVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusion: People with existing sleep problems or those who were
   vulnerable to the same were the ones affected by CoVID-19 pandemic.
   Those with inadequate emotional coping styles have showed heightened
   vulnerability. Proper medical and cognitive interventions are highly
   recommended for this population. No or moderate dyssomnia categories
   (class 3 and 2 respectively) were less impacted by CoVID-19. (C) 2021

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {High blood pressure is a worldwide problem and major global health
   burden. Whether alone or combined with other metabolic diseases, high
   blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study
   is a secondary data analysis from the National Health and Morbidity
   Survey 2015, a population-based study that was conducted nationwide in
   Malaysia using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. A total
   of 15,738 adults >= 18-years-old were recruited into the study, which
   reports the prevalence of hypertension stages among adults in Malaysia
   using the JNC7 criteria and determinants of its severity. The overall
   prevalence of raised blood pressure was 66.8\%, with 45.8\% having
   prehypertension, 15.1\% having Stage 1 hypertension, and 5.9\% having
   Stage 2 hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, a higher likelihood
   of having prehypertension was observed among respondents with advancing
   age, males (OR = 2.74, 95\% CI: 2.41-3.12), Malay ethnicity (OR = 1.21,
   95\% CI: 1.02-1.44), lower socioeconomic status, and excessive weight.
   The factors associated with clinical hypertension (Stages 1 and 2) were
   older age, rural residency (Stage 1 OR = 1.22, Stage 2 OR = 1.28), Malay
   ethnicity (Stage 2 OR = 1.64), diabetes (Stage 2 OR = 1.47),
   hypercholesterolemia (Stage 1 OR = 1.34, Stage 2 OR = 1.82), being
   overweight (Stage 1 OR = 2.86, Stage 2 OR = 3.44), obesity (Stage 1 OR =
   9.01, Stage 2 OR = 13.72), and lower socioeconomic status. Almost 70\%
   of Malaysian adults are at a risk of elevated blood pressure. The
   highest prevalence was in the prehypertension group, which clearly
   predicts a future incurable burden of the disease. Public health
   awareness, campaigns through mass and social media, and intervention in
   the work place should be a priority to control this epidemic.},

Title = {Change in screen time and overuse, and their association with
   psychological well-being among US-wide school-age children during the
   COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of the National Survey of Children's Health
   (NSCH) years 2018-21},
Journal = {CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background Previous studies on screen use and children's mental health
   during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic focused only on
   the timeframe during the pandemic, on children between narrow age
   ranges, only among a subset of children who have previously reported
   COVID-related severe family economic hardship or worries, or did not
   distinguish between instructive versus recreational device usage. Thus,
   in this study, we analyzed trends, specifically related to recreational
   screen use, and associations with psychological well-being (PWB) in the
   years before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic, among a wide range of
   school-aged children, widely across the nation. Methods Using the
   National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) years 2018-21, we analyzed a
   large random sample of school-aged children (6-17 years old) across the
   US (n = 88,823). We developed PWB issue scores (PWBIS) using
   self-reported measures relevant to this age group, and constructed
   regression models to assess the magnitude of the contribution of the
   pandemic on recreational screen use and PWB. Results The prevalence of
   recreational screen overuse and PWBIS increased significantly during the
   pandemic, compared to prior years. We also detected a notable effect of
   the pandemic on increased PWBIS, as well as its interaction term finding
   that it strengthened the association between screen time and PWBIS (p <
   0.01 across all regression models). Conclusions Accordingly, our results
   demonstrate the importance of the pandemic itself as an independent
   adverse factor and effect measure modifier for screen overuse and PWB
   more generally among all school-age children widely across the US. Our
   study used the most current data available, and future studies to
   evaluate whether these effects are persistent in the years after the
   pandemic are important.},

Title = {Stay-at-home, <i>Safe at Home</i>? A survey of parental home safety
   practices before and during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {SUPPL 1, 1, SI},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Background: To slow the spread of COVID-19, many nonessential
   businesses, daycares, and schools closed, and areas imposed
   ``stay-at-home `` orders. Closures led to young children spending more
   time at home, traditionally, the place where more than one-half of
   unintentional pediatric injuries occur. The objective of the current
   study was to describe parental safety perceptions and confidence, safety
   device purchase and installation, and injury prevention practices and
   behaviors, in homes with children 6 years of age and younger, before and
   during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a
   convenience sample of US participants, 18 years or older, was conducted
   from November 2020 to February 2021. Parents of children (<= 6 years)
   were recruited via social media ads and posts on Facebook and Twitter
   and invited to complete an anonymous, online survey about their home
   safety practices before and during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Upon
   completion, parents could participate in a prize drawing to receive one
   of five \$100 gift cards.Results: A total of 499 participants completed
   the survey. Most (47.9\%) were 45-54 years of age and reported the
   amount of time at home increased for them (93.9\%) and their children
   (90.6\%) during the stay-at-home period. Thirty-seven percent (36.9\%)
   of parents considered their homes safe but recognized room for
   improvement and felt confident in their ability to make their homes safe
   for their children (72.8\%). From the time before until the COVID-19
   stay-at-home orders were in place, parents increased their home injury
   prevention practices (42.3\%). Parents that had identified unsafe areas
   in the home before the stay-at-home order were significantly more likely
   to increase their safety behaviors, take childproofing actions, and
   purchase or install safety devices during the stay-at-home order (p <
   0.0001). Parents with younger children (5 years) were significantly more
   likely than parents with older children to take childproofing actions (p
   < .0001) including purchasing and installing safety devices (p <
   0.0001).Conclusions: Spending more time at home during the COVID-19
   pandemic may have helped the sampled parents, especially those with
   younger children, identify unsafe areas in their homes and encourage
   them to modify their behaviors, and purchase and install safety devices
   to help make their homes safer for their children.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {30-37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Social phobia is a common psychiatric disorder, and its
   onset happens usually around late adolescence period. Therefore, early
   diagnosis and its management is essential in any educational setting.
   Objectives: To identify university students with social phobia, to find
   out its determinants and to observe its impact on their quality of life.
   Methods: The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire.
   Social Phobia Inventory Questionnaire and Quality of Life Enjoyment and
   Satisfaction Questionnaire were used.
   Results: The mean age of the 450 student participants was 20.6 +/- 1.6
   years. Majority {[}312(69.3\%)] were males and majority {[}305(67.8\%)]
   were native of urban areas. Of the total, 169(37.6\%) were found to have
   social phobia. Among them, 114(67.5\%) had mild, 47(27.8\%) had moderate
   and 8(4.7\%) had severe social phobia. Family history of anxiety
   disorders (P=0.006), embarrassment with own socio-economic status
   (P=0.001) and past history of failure in academic examinations (P <
   0.001) were significantly associated with the presence of social phobia
   among the participants. Preference of interaction using social media
   instead of face to face communication with people (P=0.013), and by
   texting rather than calling the person (P=0.002) were seen significantly
   more among those with social phobia. The mean quality of life scores was
   found to be deteriorating significantly with increasing intensity of
   social phobia among students (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Social phobia was seen among more than one-third of the
   participants. Counselling centers are therefore required to address this
   problem at universities. This will also help to improve the quality of
   life and the socializing skills of those affected.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine what combinations of self-reported factors
   distinguish patellar tendinopathy (PT) from other knee problems, and
   explain PT severity variance.Design: Case-control study.Setting: Social
   media, private practice and National Health Service.Participants: An
   international sample of jumping athletes diagnosed with either PT (n =
   132; 30.7 +/- 8.9 years; 80 males; VISA-P= 61.6 +/- 16.0) or another
   musculoskeletal knee condition (n = 89; 31.8 +/- 9.9 years; 47 males;
   VISA-P= 62.9 +/- 21.2) by a clinician in the last 6 months.Main outcome
   measures: We considered clinical diagnosis (case = having PT vs control
   = having other knee problems) as the dependent variable. Severity and
   sporting impact were defined by VISA-P and availability,
   respectively.Results: A model comprising seven factors distinguished PT
   from other knee problems; training duration (OR = 1.10), sport type (OR
   = 2.31), injured side (OR = 2.28), pain onset (OR = 1.97), morning pain
   (OR = 1.89), condition acceptability (OR = 0.39) and swelling (OR =
   0.37). Sports-specific function (OR = 1.02) and player level (OR = 4.11)
   explained sporting availability. 44\% of PT severity variance was
   explained by quality of life (0 = 0.32), sports-specific function (0 =
   0.38) and age (0 =-0.17).Conclusion: Sports-specific, biomedical and
   psychological factors partially distinguish PT from other knee problems.
   Availability is mainly explained by sports-specific factors, while
   psychosocial factors impact on severity. Adding sports-specific and
   bio-psycho-social factors into assessments could help better
   iden-tification and management of jumping athletes with PT.(c) 2023 The

Title = {Restricted fluid bolus versus current practice in children with septic
   shock: the FiSh feasibility study and pilot RCT},
Journal = {HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {51},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: There has been no randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid
   bolus therapy in paediatric sepsis in the developed world despite
   evidence that excess fluid may be associated with harm.
   Objectives: To determine the feasibility of the Fluids in Shock (FiSh)
   trial - a RCT comparing restricted fluid bolus (10 ml/kg) with current
   practice (20 ml/kg) in children with septic shock in the UK.
   Design: (1) Qualitative feasibility study exploring parents' views about
   the pilot RCT. (2) Pilot RCT over a 9-month period, including integrated
   parental and staff perspectives study.
   Setting: (1) Recruitment took place across four NHS hospitals in England
   and on social media. (2) Recruitment took place across 13 NHS hospitals
   in England.
   Participants: (1) Parents of children admitted to a UK hospital with
   presumed septic shock in the previous 3 years. (2) Children presenting
   to an emergency department with clinical suspicion of infection and
   shock after 20 ml/kg of fluid. Exclusion criteria were receipt of > 20
   ml/kg of fluid, conditions requiring fluid restriction and the patient
   not for full active treatment (i.e. palliative care plan in place). Site
   staff and parents of children in the pilot were recruited to the
   perspectives study.
   Interventions: (1) None. (2) Children were randomly allocated (1 : 1) to
   10-or 20-ml/kg fluid boluses every 15 minutes for 4 hours if in shock.
   Main outcome measures: (1) Acceptability of FiSh trial, proposed consent
   model and potential outcome measures. (2) Outcomes were based on
   progression criteria, including recruitment and retention rates,
   protocol adherence and separation between the groups, and collection and
   distribution of potential outcome measures.
   Results: (1) Twenty-one parents were interviewed. All would have
   consented for the pilot study. (2) Seventy-five children were
   randomised, 40 to the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and 35 to the 20-ml/kg
   fluid bolus group. Two children were withdrawn. Although the anticipated
   recruitment rate was achieved, there was variability across the sites.
   Fifty-nine per cent of children in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and
   74\% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group required only a single trial
   bolus before shock resolved. The volume of fluid (in ml/kg) was 35\%
   lower in the first hour and 44\% lower over the 4-hour period in the
   10-ml/kg fluid bolus group. Fluid boluses were delivered per protocol
   (volume and timing) for 79\% of participants in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus
   group and for 55\% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group, mainly as a result
   of delivery not being completed within 15 minutes. There were no deaths.
   Length of hospital stay, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
   transfers, and days alive and PICU free did not differ significantly
   between the groups. Two adverse events were reported in each group. A
   questionnaire was completed by 45 parents, 20 families and seven staff
   were interviewed and 20 staff participated in focus groups. Although a
   minority of site staff lacked equipoise in favour of more restricted
   boluses, all supported the trial.
   Conclusions: Even though a successful feasibility and pilot RCT were
   conducted, participants were not as unwell as expected. A larger trial
   is not feasible in its current design in the UK.
   Future work: Further observational work is required to determine the
   epidemiology of severe childhood infection in the UK in the postvaccine
   era.},

Title = {Protocol for validation of the 4AT, a rapid screening tool for delirium:
   a multicentre prospective diagnostic test accuracy study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome of rapid
   onset, commonly precipitated by acute illness. It is common in older
   people in the emergency department (ED) and acute hospital, but greatly
   under-recognised in these and other settings. Delirium and other forms
   of cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, commonly coexist. There
   is a need for a rapid delirium screening tool that can be administered
   by a range of professional-level healthcare staff to patients with
   sensory or functional impairments in a busy clinical environment, which
   also incorporates general cognitive assessment. We developed the 4 `A's
   Test (4AT) for this purpose. This study's primary objective is to
   validate the 4AT against a reference standard. Secondary objectives
   include (1) comparing the 4AT with another widely used test (the
   Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)); (2) determining if the 4AT is
   sensitive to general cognitive impairment; (3) assessing if 4AT scores
   predict outcomes, including (4) a health economic analysis.
   Methods and analysis 900 patients aged 70 or over in EDs or acute
   general medical wards will be recruited in three sites (Edinburgh,
   Bradford and Sheffield) over 18 months. Each patient will undergo a
   reference standard delirium assessment and will be randomised to
   assessment with either the 4AT or the CAM. At 12 weeks, outcomes (length
   of stay, institutionalisation and mortality) and resource utilisation
   will be collected by a questionnaire and via the electronic patient
   record.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted in Scotland and
   England. The study involves administering tests commonly used in
   clinical practice. The main ethical issues are the essential recruitment
   of people without capacity. Dissemination is planned via publication in
   high impact journals, presentation at conferences, social media and the
   website www.the4AT.com.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
   is a global health emergency. Health Care Workers (HCWs) with sound
   knowledge and practices can help curb the pandemic. This study aimed to
   assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of HCWs about COVID-19 and
   compare physicians and non-physicians in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted among HCWs in Saudi Arabia in
   March and April 2020. Data were collected using a structured
   questionnaire having four sections including; socio-demographic and
   professional profile, knowledge, attitude and practices regarding
   COVID-19. Questionnaire link was sent through social media. Descriptive
   analysis was used for assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice and
   Chi-square test was used for comparing physicians and non-physicians.
   Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0.
   Results: A total of 398 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Only 45\% of
   the participants had correct knowledge about the agent while about 97\%
   knew that close contact with infected person is the most important risk
   factor. Only 63\% had correct knowledge about the role of antibiotics in
   COVID-19 treatment. Majority of the HCWs were worried and most
   frequently reported worry was risk to family. Carrying infection to home
   was most commonly reported fear, 92\%. Cleaning hands often or always
   was 11.5\% and 87\% respectively. About 71\% wore mask during work.
   Knowledge was better among physicians compared to non-physicians while
   attitude and practices were comparable between the two groups.
   Conclusion: We found that there was poor knowledge about causative agent
   and role of antibiotics for COVID-19 but for mode of transmission and
   prevention there was good knowledge. There were widely prevalent worries
   and fears among the participants. Overall, there were good infection
   control practices among the HCWs. Interventions are needed to improve
   knowledge and address worries and fears of HCW. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Title = {Using Digital Tools to Study the Health of Adults Born Preterm at a
   Large Scale: e-Cohort Pilot Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Background: Preterm birth is a global health concern. Its adverse
   consequences may persist throughout the life course, exerting a
   potentially heavy burden on families, health systems, and societies. In
   high-income countries, the first children who benefited from improved
   care are now adults entering middle age. However, there is a clear gap
   in the knowledge regarding the long-term outcomes of individuals born
   preterm.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting and
   following up an e-cohort of adults born preterm worldwide and provide
   estimations of participation, characteristics of participants, the
   acceptability of questions, and the quality of data collected.
   Methods: We implemented a prospective, open, observational, and
   international e-cohort pilot study (Health of Adult People Born
   Preterm-an e-Cohort Pilot Study {[}HAPP-e]). Inclusion criteria were
   being an adult (aged =18 years), born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation),
   having internet access and an email address, and understanding at least
   1 of the available languages. A large, multifaceted, and multilingual
   communication strategy was established. Between December 2019 and June
   2021, inclusion and repeated data collection were performed using a
   secured web platform. We provided descriptive statistics regarding
   participation in the e-cohort, namely, the number of persons who
   registered on the platform, signed the consent form, initiated and
   completed the baseline questionnaire, and initiated and completed the
   follow-up questionnaire. We also described the main characteristics of
   the HAPP-e participants and provided an assessment of the quality of the
   data and the acceptability of sensitive questions.
   Results: As of December 31, 2020, a total of 1004 persons had registered
   on the platform, leading to 527 accounts with a confirmed email and 333
   signed consent forms. A total of 333 participants initiated the baseline
   questionnaire. All participants were invited to follow-up, and 35.7\%
   (119/333) consented to participate, of whom 97.5\% (116/119) initiated
   the follow-up questionnaire. Completion rates were very high both at
   baseline (296/333, 88.9\%) and at follow-up (112/116, 96.6\%). This
   sample of adults born preterm in 34 countries covered a wide range of
   sociodemographic and health characteristics. The gestational age at
   birth ranged from 23+6 to 36+6 weeks (median 32, IQR 29-35 weeks). Only
   2.1\% (7/333) of the participants had previously participated in a
   cohort of individuals born preterm. Women (252/333, 75.7\%) and highly
   educated participants (235/327, 71.9\%) were also overrepresented. Good
   quality data were collected thanks to validation controls implemented on
   the web platform. The acceptability of potentially sensitive questions
   was excellent, as very few participants chose the ``I prefer not to
   say{''} option when available.
   Conclusions: Although we identified room for improvement in specific
   procedures, this pilot study confirmed the great potential for
   recruiting a large and diverse sample of adults born preterm worldwide,
   thereby advancing research on adults born preterm.},

Abstract = {Aim of the work: To investigate the frequency of fibromyalgia syndrome
   (FMS) among medical students and its stratifications. Patients and
   methods: The work included 513 medical students from Kafrelsheikh
   University. The 2010 and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
   fibromyalgia classification criteria were used to determine the presence
   of FMS. The chronic pain grade questionnaire was used to assess pain
   severity and impact on daily activities, recreational, social and family
   activities, and ability to work. Results: The students were 296 females
   (57.7 \%) and 217 males (42.3 \%). 64 (12.5 \%) fulfilled the 2010
   criteria (F:M 2.8:1) (p = 0.015). The frequency of female affection was
   15.9 \% (47/296) compared to 7.83 \% (17/217) in male. 37 (7.2 \%)
   fulfilled 2016 criteria and only six cases (9.3 \%) were known to have
   FMS. The frequency of FMS in students of the first 3 years (basic
   science) and the following 3 years (clinical) was 14.1 \% and 9.5 \%,
   respectively. Considering the chronic pain grade, there was a
   significant difference (p < 0.0001) in all pain items, daily
   recreational, social, family activities, and ability to work between
   those with and without FMS. 213 (41.5 \%) had knowledge about FMS and
   the source of their information was from social media (39.4 \%), their
   academic study (26.8 \%), web pages (25.4 \%) and friends (8.5 \%).
   Conclusion: Fibromyalgia is highly frequent among medical students,
   especially females of basic years with a high impact on recreational,
   social, family activities, and ability to work. Medical students should
   be considered a ``high-risk{''} group for FMS and should be educated
   about it and managed accordingly. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Publishing

Title = {Evaluation of medication adherence among patients with chronic diseases
   in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Number = {7},
Month = {2021 JUL},
Abstract = {Background Medication adherence in chronic diseases patients is a
   worldwide concern. Not achieving the goal of treatments because of
   non-adherence will lead to more complications and eventually may lead to
   death. In Saudi Arabia, we have insufficient data for interpretation.
   Hence, this study aims to have a better perspective at the number of the
   non-adherent patients with chronic diseases to their medications and its
   associated factors.
   Material and Method Cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted
   among chronic diseases patients living in Saudi Arabia throughout social
   media and hospital visits from August 2018 to April 2019. A
   three-section questionnaire consists of patient's health, medications
   and adherence characteristics. Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale
   (ARMS) was used to identify the level of adherence among chronic
   diseases patients. Univariate descriptive statistics and independent
   sample t-test with one-way ANOVA were used as bivariate analysis.
   Finally, significant predictors of medical adherence with adjusted
   coefficient were determined by multivariable linear regression.
   Results A total of 385 patients were included in the analysis for the
   current study. Overall, 96.62\% (n = 372) were non-adherent to their
   medications according to ARMS scale. Multiple linear regression model
   found types of co-morbidities, medication dosage form and dosage regimen
   to be independent predictors of medical adherence.
   Conclusion Medication adherence is alarmingly low among chronic disease
   patients in Saudi Arabia. There is a clear need for in-depth
   understanding for barriers. It is therefore important to conduct a
   qualitative study.
   What's newWhat's known
   Medication adherence is a critical factor in treatment success. Low
   adherence to the medication is a common problem among chronic disease
   patients. Moreover, the majority of the studies in Saudi Arabia showed
   low adherence rate, and it focused in one single chronic disease only
   despite that patient may have more.
   Most patients had more than one single chronic disease, so this study
   aims to take a snapshot to capture the adherence rate among patients who
   are suffering from chronic disease Saudi Arabia and its associated
   factors. This can help in understanding medication adherence behavior in
   clinical practice.},

Title = {Protocol for a 2-year longitudinal study of eating disturbances, mental
   health problems and overuse injuries in rock climbers (CLIMB)},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction Rock climbing is a rapidly growing sport in which
   performance may be affected by participant's weight and leanness, and
   there may be pressure on athletes with respect to their eating behaviour
   and body weight. However, there is sparse research performed on
   climbers, constituting a knowledge gap which the present study aims to
   fill. The primary outcomes of the study are to examine disordered eating
   and overuse injuries in rock climbers. Secondary variables are body
   image, indicators of relative energy deficiency, mental health problems,
   compulsive training, perfectionism, sleep quality and bone
   density.Method and analysis This prospective longitudinal study aims to
   recruit Swedish competitive rock climbers (>13 years) via the Swedish
   Climbing Federation. A non-athlete control group will be recruited via
   social media (n=equal of the climbing group). Data will be collected
   using streamlined validated web-based questionnaires with three
   follow-ups over 2 years. Inclusion criteria for rock climbers will be a
   minimum advanced level according to International Rock-Climbing Research
   Association. The non-athlete control group is matched for age and
   gender. Exclusion criteria are having competed at an elite level in any
   sport as well as training more often than twice per week. Statistical
   analyses will include multinominal logistic regression, multivariate
   analysis of variance (MANOVA) and structural equation modelling (SEM).
   We will assess effect measure modification when relevant and conduct
   sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of lost to follow-up.Ethics
   and dissemination The Rock-Climbers' Longitudinal attitudes towards
   Injuries, Mental health and Body image study, CLIMB, was approved by the
   Swedish ethics authority (2021-05557-01). Results will be disseminated
   through peer-reviewed research papers, reports, research conferences,
   student theses and stakeholder communications.},

Title = {Public Knowledge, Practice, and Attitude Regarding Cancer Screening: A
   Community-Based Study in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Cancer screening tests discover cancer at early stages,
   even before symptoms appear. When abnormal tissues or a malignant mass
   is found early, treatment and cure rates are improved. In late stages,
   the cancer may have grown and metastasized. This can negatively affect
   cancer treatment and reduce the overall survival rate. Screening tests
   are performed when a person is asymptomatic. Public awareness about
   cancer screening is crucial for the success of cancer screening programs
   and for consequently decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate due to
   cancer. (2) Aim: Assess the knowledge and perception of the community
   regarding cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. (3) Methodology: A
   descriptive cross-sectional study targeting the general population of
   Saudi Arabia was conducted from January to June 2022. The data were
   collected using a structured validated electronic questionnaire. The
   study questionnaire covered participants' personal data, medical
   history, source of data, and participants' knowledge, attitude, and
   practice items. The questionnaire was used as a digital survey and was
   distributed electronically to the target population. (4) Results: A
   total of 1313 participants completed the study questionnaire. The
   participants' ages ranged from 18 to 67 years, with a mean age of 28.3
   +/- 11.4 years old. Overall, 60.4\% of the study participants knew about
   cancer screening. Regarding the benefits of cancer screening, 91.8\% of
   the participants reported knowing that the early detection of cancer
   helps treatment, and 81.1\% knew that the early detection of cancer
   improves treatment outcomes. Moreover, 441 (33.6\%) of the participants
   had good knowledge regarding cancer and cancer screening, while 872
   (66.4\%) had poor levels of knowledge. Furthermore, 106 (8.1\%) of the
   participants underwent cancer screening. (5) Conclusions: The study
   results revealed that participants' awareness regarding cancer and
   cancer screening was low, especially for approaches to reduce cancer
   risk. Additionally, the study participants' practice regarding cancer
   screening was low. The health care authority should plan for
   population-based efficacious cancer screening programs. In addition,
   cancer screening information and the benefits of early detection can be
   disseminated through social media to target the desired populations.},

Abstract = {Background: COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) is associated with
   high morbidity and mortality. MUNCO is an international database used to
   collect clinical data on cases of CAM in real time. Preliminary data
   from the Mycotic Infections in COVID-19 (MUNCO) online registry yielded
   728 cases from May to September 2021 in four South Asian countries and
   the United States. A majority of the cases (694; 97.6\%) consisted of a
   mucormycosis infection. The dataset allowed for the analysis of the risk
   factors for adverse outcomes from CAM and this analysis is presented in
   this paper. Methods: The submission of cases was aided by a direct
   solicitation and social media online. The primary endpoints were full
   recovery or death measured on day 42 of the diagnosis. All patients had
   histopathologically confirmed CAM. The groups were compared to determine
   the contribution of each patient characteristic to the outcome.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were used to model the
   probability of death after a CAM diagnosis. Results: The registry
   captured 694 cases of CAM. Within this, 341 could be analyzed as the
   study excluded patients with an unknown CAM recovery status due to
   either an interruption or a lack of follow up. The 341 viable cases
   consisted of 258 patients who survived after the completion of treatment
   and 83 patients who died during the period of observation. In a
   multivariable logistic regression model, the factors associated with an
   increased risk of mortality include old age (OR = 1.04, 95\% CI
   1.02-1.07, p = 0.001), history of diabetes mellitus (OR 3.5, 95\% CI
   1.01-11.9, p = 0.02) and a lower BMI (OR 0.9, 95\% CI 0.82-0.98, p =
   0.03). Mucor localized to sinus disease was associated with 77\% reduced
   odds of death (OR = 0.23, 95\% CI 0.09-0.57, p = 0.001), while cerebral
   mucor was associated with an increased odds of death (OR = 10.96, 95\%
   CI 4.93-24.36, p = <= 0.0001). Conclusion: In patients with CAM, older
   age, a history of diabetes and a lower body mass index is associated
   with increased mortality. Disease limited to the sinuses without a
   cerebral extension is associated with a lower risk of mortality.
   Interestingly, the use of zinc and azithromycin were not associated with
   increased mortality in our study.},

Abstract = {Objective: The internet and social media, which have become a part of
   daily life, have also become critical sources for obtaining health
   information. Anyone can upload videos on any topic on Youtube; however,
   Youtube does not guarantee that the uploaded videos contain the correct
   information. Failure to use or the misuse of epinephrine auto-injectors
   (EAIs) can lead to fatal results. The aim of this study was analyze the
   reliability, understandability, and actionability of the videos on the
   use of epinephrine auto-injectors published on Youtube.Materials and
   Methods: The search term `how to use epinephrine auto-injectors' was
   searched on YouTubeTM (http://www.youtube. com) on 04.10.2022 and the
   first 200 videos were reviewed. Information about the video was recorded
   and the Global Quality Scale (GQS), DISCERN (DISCERN is a brief
   questionnaire that provides users with a valid and reliable way of
   assessing the quality of written information on treatment choices for a
   health problem) and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT)
   were evaluated.Results: Of the 112 videos, 86.6\% of those included in
   the study were educational for the public. The duration of
   understandable videos was found to be significantly higher than
   non-understandable videos (p<0.001). A moderately positive correlation
   was found between the GQS scores and understandability scores (p<0.001)
   and between actionability scores (p<0.001). A moderately positive
   correlation was found between the DISCERN scores and understandability
   (p<0.001) and actionability scores (p<0.001). The understandability rate
   of the videos uploaded by physicians and non-physician health workers
   was found to be significantly lower than the other video uploaders
   (p<0.01). In the performed linear regression analysis, it was seen that
   the number of understandable videos published by physicians and
   non-physician healthcare professionals was significantly lower than the
   videos uploaded by other users. The number of understandable videos was
   significantly higher in long videos.Conclusion: There are severe
   problems regarding the videos' quality, reliability, understandability
   and actionability. It is thought that Youtube content on the use of EAIs
   in case of anaphylaxis should be improved.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: One year after the novel coronavirus pandemic, there
   is a sustained risk of further global spread and most countries continue
   to impose preventive measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current situation outlined a specific
   reformulation of dental education in Medical University of Sofia, Sofia,
   Bulgaria - initial transition of face-to-face classes towards electronic
   learning (e-learning) processes, and subsequently, a transition from
   online teaching toward hybrid education. Therefore, the aim of the
   present study was to investigate preclinical dental students' knowledge
   and attitude towards COVID-19 precautions as well as crossinfection
   control strategies.
   METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted online on
   258 out of 516 preclinical dental students at the School of Dental
   Medicine, Sofia, using a self-administered questionnaire. Survey items
   were grouped in 3 general sections: educational experiences, students'
   knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 precautions and sources of
   relevant information as well as students' personal experiences during
   the current pandemic.
   RESULTS: A total of 169 students participated in the study (response
   rate: 65.5\%). Of them, 98 (57.9\%) were secondyear students, 42.6\%
   were men, and their mean age was 21 +/- 1 years. Almost one-third of the
   participants indicated violation of disinfection and sterilization
   protocols (28.9\%) and the presence of aerosol-generating procedures
   (27.2\%) as the most important COVID-19 predisposing factors in dental
   practice. Vaccination was suggested as the most effective way of
   prevention against the COVID-19. Proposed infection control practices
   included strict cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization (87.6\%),
   personal protective equipment (PPE) (85.8\%), frequent ventilation
   (53.3\%), and treatment after a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   (or other) test (46.2\%). Social media was considered as the main source
   for pandemic-related information (68.0\%).
   CONCLUSION: In the light of COVID-19, dental students demonstrated a
   satisfactory level of knowledge regarding standard precautions in dental
   practice; however, more attention should be paid to additional
   transmission-based precautions to ensure the safety of educational and
   working environment.},

Title = {Patients' Willingness and Perspectives Toward Chimeric Antigen Receptor
   T-Regulatory Cell Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases},
Journal = {CROHNS \& COLITIS 360},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Inflammatory bowel disease is a life-changing disease
   resulting from recurrent intestinal inflammation. Current therapies (eg,
   steroids and biologics) are associated with mild to severe side effects,
   and none provide a cure. Recent research has focused on genetically
   engineering gut-specific anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells
   (CAR-Tregs) to control intestinal inflammation, a logistically and
   conceptually complex approach. The purpose of our study was to
   understand patients' willingness to try CAR-Treg given 2 hypothetical
   scenarios-in a clinical trial or as a new treatment.
   Methods: We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about
   their willingness to try CAR-Treg. The online survey was developed using
   patient focus groups and associated literature. We recruited
   participants through email and social media. We used descriptive and
   inferential statistics to analyze closed-ended questions and inductive
   thematic analysis to analyze open-ended follow-up questions.
   Results: Survey participants indicated high willingness to try CAR-Treg
   therapy in both a clinical trial and as a new treatment. Willingness to
   try was not correlated with disease state or medication history. Women
   were less likely than men to indicate willingness to participate in a
   clinical trial. Participants' reasons for being willing to try CAR-Treg
   therapy included the wish to change their current treatment and the
   calling to participate in research. Participants that were not willing
   to try CAR-Treg mentioned the lack of long-term data and the success of
   their current therapy.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to investigate
   patient willingness to try CAR-Treg therapy. Our results demonstrate the
   promise of moving this therapy into clinical practice as most patients
   indicated willingness to try.
   Lay Summary
   We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about their
   willingness to try a new therapeutic approach currently developed in
   several research laboratories-chimeric antigen receptor-expressing
   T-regulatory cells-and found high willingness to try, independent of
   disease state or medication history.},

Abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death
   worldwide. Although knowledge regarding diagnosing and treating
   cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically, secondary prevention
   remains insufficiently implemented due to failure among affected
   individuals to adhere to guideline recommendations. This has continued
   to lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Involving patients in
   their healthcare and facilitating their active roles in their chronic
   disease management is an opportunity to meet the needs of the increasing
   number of cardiovascular patients. However, simple recall of advice
   regarding a more preventive lifestyle does not affect sustainable
   behavioral lifestyle changes. We investigate the effect of plaque
   visualization combined with low-threshold daily lifestyle tasks using
   the smartphone app PreventiPlaque to evaluate change in cardiovascular
   risk profile.Methods: and study design: This randomized, controlled
   clinical trial includes 240 participants with ultrasound evidence of
   atherosclerotic plaque in one or both carotid arteries, defined as focal
   thickening of the vessel wall measuring 50\% more than the regular
   vessel wall. A criterion for participation is access to a smartphone
   suitable for app usage. The participants are randomly assigned to an
   intervention or a control group. While both groups receive the standard
   of care, the intervention group has additional access to the
   PreventiPlaque app during the 12-month follow-up. The app includes daily
   tasks that promote a healthier lifestyle in the areas of smoking
   cessation, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet. The impact
   of plaque visualization and app use on the change in cardiovascular risk
   profile is assessed by SCORE2. Feasibility and effectiveness of the
   PreventiPlaque app are evaluated using standardized and validated
   measures for patient feedback. Ethics and dissemination: This clinical
   trial is approved by the ethics committee of the University of
   Duisburg-Essen (Germany). Study results will be disseminated at
   conferences and in peer -reviewed journals. Information regarding the
   PreventiPlaque app is available via print media, social media channels,
   and on the authors' websites.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEmerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for
   public health and the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019is a
   reemerging case of an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute
   Respiratory Syndrome-Corornavirus-2. Health care worker worldwide are at
   higher risk worldwide and the situation is the same in Nepal. The
   knowledge and attitude of health workers will certainly mark the outcome
   towards this pandemic. So, this study aims to assess the knowledge and
   attitude of community health workers towards the prevention of COVID-19
   virus.MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among
   the community health workers of various provinces of Nepal. A
   semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire was prepared in Google
   form and circulated to the sampled health workers through various social
   media platforms like face book, messenger, Instagram and g-mails. A
   total of 650 invitations were send and among them 420 responded and
   among them only 399 provided complete response. Responses containing
   anonymized data was collected analyzed in using SPSS-version-20. The
   results were interpreted and was checked with various demographic and
   enabling factors using chi-square test and logistic regression model.
   Also, ethical approval was taken from NHRC (Nepal Health Research
   Council (protocol registration number: 360/2020P) prior to the
   conduction of study.ResultsOut the total sample size of 450, we took 399
   responses taking into consideration all the inclusion criteria. So, from
   399 valid response, 230 (47.6\%) were males and 169 (42.4\%) were
   females. 380 (95.2\%) employed participants thought that wearing PPE
   will reduce the chances of getting COVID-19, majority of the
   participants 80.5\% (321) responded that COVID-19 will successfully be
   controlled and staffs receiving excellent support from palika had high
   knowledge level. Knowledge level was significantly associated with the
   enabling factor ``support from palika{''} (P =0.045).45.9\% of the
   respondents had no availability of COVID-19 response medical items for
   prevention of COVID-19 at their respective health facilities. Also the
   logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of knowledge level
   was 2 times higher (AOR=1.913 at 95\% CI: 1.266-2.891) compared to the
   female participants (Ref- female).ConclusionsProper and adequate
   knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 is a paramount in the prevention
   and control of SARS-COV-2. Health care workers are knowledgeable about
   COVID-19 and are proactively practicing the preventive measures to
   minimize the spread of infection but some lack optimistic attitude.
   Hence, the constantly updated educational programs related to COVID-19
   will surely contribute to improving the healthcare workers knowledge and
   attitude towards COVID-19.},

Title = {Promoting `testicular awareness': Co-design of an inclusive campaign
   using the World Café Methodology},
Journal = {HEALTH EXPECTATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {2024 FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction: Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged
   15-44 years in many countries. Most men with testicular cancer present
   with a lump. Testicular symptoms are more likely to occur secondary to
   benign diseases like epididymo-orchitis, a common sexually transmitted
   infection. Gender and sexual minorities are at an increased risk of
   testicular diseases and health disparities. The aim of this study was to
   co-design an inclusive community-based campaign to promote testicular
   awareness.Methods: This study uses the World Cafe methodology.
   Participation was sought from Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and
   Queer+ friendly organisations, testicular cancer survivors, health
   policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic designers.
   Participants engaged in three rounds of conversations to co-design the
   campaign. Data were collected using drawing sheets, artefact cards,
   sticky notes, coloured markers and a voice recorder. Deductive thematic
   analysis was conducted.Results: Seventeen individuals participated in
   the study. Six themes emerged from the analysis as follows: (i) online
   communication; (ii) offline communication; (iii) behavioural targeting
   and education; (iv) campaign frequency and reach; (v) demographic
   segmentation; and (vi) campaign identity. The use of social media for
   campaign delivery featured strongly in all conversations. Participants
   also recommended offline communication using posters and
   radio/television advertisements to scale up the campaign and achieve
   wider reach. Advertisements to overcome embarrassment surrounding
   testicular health were particularly recommended. Participants emphasised
   that campaign delivery must be dynamic whilst ensuring that the
   health-promoting messages are not diluted or lost. They stressed the
   importance of being inclusive and tailoring the campaign to different
   age groups, gender identities and sexual orientations.Conclusions: Study
   recommendations will be used to design and deliver the campaign. Future
   research will be needed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, cost
   and effect of the campaign on promoting testicular awareness and early
   detection of testicular diseases.Patient or Public Contribution: A
   participatory research approach was used to co-design the campaign with
   members of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ (LGBTQ+)
   friendly organisations, LGBTQ+ student bodies, LGBTQ+ staff networks,
   LGBTQ+ sports clubs, men's health organisations, testicular cancer
   survivors, health policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic
   designers.},

Title = {Individuals with currently untreated mental illness: causal beliefs and
   readiness to seek help},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {446-457},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aims. Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help.
   Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant
   for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the
   perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine
   whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness,
   perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near
   future.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons
   with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental
   illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (Mini
   International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The sample was recruited in
   the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal
   explanations for the present problem, depression literacy,
   self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for
   professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive
   symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression), and whether
   respondents had previously sought mental healthcare.
   Results. Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood
   disorder (n = 181, 87.4\%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and
   somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0\%) according to the ICD-10. N = 94
   (45.4\%) participants had never received mental health treatment
   previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal
   explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related
   causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour.
   Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related
   causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger
   self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never
   received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical
   causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking
   intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to
   person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need
   for professional help.
   Conclusions. While several causal explanations are associated with
   self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical
   attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and
   help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment
   experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and
   help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide
   help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that
   portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted
   to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for
   mental disorders.},

Title = {Exploring Abnormal Behavior Patterns of Online Users With Emotional
   Eating Behavior: Topic Modeling Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Background: Emotional eating (EE) is one of the most significant
   symptoms of various eating disorders. It has been difficult to collect a
   large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies
   of this symptom have been conducted. To provide adequate support for
   online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their
   behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system
   (PSS).
   Objective: This study aimed to analyze the behavior patterns of
   emotional eaters as the first step to designing a personalized
   intervention system.
   Methods: The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze
   behavioral data on EE. Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit,
   were analyzed. This dataset included all posts and feedback from July
   2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. In
   addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated.
   Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of
   90.64\% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users
   with EE behaviors. The expert group that labeled the dataset to train
   the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE
   diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. The
   experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0).
   Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA.
   Results: The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors
   were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic:
   addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for
   dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. The 5 main topics
   of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation,
   automatic bot feedback, and health information. The feedback topic
   distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior
   (overall P<.001).
   Conclusions: This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing
   behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors. We
   discovered the possibility of the LDA topic model as an exploratory user
   study method for abnormal behaviors in medical research. We also
   investigated the possibilities of ML- and topic modeling-based
   classifiers to automatically categorize text-based behavioral data,
   which could be applied to personalized medicine in future research.},

Title = {Relative Validity and Reproducibility of a New 44-Item Diet and Food
   Frequency Questionnaire Among Adults: Online Assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Dietary questionnaires currently available which can assess
   the habitual diet are timely, costly, or not adapted well to the modern
   diet; thus, there is a need for a shorter food frequency e-Questionnaire
   (FFeQ) adapted to Western diets, in order to properly estimate energy
   and macronutrient intakes or rank individuals according to food and
   nutrient intakes. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   relative validity and reproducibility of a 30-minute and 44-item FFeQ in
   a sample of adults obtained from the general population.
   Methods: A sample of French adults was recruited through social media
   and an advertising campaign. A total of 223 volunteers completed the
   FFeQ twice at one-year intervals and were included in the
   reproducibility study. During that interval, 92 participants completed
   three-to-six 24-hour recalls and were included in the validity study.
   Nutrient and dietary intakes were computed for all validity and
   reproducibility participants. The level of agreement between the two
   methods was evaluated for nutrient and food group intakes using
   classification into quintiles of daily intake, correlation coefficients
   and Bland-Altman plots.
   Results: For relative validity, correlation coefficients ranged from
   0.09 to 0.88 (unadjusted correlation coefficients, median: 0.48) and
   0.02 to 0.68 (deattenuated and energy adjusted correlation coefficients,
   median: 0.50) for food group and nutrient intakes, respectively. The
   median proportion of subjects classified into the same or adjacent
   quintile was 73\% and 66\% for food and nutrient intakes, respectively.
   Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement across the range of intakes.
   Regarding reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged
   from 0.33 to 0.72 (median: 0.60) and 0.55 to 0.73 (median: 0.64), for
   food and nutrient intakes, respectively.
   Conclusions: The FFeQ showed acceptable validity and reproducibility in
   a sample of adults based on their food and nutrient intakes. The FFeQ is
   a promising and low-cost tool that can be used in large-scale online
   epidemiological studies or clinical routines and could be integrated
   into evidence-based smartphone apps for assessing diet components.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationships between children's mobile gaming
   preferences, online risks, and mental health. Data were obtained from a
   sample of 2,702 third and fourth grade students from 16 elementary
   schools in Taiwan and 9 schools in China. A self-administered
   questionnaire was used. The mental state of the children who
   participated in the study was assessed using the Strengths and
   Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), while mobile gaming addiction was
   assessed using the short form of the Internet Gaming Disorders Scale
   (IGDS9-SF). The results showed that about 54\% of children played mobile
   games with others (multi-player), while 31\% played mobile games alone,
   and 15\% did not play mobile games. Multiple logistic regression results
   indicated that behaviors such as participating in multi-player games,
   playing violent games, a poor parent-child relationship, and living in a
   rural area were associated with a greater risk of mobile gaming
   addiction. Involvement in multi-player games, playing violent games,
   mobile gaming addiction, and exposure to mobile violence/pornography
   were associated with greater risks of cyber aggression/victimization.
   Multiple regression results showed that being a multi-player, playing
   violent games, mobile gaming addiction, exposure to
   violence/pornography, exposure to cyber aggression/victimization, and
   having a poor parent-child relationship were associated with emotional
   and behavioral problems.},

Abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization (WHO), reported that the most
   frequent vision problem is refractive error. It is experienced when the
   shape of the eye keeps light from focusing correctly on the retina.
   Refractive error proves to be a significant health issue as it is the
   most common cause of visual deterioration and the second leading cause
   of vision-loss internationally. There are many treatment modalities with
   public different preferences. Aim: to assess the awareness and attitude
   of the population with refractive error toward refractive correction
   methods particularly surgical procedures in Aseer region, Southern of
   Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study targeting
   general population who lives in Asser region with refractive error. Data
   were collected using pre-structured electronic questionnaire. The
   questionnaire was used as a digital survey and distributed to all
   participants in a private and anonymous manner. Question was designed to
   elicit information in concise and objective manner. In addition, logics
   were used in the question so the subsequent answer would base on prior
   response. Final questionnaire was uploaded online using social media
   platforms. Results: A total of 402 participants with refractive errors
   completed the study questionnaire. Participants' ages ranged from 16 to
   70 years with mean age of 30.1 +/- 12.9 years old. The most reported
   refractive error type was myopia (61.9\%) followed by astigmatism
   (23.6\%), and hyperopia (14.4\%). The most reported refractive error
   corrective method was spectacles (72.4\%), followed by refractive
   surgery (16.2\%), spectacles with lenses (9.2\%), and only lenses
   (2.2\%). Exact of 239 (59.5\%) of the study participants were aware of
   the surgical procedure for refractive error correction while a total of
   118 (29.4\%) of the study participants expect refractive surgeries to be
   dangerous. Conclusions: In conclusion, the current study revealed that
   myopia was the most reported refractive error and spectacles was the
   most used corrective method followed by surgery. Cosmetic issue with
   complications (eye infections) were the main factors behind refusing
   non-surgical modalities. Also, participants showed considerable
   awareness regarding surgical procedure and the attitude towards surgical
   approaches was not bad where vast majority think it is not dangerous.},

Title = {Identifying and Understanding Communities Using Twitter to Connect About
   Depression: Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: Depression is the leading cause of diseases globally and is
   often characterized by a lack of social connection. With the rise of
   social media, it is seen that Twitter users are seeking Web-based
   connections for depression.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify communities where Twitter users
   tweeted using the hashtag \#MyDepressionLooksLike to connect about
   depression. Once identified, we wanted to understand which community
   characteristics correlated to Twitter users turning to a Web-based
   community to connect about depression.
   Methods: Tweets were collected using NCapture software from May 25 to
   June 1, 2016 during the Mental Health Month (n=104) in the northeastern
   United States and Washington DC. After mapping tweets, we used a Poisson
   multilevel regression model to predict tweets per community (county)
   offset by the population and adjusted for percent female, percent
   population aged 15-44 years, percent white, percent below poverty, and
   percent single-person households. We then compared predicted versus
   observed counts and calculated tweeting index values (TIVs) to represent
   undertweeting and overtweeting. Last, we examined trends in community
   characteristics by TIV using Pearson correlation.
   Results: We found significant associations between tweet counts and
   area-level proportions of females, single-person households, and
   population aged 15-44 years. TIVs were lower than expected (TIV 1) in
   eastern, seaboard areas of the study region. There were communities
   tweeting as expected in the western, inland areas (TIV 2). Counties
   tweeting more than expected were generally scattered throughout the
   study region with a small cluster at the base of Maine. When examining
   community characteristics and overtweeting and undertweeting by county,
   we observed a clear upward gradient in several types of nonprofits and
   TIV values. However, we also observed U-shaped relationships for many
   community factors, suggesting that the same characteristics were
   correlated with both overtweeting and undertweeting.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Web-based communities, rather
   than replacing physical connection, may complement or serve as proxies
   for offline social communities, as seen through the consistent
   correlations between higher levels of tweeting and abundant nonprofits.
   Future research could expand the spatiotemporal scope to confirm these
   findings.},

Abstract = {A key aspect of the Web Science conference is exploring the ethical
   challenges of technologies, data, algorithms, platforms, and people in
   the Web as well as detecting, preventing and predicting anomalies in web
   data including algorithmic and data biases. Handling Web Bias (HWB) is a
   new workshop focusing on best practices for identifying and handling web
   bias. Awareness of the problems of algorithmic and data bias has been
   growing but even with careful review of the algorithms and data sets, it
   may not be possible to delete all unwanted bias, particularly when
   systems learn from historical data that encodes cultural biases. This
   workshop will take a rich and cross-domain approach to this complicated
   problem, providing a venue for researchers to move beyond awareness of
   the problem of algorithmic and data bias to focus on practical
   strategies for handling it.
   HWB'19 is a three-quarter-day workshop including two keynotes and a
   session of discussion papers.
   The first keynote is from Alan Mislove, professor in the Khoury College
   of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. He will speak about
   ``Measuring bias in social network ad targeting and delivery{''}.
   The second keynote is from Jean Garcia-Gathright, a research scientist
   at Spotify. She will speak about ``Fair machine learning in industry:
   from research to practice{''}.
   We also have a session highlight two discussion papers. First, Nina
   Cesare and Elaine Nsoesie from the Department of Global Health at Boston
   University along with Christian Grant from the Department of Computer
   Science at the University of Oklahoma will present their work
   ``Understanding Demographic Bias and Representation in Social Media
   Health Data{''}. Second, Taha Hassan from the Department of Computer
   Science at Virginia Tech will present his work ``On Bias in Social
   Reviews of University Courses{''}.
   In recent years, a collection of workshops and conferences have been
   founded to explore issues of fairness, accountability, transparency and
   ethics as they intersect with research in a diverse set of technical
   areas (e.g., FAT-ML to explore issues of fairness, accountability and
   transparency in machine learning, FAT-IR to explore these issues in
   information retrieval and others). Many of these emerging venues have
   been highly multi-disciplinary bringing together researchers from
   computing, law, policy, ethics, anthropology and art. Given the
   fundamentally multi-disciplinary nature of the Web Science conference,
   we hope the Handling Web Bias workshop will provide a vibrant venue to
   discuss these important issues within the Web Science community.

Title = {Advancing cluster randomised trials in children's therapy: a survey of
   the acceptability of trial behaviours to therapists and parents},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Background Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological
   interventions in children's therapy are rare. This is, in part, due to
   the challenges of the acceptability of common trial designs to
   therapists and service users. This study investigated the acceptability
   of participation in cluster randomised controlled trials to therapists
   and service users. Methods A national electronic survey of UK
   occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language
   therapists, service managers, and parents of children who use their
   services. Participants were recruited by NHS Trusts sharing a link to an
   online questionnaire with children's therapists in their Trust and with
   parents via Trust social media channels. National professional and
   parent networks also recruited to the survey. We aimed for a sample size
   of 325 therapists, 30 service managers, and 60 parents. Trial
   participation was operationalised as three behaviours undertaken by both
   therapists and parents: agreeing to take part in a trial, discussing a
   trial, and sharing information with a research team. Acceptability of
   the behaviours was measured using an online questionnaire based on the
   Theoretical Framework of Acceptability constructs: affective attitude,
   self-efficacy, and burden. The general acceptability of trials was
   measured using the acceptability constructs of intervention coherence
   and perceived effectiveness. Data were collected from June to September
   2020. Numerical data were analysed using descriptive statistics and
   textual data by descriptive summary. Results A total of 345 survey
   responses were recorded. Following exclusions, 249 therapists and 40
   parents provided data which was 69.6\% (289/415) of the target sample
   size. It was not possible to track the number of people invited to take
   the survey nor those who viewed, but did not complete, the online
   questionnaire for calculation of response rates. A completion rate
   (participants who completed the last page of the survey divided by the
   participants who completed the first, mandatory, page of the survey) of
   42.9\% was achieved. Of the three specified trial behaviours, 140/249
   (56.2\%) therapists were least confident about agreeing to take part in
   a trial. Therapists (135/249, 52.6\%) reported some confidence they
   could discuss a trial with a parent and child at an appointment. One
   hundred twenty of 249 (48.2\%) therapists reported confidence in sharing
   information with a research team through questionnaires and interviews
   or sharing routine health data. Therapists (140/249, 56.2\%) felt that
   taking part in the trial would take a lot of effort and resources.
   Support and resources, confidence with intervention allocation, and
   sense of control and professional autonomy over clinical practice were
   factors that positively affected the acceptability of trials. Of the 40
   parents, twelve provided complete data. Most parents (18/40, 45\%)
   agreed that it was clear how trials improve children's therapies and
   outcomes and that a cluster randomised trial made sense to them in their
   therapy situation (12/29, 30\%). Conclusions Using trials to evaluate
   therapy interventions is, in principle, acceptable to therapists, but
   their willingness to participate in trials is variable. The willingness
   to participate may be particularly influenced by their views related to
   the burden associated with trials, intervention allocation, and
   professional autonomy.},

Abstract = {Background: In many parts of the world, including Brazil, uptake for
   biomedical interventions has been insufficient to reverse the HIV
   epidemic among key populations at high risk for HIV, including men who
   have sex with men. Young MSM (YMSM), particularly Black YMSM, have high
   HIV incidence, low viral suppression, and low preexposure prophylaxis
   (PrEP) uptake and adherence. Therefore, novel approaches to increase the
   HIV biomedical interventions uptake by YMSM are urgently needed.
   Objective: We describe the Conectad@s Project, which aims to: (1)
   estimate the prevalence and incidence of HIV and other sexually
   transmitted infections, the onset of sexual risk behavior, and barriers
   to biomedical interventions among YMSM aged 18 to 24 years in Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil; and (2) conduct a technology-based adherence
   intervention study to promote a rapid linkage of YMSM to HIV care or
   prevention, and support and sustain adherence.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey will be conducted with 400 YMSM
   recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) adapted for social
   media-based sampling, preceded by a formative phase. HIV and sexually
   transmitted infections testing will be conducted, including early HIV
   infection biomarker detection. Behavioral, partnership, network, and
   structural measures will be collected through structured questionnaires.
   All individuals recruited for the survey will have access to HIV risk
   assessment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, prevention counseling,
   and a technology-based adherence intervention. Those who accept the
   adherence intervention will receive weekly text messages via a social
   networking app (WhatsApp) for 24 weeks, with follow-up data collected
   over 48 weeks.
   Results: The Conectad@s project has been approved by our local
   institutional review board (\#CAAE 26086719.0.0000.4262) in accordance
   with all applicable regulations. Questionnaires for the RDS survey and
   intervention were developed and tested in 2020, formative interviews
   were conducted in January and February 2021 to guide the development of
   the RDS, and enrollment is planned to begin in early 2022.
   Conclusions: The Conectad@s Project is a vanguard study that, for the
   first time, will apply digital RDS to sample and recruit YMSM in Brazil
   and rapidly connect them to ART, PrEP, or prevention counseling through
   a technology-based adherence intervention. RDS will allow us to estimate
   HIV prevalence among YMSM and measure HIV infection biomarkers in the
   context of the onset of risky behavior. The data will lay the groundwork
   to adapt and implement HIV prevention strategies, identify barriers to
   the earliest HIV infection diagnosis, immediate ART or PrEP initiation,
   and detect new clusters of HIV transmission.},

Title = {Bayesian reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions highlights
   substantial proportion of negative serial intervals},
Journal = {EPIDEMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Month = {2023 SEP},
Abstract = {Background: The serial interval is a key epidemiological measure that
   quantifies the time between the onset of symptoms in an
   infector-infectee pair. It indicates how quickly new generations of
   cases appear, thus informing on the speed of an epidemic. Estimating the
   serial interval requires to identify pairs of infectors and infectees.
   Yet, most studies fail to assess the direction of transmission between
   cases and assume that the order of infections -and thus transmissions
   -strictly follows the order of symptom onsets, thereby imposing serial
   intervals to be positive. Because of the long and highly variable
   incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, this may not always be true (i.e an
   infectee may show symptoms before their infector) and negative serial
   intervals may occur. This study aims to estimate the serial interval of
   different SARS-CoV-2 variants whilst accounting for negative serial
   intervals. Methods: This analysis included 5 842 symptomatic individuals
   with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst 2 579 households from
   September 2020 to August 2022 across England \& Wales. We used a
   Bayesian framework to infer who infected whom by exploring all
   transmission trees compatible with the observed dates of symptoms, based
   on a wide range of incubation period and generation time distributions
   compatible with estimates reported in the literature. Serial intervals
   were derived from the reconstructed transmission pairs, stratified by
   variants.Results: We estimated that 22\% (95\% credible interval (CrI)
   8-32\%) of serial interval values are negative across all VOC. The mean
   serial interval was shortest for Omicron BA5 (2.02 days, 1.26-2.84) and
   longest for Alpha (3.37 days, 2.52-4.04).Conclusions: This study
   highlights the large proportion of negative serial intervals across
   SARS-CoV-2 variants. Because the serial interval is widely used to
   estimate transmissibility and forecast cases, these results may have
   critical implications for epidemic control.},

Title = {Different temperature thresholds for antipyretic intervention in
   critically ill children with fever due to infection: the FEVER
   feasibility RCT},
Journal = {HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Fever accelerates host immune system control of pathogens
   but at a high metabolic cost. The optimal approach to fever management
   and the optimal temperature thresholds used for treatment in critically
   ill children are unknown.
   Objectives: To determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive
   randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness
   and cost-effectiveness of different temperature thresholds for
   antipyretic management.
   Design: A mixed-methods feasibility study comprising three linked
   studies -(1) a qualitative study exploring parent and clinician views,
   (2) an observational study of the epidemiology of fever in children with
   infection in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and (3) a pilot RCT
   with an integrated-perspectives study.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from (1) four hospitals in England
   via social media (for the FEVER qualitative study), (2) 22 PICUs in the
   UK (for the FEVER observational study) and (3) four PICUs in England
   (for the FEVER pilot RCT).
   Participants: (1) Parents of children with relevant experience were
   recruited to the FEVER qualitative study, (2) patients who were
   unplanned admissions to PICUs were recruited to the FEVER observational
   study and (3) children admitted with infection requiring mechanical
   ventilation were recruited to the FEVER pilot RCT. Parents of children
   and clinicians involved in the pilot RCT.
   Interventions: The FEVER qualitative study and the FEVER observational
   study had no interventions. In the FEVER pilot RCT, children were
   randomly allocated (1 : 1) using research without prior consent (RWPC)
   to permissive (39.5 degrees C) or restrictive (37.5 degrees C)
   temperature thresholds for antipyretics during their PICU stay while
   mechanically ventilated.
   Main outcome measures: (1) The acceptability of FEVER, RWPC and
   potential outcomes (in the FEVER qualitative study), (2) the size of the
   potentially eligible population and the temperature thresholds used (in
   the FEVER observational study) and (3) recruitment and retention rates,
   protocol adherence and separation between groups and distribution of
   potential outcomes (in the FEVER pilot RCT).
   Results: In the FEVER qualitative study, 25 parents were interviewed and
   56 clinicians took part in focus groups. Both the parents and the
   clinicians found the study acceptable. Clinicians raised concerns
   regarding temperature thresholds and not using paracetamol for
   pain/discomfort. In the FEVER observational study, 1853 children with
   unplanned admissions and infection were admitted to 22 PICUs between
   March and August 2017. The recruitment rate was 10.9 per site per month.
   The majority of critically ill children with a maximum temperature of
   >37.5 degrees C received antipyretics. In the FEVER pilot RCT, 100
   eligible patients were randomised between September and December 2017 at
   a recruitment rate of 11.1 per site per month. Consent was provided for
   49 out of 51 participants in the restrictive temperature group, but only
   for 38 out of 49 participants in the permissive temperature group. A
   separation of 0.5 degrees C (95\% confidence interval 0.2 degrees C to
   0.8 degrees C) between groups was achieved. A high completeness of
   outcome measures was achieved. Sixty parents of 57 children took part in
   interviews and/or completed questionnaires and 98 clinicians took part
   in focus groups or completed a survey. Parents and clinicians found the
   pilot RCT and RWPC acceptable. Concerns about children being in
   pain/discomfort were cited as reasons for withdrawal and non-consent by
   parents and non-adherence to the protocol by clinicians.
   Limitations: Different recruitment periods for observational and pilot
   studies may not fully reflect the population that is eligible for a
   definitive RCT.
   Conclusions: The results identified barriers to delivering the
   definitive FEVER RCT, including acceptability of the permissive
   temperature threshold. The findings also provided insight into how these
   barriers may be overcome, such as by limiting the patient inclusion
   criteria to invasive ventilation only and by improved site training. A
   definitive FEVER RCT using a modified protocol should be conducted, but
   further work is required to agree important outcome measures for
   clinical trials among critically ill children.},

Title = {Characterizing mood disorders in the AFFECT study: a large,
   longitudinal, and phenotypically rich genetic cohort in the US},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {There has recently been marked progress in identifying genetic risk
   factors for major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD); however,
   few systematic efforts have been made to elucidate heterogeneity that
   exists within and across these diagnostic taxa. The Affective disorders,
   Environment, and Cognitive Trait (AFFECT) study presents an opportunity
   to identify and associate the structure of cognition and symptom-level
   domains across the mood disorder spectrum in a prospective study from a
   diverse US population. Participants were recruited from the 23andMe, Inc
   research participant database and through social media; self-reported
   diagnosis of MD or BD by a medical professional and medication status
   data were used to enrich for mood-disorder cases. Remote assessments
   were used to acquire an extensive range of phenotypes, including mood
   state, transdiagnostic symptom severity, task-based measures of
   cognition, environmental exposures, personality traits. In this paper we
   describe the study design, and the demographic and clinical
   characteristics of the cohort. In addition we report genetic ancestry,
   SNP heritability, and genetic correlations with other large cohorts of
   mood disorders. A total of 48,467 participants were enrolled: 14,768
   with MD, 9864 with BD, and 23,835 controls. Upon enrollment, 47\% of
   participants with MD and 27\% with BD indicated being in an active mood
   episode. Cases reported early ages of onset (mean = 13.2 and 14.3 years
   for MD and BD, respectively), and high levels of recurrence (78.6\% and
   84.9\% with >5 episodes), psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication
   use. SNP heritability on the liability scale for the ascertained MD
   participants (0.19-0.21) was consistent with the high level of disease
   severity in this cohort, while BD heritability estimates (0.16-0.22)
   were comparable to reports in other large scale genomic studies of mood
   disorders. Genetic correlations between the AFFECT cohort and other
   large-scale cohorts were high for MD but not for BD. By incorporating
   transdiagnostic symptom assessments, repeated measures, and genomic
   data, the AFFECT study represents a unique resource for dissecting the
   structure of mood disorders across multiple levels of analysis. In
   addition, the fully remote nature of the study provides valuable
   insights for future virtual and decentralized clinical trials within
   mood disorders.},

Title = {Social listening - revealing Parkinson's disease over day and night},
Journal = {BMC NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Background Nocturnal symptoms in Parkinson's disease are often treated
   after management of daytime manifestations. In order to better
   understand the unmet needs of nocturnal symptoms management, we analyzed
   the characteristics and burden of nocturnal symptoms from patients'
   perspectives and explored their changes over time. Overall symptoms
   (occurring at day or night) were collected to compare whether the unmet
   needs related to nocturnal symptoms and to overall symptoms are
   different. Methods We used a Social Listening big-data technique to
   analyze large amounts of Parkinson's disease symptoms in dialogues
   available from social media platforms in 2016 to 2018. These symptoms
   were classified as either overall symptoms or nocturnal symptoms. We
   used share of voice (SOV) of symptoms as a proportion of total dialogues
   per year to reflect the characteristics of symptoms. Negative sentiment
   score of symptoms was analyzed to find out their related burden. Results
   We found the SOV for overall motor symptoms was 79\% and had not
   increased between 2016 and 2018 (79\%, p = 0.5). The SOV for non-motor
   symptoms was 69\% and had grown by 7\% in 2018 (p < 0.01). The SOV for
   motor complications was 9\% and had increased by 6\% in 2018 (p < 0.01).
   The SOV of motor symptoms was larger than non-motor symptoms and motor
   complications (p < 0.01). The SOV of non-motor symptoms was larger than
   motor complications (p < 0.01). For nocturnal symptoms, 45\% of the
   analyzed PD population reported nocturnal symptoms in 2018, growing by
   6\% (p < 0.01). The SOV for nocturnal-occurring motor symptoms was
   higher than most non-motor symptoms. However, non-motor symptoms had the
   higher increases and evoked higher negative sentiment regardless of
   whether they occurred during the day or night. For symptoms that can
   occur at either day or night, each nocturnal symptom was rated with a
   higher negative sentiment score than the same symptom during the day.
   Conclusions The growing SOV and the greater negative sentiment of
   nocturnal symptoms suggest management of nocturnal symptoms is an unmet
   need of patients. A greater emphasis on detecting and treating nocturnal
   symptoms with 24-h care is encouraged.},

Title = {Incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus post COVID-19 vaccination: A
   cross-sectional study in India},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {2022 MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Introduction: Several sociodemographic variables, including ethnic
   inequality, have been identified as potentially influencing the uptake
   of COVID-19 vaccinations. To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at
   least 70-85\% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation
   with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We
   designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals
   and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the
   clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
   post-vaccination.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May
   10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated
   semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study
   subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data
   and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using
   Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as
   WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are
   actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social
   distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and
   comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and
   side effects were collected.
   Results: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the
   majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25-34 years
   (38.6\%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7\% had received
   Covishield and 17.8\% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1\% have received
   both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9\% had received
   only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated
   individuals had a gap of 4-5 weeks for the second dose (37.1\%) followed
   by 5-6 weeks (11.2\%). Post-vaccination 50.8\% had experienced muscle
   pain, 46\% had experienced fatigue, 36.5\% weakness, and 12.3\% back
   pain. Among vaccinated 26\% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and
   44.5\% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non
   -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated
   individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the
   second time experienced either through vaccination or infection
   demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the
   antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening
   complications.
   Conclusion: Although more than 50\% of the vaccinated individuals
   experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high
   acceptance rate (74\%) of vaccination among the participants. The
   vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to
   the non-vaccinated individuals.},

Title = {Using Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Assess the Adopt Intention
   of a Proposed IoT-Based Health Management Tool},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Advancements in IoT technology contribute to the digital progress of
   health science. This paper proposes a cloud-centric IoT-based health
   management framework and develops a system prototype that integrates
   sensors and digital technology. The IoT-based health management tool can
   collect real-time health data and transmit it to the cloud, thus
   transforming the signals of various sensors into shared content that
   users can understand. This study explores whether individuals in need
   tend to use the proposed IoT-based technology for health management,
   which may lead to the new development of digital healthcare in the
   direction of sensors. The novelty of this research lies in extending the
   research perspective of sensors from the technical level to the user
   level and explores how individuals understand and adopt sensors based on
   innovatively applying the IoT to health management systems. By
   organically combining TAM with MOA theory, we propose a comprehensive
   model to explain why individuals develop perceptions of usefulness, ease
   of use, and risk regarding systems based on factors related to
   motivation, opportunity, and ability. Structural equation modeling was
   used to analyze the online survey data collected from respondents. The
   results showed that perceived usefulness and ease of use positively
   impacted adoption intention, Perceived ease of use positively affected
   perceived usefulness. Perceived risk had a negative impact on adoption
   intention. Readiness was only positively related to perceived
   usefulness, while external benefits were positively related to perceived
   ease of use and negatively related to perceived risk. Facilitative
   conditions were positively correlated with perceived ease of use and
   negatively correlated with perceived risk. Technical efficacy was
   positively related to perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.
   Overall, the research model revealed the cognitive mechanism that
   affects the intention of individuals to use the system combining sensors
   and the IoT and guides the digital transformation of health science.},

Title = {A Task-Technology-Identity Fit Model of Smartwatch Utilisation and User
   Satisfaction: A Hybrid SEM-Neural Network Approach},

Year = {2023},

Month = {2023 APR},
Abstract = {Smartwatches are wearable devices intended to be smartphone companions
   that capture health data and ease access to notifications. They have
   also become personalisable standing as a fashion statement. This
   combination resulted in staggering adoption rates recently leading to
   question whether smartwatch users' choice and use satisfaction emerge
   from utility features or from its fashion characteristics. This paper
   proposes and validates a fit theory to investigate the antecedents of
   adopters' satisfaction. Besides evaluating fit with identity, the model
   assesses both perceived and actual task-technology fit of smartwatches.
   A questionnaire-based quantitative approach is used to collect data from
   about 300 smartwatch users in Qatar. To test the proposed model, data is
   analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural
   networks (ANN). Furthermore, ANN sensitivity analysis ranks the
   importance of the fit factors affecting users' choice during pre- and
   post-adoption stages. Both task-technology and technology-identity fit
   factors are quasi-equally important in explaining 62\% of satisfaction
   variance. ANN analysis revealed that post-adoption satisfaction is
   primarily attributed to smartwatches' ability to fit with users'
   identity and secondarily to its perceived fit with tasks. Nevertheless,
   pre-adoption choice of smartwatches is mainly guided by their
   functionality. This paper is the first to propose and validate an
   integrated task-technology-identity fit model to explain smartwatch
   utilization and users' satisfaction. The originality also lies in
   assessing actual task-technology fit and as perceived by users.
   Employing two modes of analysis revealed extra insights too.},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to implement
   telepsychiatry across practice models. Objective: We sought to evaluate
   the overall success of this change and to identify what types of
   practice settings, provider groups, and patient groups were best served
   by telepsychiatry and telepsychotherapy utilization. We were
   particularly inter-ested in how providers of consultation-liaison
   psychiatry adapted to remote care. Methods: An anonymous provider survey
   querying demographics, education, training, technological experience,
   practice setting, treatment modalities, patient groups, transition
   process, and outcomes was made openly available via social media and
   professional listservs. We used multivariable regression modeling to
   evaluate for predictors of the positive outcomes of overall
   satisfaction, subjective ability to diagnose and treat patients
   adequately using exclusively telepsychiatric platforms, and patient
   satisfaction by proxy. Results: Three hundred thirty-three respondents,
   mostly young (59.4\% younger than 50 years), female (69.7\%), and
   physicians (67.9\%), completed the survey. One hundred ninety-seven
   (59.1\%) worked in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Of the total, 85.9\%
   gave affirmative answers to overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear
   regression models found that satisfaction was predicted by general
   comfort with technology (P < 0.001), but negatively correlated with
   having technical issues (P < 0.001), a priori skepticism (P < 0.001),
   clinician being male (P = 0.004), and treating LGBTQ+ patients (P =
   0.022). Completeness was associated with having training in tele-health
   (P = 0.039) and general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) but
   negatively associated with treating LGBTQ+ patients (P = 0.024) or
   inpatients (P = 0.002). Patient satisfaction by proxy was positively
   associated with general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) and the
   respondent being a nonphysician (P = 0.004) and negatively associated
   with encountering a technical issue (P = 0.013) or treating inpatients
   (P = 0.045). Consultation-liaison psychiatrists had similar results
   overall and were more likely to have other staff assist in making
   televisits effective (mean {[}standard deviation]: -1.25 {[}3.57] versus
   -2.76 {[}3.27], P < 0.001) especially if consultative (mean {[}standard
   deviation]: -0.87 {[}3.67] versus -2.39 {[}3.01], P = 0.010).
   Conclusions: This study suggests high rates of overall satisfaction in
   telepsychiatry adoption, even in consultation -liaison psychiatry. There
   is distinct benefit in bolstering training, providing technical support,
   and addressing skepticism. Future research should include patient
   surveys and control groups and should focus on vulnerable populations
   such as sexual and gender minorities.},

Title = {Use of nutritional food labels and consumers' confidence in label
   information},
Journal = {REVISTA DE NUTRICAO-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {Objective
   This investigation evaluated the use of food labels and consumers'
   perception of the reliability of food labels nutritional information.
   Methods
   This is a transversal exploratory quantitative investigation, carried
   out in Curitiba, Brazil. A total of 536 students from a public
   institution participated in the survey answering a structured
   questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact
   test were performed considering a significance level of 5\%.
   Results
   The participants' mean age was 21.11 +/- 2.83 years, and 59.3\% were
   female. It was noticed that 41.6\% of consumers used the nutritional
   information sometimes and 14.7\% always, mainly because they liked to
   know what they were buying and consuming (35.8\%). Lack of patience
   (29.5\%) and concern about the composition of the food purchased
   (34.2\%) were the main reasons for not using the information provided.
   commonly used nutrition claim was ``trans fat-free{''} (42.5\%) and the
   type of food in which nutrition labeling was used most was milk and
   dairy products (42.0\%). Frequent use of nutritional information was
   higher among women (p<0.01) and among those who practice physical
   activity (p=0.04). Many individuals relied on food labels nutritional
   information (61.9\%), but out of these, 43.6\% did not use that
   information at the time of purchase. There was no difference between
   respondents' confidence in the information, sociodemographic and health
   data.
   Conclusion
   Many people still do not use the label nutrition information. Efforts
   should be made to change this scenario. Changes in nutrition labeling
   can help modify this situation, with the use of clearer label
   information, more easily understood, that does not raise any doubts in
   the consumers' mind.},

Title = {Is It Just About Physical Health? An Online Cross-Sectional Study
   Exploring the Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jordan
   in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Background
   Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at
   national and international levels were directed to mitigate the spread
   of the disease and its physical harm, paying less attention to the
   psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at
   early stages of the pandemic. Objectives
   This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological
   distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii)
   Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university
   students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered
   questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using
   the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions
   have explored our study's second and third aims. Results
   A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis.
   Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2\%).
   The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning
   distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe
   psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5\%). 209 students (54.9\%) reported
   that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic
   regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity
   and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as
   protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age
   (aOR = 0.64, P = 0.022; 95\% CI: 0.44-0.94), and having a strong
   motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, P = 0.048; 95\% CI:
   0.01-0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, P = 0.049;
   95\% CI: 1.10-3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR
   = 2.49, P = 0.007; 95\% CI: 1.29-4.80) acted as risk factors for having
   higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most
   common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media
   platforms (n = 269, 70.6\%), and 209 students (54.9\%) reported distance
   learning as their most distressing concern. Conclusion
   The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the
   mental health of individuals, including students. We recommend a
   nationwide psychological support program to be incorporated into
   Jordan's preparedness plan and response strategy in combating the
   COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Background Network meta-analysis (NMA) is increasingly used in guideline
   development and other aspects of evidence-based decision-making. We
   aimed to develop a risk of bias (RoB) tool to assess NMAs (RoB NMA
   tool). An international steering committee recommended that the RoB NMA
   tool to be used in combination with the Risk of Bias in Systematic
   reviews (ROBIS) tool (i.e. because it was designed to assess biases
   only) or other similar quality appraisal tools (eg, A MeaSurement Tool
   to Assess systematic Reviews 2 {[}AMSTAR 2]) to assess quality of
   systematic reviews. The RoB NMA tool will assess NMA biases and
   limitations regarding how the analysis was planned, data were analysed
   and results were presented, including the way in which the evidence was
   assembled and interpreted. Objectives Conduct (a) a Delphi process to
   determine expert opinion on an item's inclusion and (b) a knowledge user
   survey to widen its impact. Design Cross-sectional survey and Delphi
   process. Methods Delphi panellists were asked to rate whether items
   should be included. All agreed-upon item were included in a second round
   of the survey (defined as 70\% agreement). We surveyed knowledge users'
   views and preferences about the importance, utility and willingness to
   use the RoB NMA tool to evaluate evidence in practice and in
   policymaking. We included 12 closed and 10 open-ended questions, and we
   followed a knowledge translation plan to disseminate the survey through
   social media and professional networks. Results 22 items were entered
   into a Delphi survey of which 28 respondents completed round 1, and 22
   completed round 2. Seven items did not reach consensus in round 2. A
   total of 298 knowledge users participated in the survey (14\% respondent
   rate). 75\% indicated that their organisation produced NMAs, and 78\%
   showed high interest in the tool, especially if they had received
   adequate training (84\%). Most knowledge users and Delphi panellists
   preferred a tool to assess both bias in individual NMA results and
   authors' conclusions. Response bias in our sample is a major limitation
   as knowledge users working in high-income countries were more
   represented. One of the limitations of the Delphi process is that it
   depends on the purposive selection of experts and their availability,
   thus limiting the variability in perspectives and scientific
   disciplines. Conclusions This Delphi process and knowledge user survey
   informs the development of the RoB NMA tool.},

Title = {BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE AND THE LIFE SCIENCES},
Booktitle = {ETHICS AND INTEGRITY IN HEALTH AND LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH},
Series = {Advances in Research Ethics and Integrity},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {63-83},
Abstract = {Big Data analysis is one of the key challenges to the provision of
   health care to emerge in the last few years. This challenge has been
   spearheaded by the huge interest in the ``4Ps{''} of health care
   (predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory). Big Data
   offers striking development opportunities in health care and life
   sciences. Healthcare research is already using Big Data to analyze the
   spatial distribution of diseases such as diabetes mellitus at detailed
   geographic levels. Big Data is also being used to assess
   location-specific risk factors based on data of health insurance claims.
   Other studies in systems medicine utilize bioinformatics approaches to
   human biology which necessitate Big Data statistical analysis and
   medical informatics tools. Big Data is also being used to develop
   electronic algorithms to forecast clinical events in real time, with the
   intent to improve patient outcomes and thus reduce costs.
   Yet, this Big Data era also poses critically difficult ethical
   challenges, since it is breaking down the traditional divisions between
   what belongs to public and private domains in health care and health
   research. Big Data in health care raises complex ethical concerns due to
   use of huge datasets obtained from different sources for varying
   reasons. The clinical translation of this Big Data is thus resulting in
   key ethical and epistemological challenges for those who use these data
   to generate new knowledge and the clinicians who eventually apply it to
   improve patient care.
   Underlying this challenge is the fact that patient consent often cannot
   be collected for the use of individuals' personal data which then forms
   part of this Big Data. There is also the added dichotomy of healthcare
   providers which use such Big Data in attempts to reduce healthcare
   costs, and the negative impact this may have on the individual with
   respect to privacy issues and potential discrimination.
   Big Data thus challenges societal norms of privacy and consent. Many
   questions are being raised on how these huge masses of data can be
   managed into valuable information and meaningful knowledge, while still
   maintaining ethical norms. Maintaining ethical integrity may lack behind
   in such a fast-changing sphere of knowledge. There is also an urgent
   need for international cooperation and standards when considering the
   ethical implications of the use of Big Data-intensive information.
   This chapter will consider some of the main ethical aspects of this
   fast-developing field in the provision of health care, health research,
   and public health. It will use examples to concretize the discussion,
   such as the ethical aspects of the applications of Big Data obtained
   from clinical trials, and the use of Big Data obtained from the
   increasing popularity of health mobile apps and social media sites.},

Abstract = {This study was aimed to discuss the predictive value of infectious
   disease dynamics model (IDD model) and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)
   for scenario deduction of public health emergencies (PHEs). Based on the
   evolution law of PHEs and the meta-scenario representation of basic
   knowledge, this study established a DBN scenario deduction model for
   scenario deduction and evolution path analysis of PHEs. At the same
   time, based on the average field dynamics model of the SIR network, the
   dimensionality reduction process was performed to calculate the epidemic
   scale and epidemic time based on the IDD model, so as to determine the
   calculation methods of threshold value and epidemic time under emergency
   measures (quarantine). The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) epidemic was
   undertaken as an example to analyze the results of DBN scenario
   deduction, and the infectious disease dynamics model was used to analyze
   the number of reproductive numbers, peak arrival time, epidemic time,
   and latency time of the COVID epidemic. It was found that after the M1
   measure was used to process the S1 state, the state probability and the
   probability of being true (T) were the highest, which were 91.05 and
   90.21, respectively. In the sixth stage of the development of the
   epidemic, the epidemic had developed to level 5, the number of infected
   people was about 26, and the estimated loss was about 220 million yuan.
   The comprehensive cumulative foreground (CF) values of O1 similar to O3
   schemes were -1.34, -1.21, and -0.77, respectively, and the final CF
   values were -1.35, 0.01, and-0.08, respectively. The final CF value of
   O2 was significantly higher than the other two options. The household
   infection probability was the highest, which was 0.37 and 0.35 in Wuhan
   and China, respectively. Under the measures of home quarantine, the
   numbers of confirmed cases of COVID in China and Wuhan were 1.503 (95\%
   confidential interval (CI) = 1.328 similar to 1.518) and 1.729 (95\% CI
   = 1.107 similar to 1.264), respectively, showing good fits with the real
   data. On the 21st day after the quarantine measures were taken, the
   number of COVID across the country had an obvious peak, with the
   confirmed cases of 24495, and the model prediction value was 24085 (95\%
   CI = 23988 similar to 25056). The incubation period 1/q was shortened
   from 8 days to 3 days, and the number of confirmed cases showed an
   upward trend. The peak period of confirmed cases was advanced,
   shortening the overall epidemic time. It showed that the prediction
   results of scenario deduction based on DBN were basically consistent
   with the actual development scenario and development status of the
   epidemic. It could provide corresponding decisions for the prevention
   and control of COVID based on the relevant parameters of the infectious
   disease dynamic model, which verified the rationality and feasibility of
   the scenario deduction method proposed in this study. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {Dissemination and exploitation of knowledge regarding affordable
   clinical skills and innovative precision medicine, two current topics in
   active development in medicine, may contribute to improve also sepsis
   management. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a
   dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is strongly related to
   all body organs or to systemic diseases and to the quality of the
   best-practice in use, which is particularly critical in surgical or
   intervention techniques. Trauma, surgical and mini-invasive procedures,
   vascular or endoscopic interventions, otolaryngology,
   obstetrics-gynecological and urological procedures, malnutrition,
   dental, skin, chronic liver, kidney and respiratory disease are
   frequently involved. Accordingly, apart from the clinical risk analysis
   and management of the process of care, the actual factors that may be
   easily neglected are the techniques used, the personal skills of the
   health professionals and the quality of the equipment. The quest for
   biomarkers consistent with the unmet needs of medical doctors and of
   their patient and the efforts for overcoming bacterial antibiotic
   resistances are currently the main foci of medical research. In
   addition, in this regard, research and innovation would benefit from
   greater knowledge, skills and use of bioinformatics and omics. The
   caveats related to in-silico approaches must be flagged: algorithms may
   equally warrant scientific innovations or hide the lack of them; a
   patient is more than a set of covariates. Epidemiology and prevention
   includes all the actions suitable for achieving an adequate hygiene and
   immunization of populations and for safer hospital policies and
   procedures during Patients' stays. In any subset, the most unresolved
   critical point in sepsis is a timely diagnosis. This is impaired by low
   degrees of suspicion for the possibility of emerging sepsis, by the
   shortage of use of the simplest microbiological testing but, equally or
   more, by the insufficient diffusion of non-invasive imaging skills
   suitable to detect and monitor the emerging sites and sources of
   infection. In primary care, in emergency facilities, in hospital wards
   and in intensive care units, inclusion of appropriate knowledge, skills,
   expertise and imaging equipment must be extended as much as possible.
   The low cost of UltraSound machines and of increasing bioinformatics
   literacy by e-learning, makes such investments affordable even in
   limited-resources contexts. Frontier educational and best practice
   intervention enhancing affordable clinical skills and innovative
   precision medicine may lead beyond the boundaries of fatal outcomes in
   sepsis.},

Title = {Using Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Monitor Behavioral Changes
   During COVID-19},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background: In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for
   COVID-19, countries have adopted nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
   such as social distancing and full lockdown. An objective and
   quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of
   these interventions at a local level is needed.
   Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed
   open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and
   Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and
   response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID -19.
   Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable
   devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited
   in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We
   derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home,
   maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of
   Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing),
   step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock
   duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests
   followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features
   among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also
   studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational
   background.
   Results: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at
   home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled
   devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all
   five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility
   features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were
   more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United
   Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy,
   Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around
   major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate
   (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later
   (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and
   slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also
   found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the
   lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant
   difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home,
   the low BMI group walked more.
   Conclusions: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform
   leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to
   rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in
   response to public health interventions as a result of infectious
   outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to
   implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local
   compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help
   countries ease out of lockdown.},

Abstract = {The associations between digital media use and mental well-being among
   children and adolescents have been inconclusive. We examined (i) the
   associations between digital media use and mental health outcomes,
   anxiety, depression, and ADHD, (ii) whether family resilience and
   neighborhood factors attenuate the associations, and (iii) whether sleep
   mediates these associations. We used the National Survey of Children's
   Health data from 2019 to 2020. A total of 45,989 children's (6-17 years)
   data were analyzed in this study. Multivariate logistic regression was
   used to assess the associations between digital media use and anxiety,
   depression, and ADHD. Path models and Paramed command in STATA were used
   to test the role of sleep as a mediator of these associations. The
   prevalence of heavy digital media users (who spent 4 or more hours per
   day) among the analytic sample was 30.52\%, whereas anxiety was 13.81\%,
   depression was 5.93\%, and ADHD was 12.41\%. Children in the heavy media
   user group had 63\% increased odds of anxiety (95\% CI: 1.32-2.01) and
   99\% increased odds of depression (95\% CI: 1.35-2.94) after adjusting
   for sociodemographic factors, compared to the children in light media
   user group (who spent < 2 h per day), and these relations were
   significant at 0.01 level. However, family resilience and community
   factors significantly attenuated the effect of digital media use on
   anxiety and depression. Sleep did not mediate the associations between
   digital media use and anxiety or depression.Conclusions: Family
   resilience and neighborhood factors protect against the harmful effects
   of digital media use. Further research is needed to examine the
   relationships of media contents, the presence of electronic devices in
   bedrooms, and sleep quality with mental health.},

Abstract = {Aims This study aims to replicate Przybylski and Weinstein (Psychol Sci
   28(2):204-215, 2017), using a large population cohort to examine the
   validity of the proposed Goldilocks Hypothesis, which states that
   moderate digital media engagement may be beneficial and that both high
   and low usage may have a negative relationship with mental wellbeing.
   Methods Using the GUI98 cohort, we used separate weekday and weekend
   time-based categorical variables indicating time spent online, playing
   video games, watching TV/films as well as a frequency variable
   indicating multiscreening, and their associations with SDQ internalizing
   and externalizing symptoms using linear and quadratic regression
   parameters. We followed procedures for confounder adjustments outlined
   in Przybylski and Weinstein (Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017).
   Results As hypothesized by the Goldilocks Hypothesis, time spent online
   watching TV/films at the weekend and multiscreening all had curvilinear
   relationships with internalizing and externalizing symptoms with
   significantly higher symptoms for no time as well as for higher
   exposures. internalizing and externalizing symptoms increased with time
   spent playing video games.
   Conclusions This brief report supports the Goldilocks Hypothesis, that
   suggests that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically
   harmful and may instead be beneficial, even necessary in a world
   becoming ever more increasingly reliant on digital media (Przybylski and
   Weinstein in Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017).},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus, Vietnam introduced its first
   national partial lockdown on April 1st, 2020. The public relied on
   online sources, whether through official websites or phone-based
   applications, to acquire up-to-date health information, provide accurate
   instructions, and limit misinformation. This study aims to provide
   insight regarding the current level of awareness of the pandemic, and to
   identify associated factors in Vietnamese participants to recommend
   necessary interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a
   web-based survey during the first week of the lockdown period. There
   were 341 observations collected using a snowball sampling technique. A
   Tobit multivariable regression model was used to identify factors
   associated with the demand for each category of health information. The
   most requested information was the latest updated news on the epidemic,
   followed by information about disease symptoms and updated news on the
   outbreak. The prevalence of diverse socioeconomic, demographic, and
   ethnic factors in Vietnam requires consideration of the specific health
   information needs of unique groups. Identifying group-specific demands
   would be helpful to provide proper information to fulfill each
   population group's needs.},

Title = {Public Interest in Acne on the Internet: Comparison of Search
   Information From Google Trends and Naver},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background: Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease primarily affecting
   young adults. Given that the internet has become a major source of
   health information, especially among the young, the internet is a
   powerful tool of communication and has a significant influence on
   patients.
   Objective: This study aimed to clarify the features of patients'
   interest in and evaluate the quality of information about acne vulgaris
   on the internet.
   Methods: We compared the search volumes on acne vulgaris with those of
   other dermatological diseases using Google Trends from January 2004 to
   August 2019. We also determined the search volumes for relevant keywords
   of acne vulgaris on Google and Naver and evaluated the quality of
   answers to the queries in KnowledgeiN.
   Results: The regression analysis of Google Trends data demonstrated that
   the patients' interest in acne vulgaris was higher than that for other
   dermatological diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (beta=-20.33, 95\% CI
   -22.27 to -18.39, P<.001) and urticaria (beta=-27.09, 95\% CI -29.03 to
   -25.15, P<.001) and has increased yearly (beta=2.38, 95\% CI 2.05 to
   2.71, P<.001). The search volume for acne vulgaris was significantly
   higher in the summer than in the spring (beta=-5.04, 95\% CI -9.21 to
   -0.88, P=.018) and on weekends than on weekdays (beta=-6.68, 95\% CI
   -13.18 to -0.18, P=.044). The most frequently searched relevant keywords
   with ``acne vulgaris{''} and ``cause{''} were ``stress,{''} ``food,{''}
   and ``cosmetics.{''} Among food, the 2 highest acne vulgaris-related
   keywords were milk and wheat in Naver and coffee and ramen in Google.
   The queries in Naver KnowledgeiN were mostly answered by a Korean
   traditional medicine doctor (53.4\%) or the public (33.6\%), but only
   12.0\% by dermatologists.
   Conclusions: Physicians should be aware of patients' interest in and
   beliefs about acne vulgaris to provide the best patient education and
   care, both online and in the clinic.},

Abstract = {Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a global burden on public health;
   it has been ranked as the second common cancer worldwide, with 1.3
   million new cases in 2018. Developed countries have a higher incidence
   than in developing countries. Because of the lack of studies on PCa in
   Saudi Arabia, our study aims to measure the awareness about PCa and
   knowledge of PCa screening practices among men in Medina, Jeddah, and
   Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study conducted
   among males in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from 2(nd) to
   10(th) July 2020, using a validated questionnaire. The sample size was
   1212 participants. Data collected through an online questionnaire. All
   data analyses performed using (SPSS) software, using the Chi-square test
   for bivariate analysis. All levels of significance were set at P < 0.05.
   Results: We collected 1212 completed surveys, with mean ages of 36 years
   (standard deviation 12.77). We found that 77\% of participants heard
   about PCa, and 52.5\% heard about PCa screening tests. This study showed
   that only 10.6\% of all participants had good knowledge, 41.9\% had fair
   knowledge, and 47.5\% had poor knowledge. Only 3.9\% of participants had
   experienced the prostate-specific antigen test. Conclusion: The study
   showed that the level of knowledge of PCa is low. Thus, community and
   individuals should collaborate to increase awareness by having more
   awareness campaigns, disseminating the information through the media,
   and encouraging men to do screening tests as indicated. In addition,
   including more Saudi Arabia cities in future studies is preferable to
   have more precise outcomes.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Due to the extended lockdown imposed for SARS-CoV-2
   pandemic, many people have experienced problematic sleep patterns and
   associated health issues worldwide. This study was conducted to assess
   the sleep quality and psychological states of the Bangladeshi population
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, respondent's behavioral traits as well as
   psychological or sleep-related problems induced self-medication practice
   among the respondents, along with the probability of development of drug
   dependency.
   Methods: The survey was conducted among 2941 respondents from 25th
   November 2020 to 4th December 2020 where the responses were analyzed by
   SPSS V22.
   Results: 10-29.5\% experienced a significant degree of sleep problems
   whereas some experienced severe anxiety and depression. The associations
   between the behavioral traits and parameters concerning sleep quality,
   anxiety and depression showed 5\% level of significance in all cases.
   Self-medication practice of sleep aids during this pandemic was reported
   by 7.14\% of the respondents, with a greater percentage belonging to the
   female or senior age group. Tendency to repeatedly self-medication was
   observed in 18.86\% of this self-medicating populace, and a greater
   number of male (10.26\%) respondents displayed such tendency as opposed
   to their female (8.6\%) equivalents. However, 48.10\% of the respondents
   reported perceptions of improved physical and/or psychological health
   following self-medication, and this trait was predominant in men
   (52.14\%).
   Conclusion: Results showed a significant number of Bangladeshi populaces
   were suffering from psychological issues during this COVID-19 which also
   influenced a certain number of people towards self-medication practice
   where signs of drug dependency were observed in a significant number of
   respondents.},

Abstract = {Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognised as
   being responsible for a substantial proportion of the global burden of
   disease. Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for
   patients with TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on
   this patient population. We aimed to characterise differences in
   casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency
   neurosurgery for TBI across different levels of human development.
   Methods We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive
   patients with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience
   sample of hospitals identified by open invitation, through international
   and regional scientific societies and meetings, individual contacts, and
   social media. Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each
   hospital's 30-day study period were all eligible for inclusion, with the
   exception of patients undergoing insertion of an intracranial pressure
   monitor only, ventriculostomy placement only, or a procedure for
   drainage of a chronic subdural haeinatoma. The primary outcome was
   mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation if
   the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were
   stratified according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite
   of life expectancy, education, and income measures-into very high HDI,
   high HDI, medium HDI, and low HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic
   regression was used to examine the effect of HDI on mortality while
   accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and between-country
   variation.
   Findings Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57
   countries, collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20\%)
   records were from countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33\%) from
   countries in the high HDI tier, 614 (38\%) from countries in the medium
   HDI tier, and 154 (9\%) from countries in the low HDI tier. The median
   age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the oldest patients in the very high
   HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the youngest in the low HDI
   tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common procedures were
   elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69
   {[}45\%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the
   medium HDI tier (189 {[}31\%]) and high HDI tier (173 {[}32\%]), and
   evacuation of a supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high
   HDI tier (155 {[}47\%]). Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h
   (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 18\% (299 of 1635). After adjustment
   for casernix, the odds of mortality were greater in the medium HDI tier
   (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.84, 95\% CI 1.55-5.2) and high HDI tier (2.26,
   1.23-4.15), but not the low HDI tier (1.66, 0.61-4.46), relative to the
   very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in
   mortality (median OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.17-2.49).
   Interpretation Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI
   differed considerably in their admission characteristics and management
   across human development settings. Level of human development was
   associated with mortality. Substantial opportunities to improve care
   globally were identified, including reducing delays to surgery.
   Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests changes at an
   institutional level could influence outcome and comparative
   effectiveness research could identify best practices. Copyright The

Abstract = {BackgroundMental health problems and mental health related mortality
   have increased among adolescents, particularly girls. These trends have
   implications for etiology and prevention and suggest new and emerging
   risk factors in need of attention. The present study estimated age,
   period, and cohort effects in depressive symptoms among US nationally
   representative samples of school attending adolescents from 1991 to
   2018.MethodsData are drawn from 1991 to 2018 Monitoring the Future
   yearly cross-sectional surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students
   (N=1,260,159). Depressive symptoms measured with four questions that had
   consistent wording and data collection procedures across all 28years.
   Age-period-cohort effects estimated using the hierarchical
   age-period-cohort models.ResultsAmong girls, depressive symptoms
   decreased from 1991 to 2011, then reversed course, peaking in 2018;
   these increases reflected primarily period effects, which compared to
   the mean of all periods showed a gradual increase starting in 2012 and
   peaked in 2018 (estimate=1.15, p<0.01). Cohort effects were minimal,
   indicating that increases are observed across all age groups. Among
   boys, trends were similar although the extent of the increase is less
   marked compared to girls; there was a declining cohort effect among
   recently born cohorts, suggesting that increases in depressive symptoms
   among boys are slower for younger boys compared to older boys in recent
   years. Trends were generally similar by race/ethnicity and parental
   education, with a positive cohort effect for Hispanic girls born
   1999-2004.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are increasing among teens,
   especially among girls, consistent with increases in depression and
   suicide. Population variation in psychiatric disorder symptoms highlight
   the importance of current environmental determinants of psychiatric
   disorder risk, and provide evidence of emerging risk factors that may be
   shaping a new and concerning trend in adolescent mental health.},

Abstract = {Purpose Internet use is common among people with suicidal feelings and a
   considerable amount of suicide help material is available online.
   Despite attempts to promote formal help sites (e.g. governmental and
   charity sector) in internet search results, users' evaluation of these
   sites is lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to explore distressed
   users' perceptions of formal online help and their experiences of using
   this in times of crisis. Methods In-depth interview study of 53 adults
   reporting suicide-related internet use. Results While highly valued in
   relation to general mental health problems, formal sites were not
   perceived to meet the different needs of those experiencing suicidal
   thoughts, and did not engage individuals in crisis. Sites were
   criticised for being impersonal, dispassionate, too focused on
   information-giving, and lacking solutions that were novel or sensitive
   to reasons why an individual may choose to seek help online. Most
   participants criticised the tendency for sites to signpost to offline
   services as their primary response. Participants desired immediacy and
   responsive online help incorporating `live chat', self-help tools,
   opportunities to interact with others and lived-experience content.
   Positive accounts of seeking online help described sites incorporating
   these features. Conclusions Formal online help services should be
   reappraised to ensure they meet users' needs for immediacy and
   responsive help to capitalise upon the opportunity available for suicide
   prevention.},

Abstract = {Opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma (OV-CCA) is a major public
   health problem in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Countries, the poorest
   region in Asia. People in this region have similar traditions or respect
   the same religion. There is no difference in lifestyle and food culture.
   Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS
   Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for
   OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk
   factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living
   along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional
   analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with
   informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics
   were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with
   95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It
   was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas,
   except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was
   found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater
   fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of
   nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani,
   Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and
   Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar
   (a reference area). This study provided the behavior-related risk
   factors for OV-CCA among people in five GMS Countries which would be a
   major jigsaw puzzle leading to proactive surveillance for OV-CCA
   prevention in the future.},

Abstract = {Background Data for front-line health-care workers and risk of COVID-19
   are limited. We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line
   health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect
   of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk.
   Methods We did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and
   the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care
   workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study
   smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to
   April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at
   first use provided information on demographic factors (including age,
   sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and
   medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms. We
   used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate
   multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which
   was a positive COVID-19 test. The COVID Symptom Study app is registered
   with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509.
   Findings Among 2 035 395 community individuals and 99 795 front-line
   health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive
   COVID-19 test over 34 435 272 person-days. Compared with the general
   community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for
   reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11.61, 95\% CI
   10.93-12.33). To account for differences in testing frequency between
   front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible
   selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust
   for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3.40, 95\%
   CI 3.37-3.43). Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of
   PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important
   factors.
   Interpretation In the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test
   for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers.
   Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and
   develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from
   COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic
   backgrounds. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is
   needed. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Background: Much of the population fails to meet recommended physical
   activity (PA) levels, but there remains considerable individual
   variation. By understanding drivers of different trajectories,
   interventions can be better targeted and more effective. One such driver
   may be a person's physical activity identity (PAI)-the extent to which a
   person perceives PA as central to who they are.
   Methods: Using survey information and a unique body of essays written at
   age 11 from the National Child Development Study (N = 10 500), essays
   mentioning PA were automatically identified using the machine learning
   technique support vector classification and PA trajectories were
   estimated using latent class analysis. Analyses tested the extent to
   which childhood PAI correlated with activity levels from age 23 through
   55 and with trajectories across adulthood.
   Results: 42.2\% of males and 33.5\% of females mentioned PA in their
   essays, describing active and/or passive engagement. Active PAI in
   childhood was correlated with higher levels of activity for men but not
   women, and was correlated with consistently active PA trajectories for
   both genders. Passive PAI was not related to PA for either gender.
   Conclusions: This study offers a novel approach for analysing large
   qualitative datasets to assess identity and behaviours. Findings suggest
   that at as young as 11 years old, the way a young person conceptualizes
   activity as part of their identity has a lasting association with
   behaviour. Still, an active identity may require a supportive
   sociocultural context to manifest in subsequent behaviour.},

Abstract = {The European polecat (Mustela putorius Linnaeus, 1758) is in decline in
   Romania, often living near human settlements, from mountains to
   lowlands. They feed on a wide variety of small animals, including
   rodents, such as mice or rats. The occurrence of this parasite in
   polecats from Romania was mentioned only once in 1991, but the parasite
   species was not confirmed by molecular biology. The study aimed to
   investigate the occurrence of Trichinela spp. in European polecats from
   Romania and to identify the parasite species by molecular tools. A total
   of 75 wild European polecats were examined by trichinoscopy and
   artificial digestion. A large number of animals were examined because of
   their wide distribution in Romanian territory and their presence near
   human settlements. For species determination, the positive muscle
   samples and the larvae recovered from artificial digestion were
   collected for DNA isolation and further processed by means of Multiplex
   PCR.
   Only two polecats from southern Romania tested positive for Trichinella
   spp. infection. During trichinoscopy examination, 48 (in a polecat from
   Giurgiu County) and 78 (in a polecat from Ialomia County) cysts were
   found in the tested (56 samples/animal) tissue samples. Artificial
   digestion revealed infection with 2466 larvae/100 g of muscle in the
   polecat from Ialomia and 254/100 g in the polecat from Giurgiu. The
   Multiplex PCR indicated the occurrence of Trichinella spiralis in the
   polecat from Giurgiu and a co-infection with T. spiralis and T. britovi
   in the polecat from Ialomia.
   The current study confirms through molecular biology, the occurrence of
   T. spiralis and T. britovi, as well as the occurrence of co-infection
   with these two Trichinella species in European polecats from Romania.},

Abstract = {Play based systems, such as computer games, have proven effective as
   tools to enhance our human understanding, skills and capabilities in a
   number of real world activities. The active pursuit of gamification and
   applied games for tasks from education to design, training and
   simulation continues to grow. The field of healthcare is one key area
   offering significant potential. Raising the question of whether play
   based assistive tools, as a means to create greater understanding of
   serious medical conditions, and the health and lifestyle impacts they
   cause, can be effective. This research involved both the review of play
   based systems that are dedicated to assisting with diabetes, as well as
   the development of a new watch based mobile App designed specifically to
   assist players (both diabetic as well as broader community) in
   understanding the complex nature of managing diabetes. Diabetes is
   listed as the sixth leading cause of death worldwide and its improved
   management is listed as a priority by the world health organization. The
   results from the randomized control trial of the new watch based tool
   showed that participants who used the play based watch App, demonstrated
   a statistically significant improvement of their understanding of the
   condition and its management. This highlights the potential of play
   based digital tools to bring greater understanding of complex medical
   conditions to patients, care givers and the broader population.},

Abstract = {Background We investigated whether a public health intervention-a
   three-part documentary called Man Up which explored the relationship
   between masculinity and mental health, well-being and suicidality-could
   increase men's intentions to seek help for personal and emotional
   problems.
   Methods We recruited men aged 18 years or over who were not at risk of
   suicide to participate in a double-blind randomised controlled trial.
   Participants were randomly assigned (1: 1) via computer randomisation to
   view Man Up (the intervention) or a control documentary. We hypothesised
   that 4 weeks after viewing Man Up participants would report higher
   levels of intention to seek help than those who viewed the control
   documentary. Our primary outcome was assessed using the General Help
   Seeking Questionnaire, and was analysed for all participants. The trial
   was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
   (ACTRN12616001169437, Universal Trial Number: U1111-1186-1459) and was
   funded by the Movember Foundation.
   Results Three hundred and fifty-four men were assessed for eligibility
   for the trial and randomised to view Man Up or the control documentary.
   Of these, 337 completed all stages (nine participants were lost to
   follow-up in the intervention group and eight in the control group).
   Linear regression analysis showed a significant increase in intentions
   to seek help in the intervention group, but not in the control group
   (coef.=2.06, 95\% CI 0.48 to 3.63, P=0.01).
   Conclusions Our trial demonstrates the potential for men's health
   outcomes to be positively impacted by novel, media-based public health
   interventions that focus on traditional masculinity.},

Abstract = {Background: Internet addiction (IA) is associated with mental health
   problems but its impact on quality of life (QOL) is understudied. We
   examined the prevalence of IA and its association with QOL in clinically
   stable patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey between September 2020 and July
   2021, the Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Patient Health
   Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the World Health Organization Quality of
   Life Brief version scale (WHOQOL-BREF) were administered to 1267
   patients with MDD. Logistic regression was used to examine the
   correlates of IA, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to
   examine the association between IA and QOL.{''}
   Results: The prevalence of IA (IAT total scores >= 50) was 27.2 \% (95
   \% CI: 24.7 \%-29.6 \%) in MDD patients. Compared to patients without
   IA, those with IA had lower QOL (F( 1, 1267) = 19.1, P < 0.001).
   Logistic regression revealed that higher education (senior high school
   and above; OR = 1.85, 95 \% CI: 1.13-3.03), family history of
   psychiatric disorders (OR = 1.72, 95 \% CI: 1.08-2.73), and higher PHQ-2
   total score (OR = 1.23, 95 \% CI: 1.14-1.32) were positively associated
   with IA while older age (OR = 0.93, 95 \% CI: 0.91-0.96) was inversely
   related to IA.
   Conclusion: IA is much more common in clinically stable patients with
   MDD compared to the reported figures in the general population. It would
   be prudent to screen and monitor internet use in MDD patients and treat
   those with IA.},

Abstract = {Background Differential exposure to public activities may contribute to
   stark deprivation-related inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection and
   outcomes but has not been directly investigated. We set out to
   investigate whether participants in Virus Watch-a large community cohort
   study based in England and Wales-reported differential exposure to
   public activities and non-household contacts during the autumn-winter
   phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic
   deprivation. Methods Participants (n=20 120-25 228 across surveys)
   reported their daily activities during 3 weekly periods in late November
   2020, late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was
   quantified based on participants' residential postcode using English or
   Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson
   mixed-effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the
   relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public
   activities during each survey period. Results Relative to participants
   in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas
   exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (adjusted risk
   ratio (aRR) range across time points: 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR:
   3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR: 1.09-1.21),
   essential shops (aRR: 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR:
   1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods. Conclusion Differential
   exposure to essential public activities-such as attending workplaces and
   visiting essential shops-is likely to contribute to inequalities in
   infection risk and outcomes. Public health interventions to reduce
   exposure during essential activities and financial and practical support
   to enable low-paid workers to stay at home during periods of intense
   transmission may reduce COVID-related inequalities.},

Title = {Management of Fracture Risk in Patients with Chronic Obstructive

Abstract = {Introduction: Osteoporosis and bone fractures are common in chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contribute significantly to
   morbidity and mortality. Current national guidance on COPD management
   recommends addressing bone health in patients, however, does not detail
   how. This consensus outlines key elements of a structured approach to
   managing bone health and fracture risk in patients with COPD.
   Methods: A systematic approach incorporating multifaceted methodologies
   included detailed patient and healthcare professional (HCP) surveys
   followed by a roundtable meeting to reach a consensus on what a pathway
   would look like.
   Results: The surveys revealed that fracture risk was not always assessed
   despite being recognised as an important aspect of COPD management by
   HCPs. The majority of the patients also stated they would be receptive
   to discussing treatment options if found to be at risk of osteoporotic
   fractures. Limited time and resource allocation were identified as
   barriers to addressing bone health during consultations. The consensus
   from the roundtable meeting was that a proactive systematic approach to
   assessing bone health should be adopted. This should involve using
   fracture risk assessment tools to identify individuals at risk,
   investigating secondary causes of osteoporosis if a diagnosis is made
   and reinforcing non-pharmacological and preventative measures such as
   smoking cessation, keeping active and pharmacological management of
   osteoporosis and medicines management of corticosteroid use.
   Practically, prioritising patients with important additional risk
   factors, such as previous fragility fractures, older age and long-term
   oral corticosteroid use for an assessment, was felt required.
   Conclusion: There is a need for integrating fracture risk assessment
   into the COPD pathway. Developing a systematic and holistic approach to
   addressing bone health is key to achieving this. In tandem,
   opportunities to disseminate the information and educational resources
   are also required.},

Title = {Child and adolescent musculoskeletal pain (CAM-Pain) feasibility study:
   testing a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data from
   children and adolescents who consult about a musculoskeletal condition
   in UK general practice},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives Test a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data
   from children and adolescents who consult their general practitioner
   about a musculoskeletal condition.
   Design Prospective cohort feasibility study.
   Setting 13 general practices in West Midlands of England.
   Participants Patients aged 8-19 years who consult their general practice
   about a musculoskeletal condition. Patients were identified via a
   relevant musculoskeletal Read code entered at the point of consultation.
   Outcome measures Feasibility was assessed in terms of study processes
   (recruitment rates), data collection procedures (duration, response
   variability), resource utilisation (mail-outs) and ethical
   considerations (acceptability).
   Results From October 2016 to February 2017, an eligible musculoskeletal
   Read code was entered on 343 occasions, 202 patients were excluded
   (declined, n=153; screened not suitable, n=49) at the point of
   consultation. The remaining 141 patients were mailed an invitation to
   participate (41.1\%); 46 patients responded to the invitation (response
   rate: 32.6\%), of which 27 patients consented (consent rate: 19.1\%).
   Participants mean age was 13.7 years (SD 2.7) and current pain intensity
   was 2.8 (SD 2.7). All participants completed the 6-week follow-up
   questionnaire. All participants found the interview questions to be
   acceptable and would consider participating in a similar study in the
   future. The majority of general practitioners/nurse practitioners, and
   all of the research nurses reported to be adequately informed about the
   study and found the study processes acceptable.
   Conclusion The expected number of participants were identified and
   invited, but consent rate was low (<20\%) indicating that this method is
   not feasible (eg, for use in a large prospective study). Recruiting
   children and adolescents with musculoskeletal conditions in a primary
   care setting currently presents a challenge for researchers. Further
   work is needed to identify alternative ways to conduct studies in this
   population in order to address the current knowledge gap in this field.},

Title = {Data mining and machine learning techniques applied to public health
   problems: A bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2018},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {138},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a bibliometric analysis of the
   applications of Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in
   the context of public health from 2009 to 2018. A systematic review of
   the literature was conducted considering three major scientific
   databases: Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct. This enabled an
   analysis of the number of papers by journal, the countries where the
   applications were carried out, which databases are more commonly used,
   the most studied topics in public health, and the techniques,
   programming languages and software applications most frequently used by
   researchers. Our results showed a slight increase in the number of
   papers published in 2014 and a significative increase since 2017,
   focusing mostly on infectious, parasitic and communicable diseases,
   chronic diseases and risk factors for chronic diseases. The Journal of
   Medical Internet Research and PLoS ONE published the highest number of
   papers. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were the most common technique,
   while R and WEKA were the most common programming language and software
   application, respectively. The U.S. was the most common country where
   the studies were conducted. In addition, Twitter was the most frequently
   used source of data by researchers. Hence, this paper provides an
   overview of the literature on DM and ML in the field of public health
   and serves as a starting point for beginner and experienced researchers
   interested in this topic.},

Title = {Urban flood modelling combining cellular automata framework with
   semi-implicit finite difference numerical formulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {272-281},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urban flooding is increasingly pervasive, with dreadful impacts on
   people and development assets. Whilst the frequency of occurrence of
   this hazard, mainly from pluvial events, is of fundamental importance in
   climate change and earth sciences research, the severity of its impacts
   motivates major debates within the context of flood risk management and
   sustainable urban development. The present study focuses on the
   development of a novel flood model, as a contribution to meeting the
   challenges of flood risk assessment within data poor urban areas such as
   in Nigeria. The new model combines the full functionality of cellular
   automata (CA) framework with a semi-implicit finite difference numerical
   scheme (SIFDS), whilst the resulting algorithms were programmed within
   MATLAB (TM) programming platform. In this study, computation complexity
   and distributed topographic data requirement, both which are associated
   with flood modelling, and which tend to present a major limitation to
   flood modelling in the developing countries (DCs) are being addressed. A
   highly urbanized area within the Lagos metropolis of Nigeria was chosen
   as a case study to validate the model and to simulate the July 10th 2011
   flooding event. A 2-m horizontal resolution LiDAR DEM, published
   Manning's friction coefficients and rainfall intensity, were used as
   data inputs into the new flood model. Simulated results compared well
   with actual flooding inundations, reported by urban residents, and
   detailed in some literature and by the media. The Pearson correlation
   coefficient (r) between predicted flood depth and estimated values is
   0.968. It is expected that the challenges of urban flooding in Lagos
   particularly and in the DCs generally will be better addressed if
   robust, but low-cost flood models are developed and utilized in the
   assessment of flood damage.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {78341-78355},
Abstract = {COVID-19 is a global health crisis that has altered human life and still
   promises to create ripples of death and destruction in its wake. The sea
   of scientific literature published over a short time-span to understand
   and mitigate this global phenomenon necessitates concerted efforts to
   organize our findings and focus on the unexplored facets of the disease.
   In this work, we applied natural language processing (NLP) based
   approaches on scientific literature published on COVID-19 to infer
   significant keywords that have contributed to our social, economic,
   demographic, psychological, epidemiological, clinical, and medical
   understanding of this pandemic. We identify key terms appearing in COVID
   literature that vary in representation when compared to other
   virus-borne diseases such as MERS, Ebola, and Influenza. We also
   identify countries, topics, and research articles that demonstrate that
   the scientific community is still reacting to the short-term threats
   such as transmissibility, health risks, treatment plans, and public
   policies, underpinning the need for collective international efforts
   towards long-term immunization and drug-related challenges. Furthermore,
   our study highlights several long-term research directions that are
   urgently needed for COVID-19 such as: global collaboration to create
   international open-access data repositories, policymaking to curb future
   outbreaks, psychological repercussions of COVID-19, vaccine development
   for SARS-CoV-2 variants and their long-term efficacy studies, and mental
   health issues in both children and elderly.},

Abstract = {Purpose We aimed to estimate the structure of internalizing and
   externalizing symptoms and potential time dynamics in their association.
   This is understudied among adolescents, despite increasing internalizing
   and decreasing externalizing symptoms in recent years.
   Methods We analyzed data from US Monitoring the Future cross-sectional
   surveys (1991-2018) representative of school-attending adolescents (N =
   304,542). Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood
   estimation method and promax rotation resulted in a two-factor solution
   (factor correlation r = 0.24) that differentiated eight internalizing
   and seven conduct-related externalizing symptoms. Time-varying effect
   modification linear regression models estimated the association between
   standardized internalizing and externalizing symptoms factor scores over
   time overall and by gender.
   Results In 2012, trends in average factor scores diverged for
   internalizing and externalizing factors. The average standardized
   internalizing factor score increased from - 0.03 in 2012 to 0.06 in 2013
   and the average externalizing factor score decreased from - 0.06 in 2011
   to - 0.13 in 2012. We found that for every one-unit increase in
   standardized internalizing factor score, standardized externalizing
   factor score increased by 0.224 units in 2010 (95\% CI: 0.215, 0.233);
   the magnitude of this increase was 22.3\% lower in 2018 (i.e., 0.174
   units; 95\% CI: 0.160, 0.188). Decoupling of internalizing and
   externalizing symptoms began earlier among boys (similar to 1995) than
   among girls (similar to 2010).
   Conclusion The decoupling of internalizing and externalizing symptoms
   among adolescents suggests that changes in the prevalence of shared risk
   factors for adolescent psychiatric symptoms affect these dimensions in
   opposing directions, raising the importance of considering symptoms and
   their risk factors together in prevention and intervention efforts.},

Title = {Equine helminth prevalence and management practices on Australian
   properties as shown by coprological survey and written questionnaire},

Abstract = {Context Parasite control is an essential part of a broader equine
   health-management strategy and is often completely administered by the
   horse owner, with little or no supporting evidence on which to base
   decisions. Practical and sound advice relies on knowledge of the
   resident parasite species, the anthelmintic resistance status of
   important species, and the strategies currently being utilised by owners
   and managers of horses. Much of this farm-level information is lacking
   in the Australian literature. Aims The present study aimed to gather
   both farm- and horse-level prevalence data for four important equine
   helminth species and to gather information on the current
   worm-management practices conducted on Australian horse farms. Methods
   We conducted a coprological survey of cyathostomins,Strongylus
   vulgaris,Parascarisspp. and equine tapeworm on 102 horse properties,
   using a combination of classical and molecular parasitological methods,
   including a tapeworm polymerase chain reaction developed as part of the
   study. A questionnaire canvasing horse owners on internal
   parasite-control practices was also distributed. Key results
   Cyathostomin were present on all farms surveyed andS. vulgaris, despite
   being considered rare, was present on 7.8\% (95\% CI: 3.9-15.0) of
   farms. The prevalence ofParascarisspp. and equine tapeworm was 33.3\%
   (95\% CI: 19.6-50.6) and 3.9\% (95\% CI: 1.5-10.1) respectively.
   Questionnaire responses showed that the majority (85.0\%) of horse
   owners administer anthelmintics at regular intervals of 12 weeks or
   less, and only 2.6\% utilise faecal egg counts to inform treatment
   decisions. Conclusions Prevalence data confirmed the endemic nature of
   cyathostomin andP. equoruminfections, as well as low levels of tapeworm
   andS. vulgarisinfections on Australian horse farms. Worm-management
   practices were reminiscent of traditional interval-style treatment
   regimens that rely heavily on macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics.
   Implications These results suggest a need for more strategic approaches
   to internal-parasite control in horses to slow the development of
   anthelmintic resistance. Such programs need to consider the risk of
   re-establishment of the pathogenicS. vulgarisin significant numbers.},

Abstract = {The horrific nature of George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis Police
   Department officer on May 25, 2020 sparked an enduring stretch of
   nationwide protests against police brutality and in support of the Black
   Lives Matter movement. During periods of crisis, anchor institutions may
   exert leadership by issuing pub-lic statements to communicate shared
   institutional values, enhance morale, and signal direction in the face
   of crisis. In our analysis of public statements issued by 56 leading
   U.S. medical schools, we found that nearly all identified George Floyd
   by name, and a majority noted the role of racism or acknowledged the
   Black community specifically. Fewer referenced the act resulting in
   Floyd's death or made explicit reference to the police. Far fewer
   explicitly used terms denoting active support, like ``antiracism{''} or
   ``Black Lives Matter.{''} Only a minority of institutions made reference
   to the killing of George Floyd by the police, and most failed to address
   this country's targeted, historically engrained, and sustained
   oppression of Black people through white supremacy. Thus, there remain
   significant opportunities for U.S. medical schools to exert meaningful
   leadership in public health. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {There is particular interest in transcriptome-wide association studies
   (TWAS) gene-level tests based on multi-SNP predictive models of gene
   expression-for identifying causal genes at loci associated with complex
   traits. However, interpretation of TWAS associations may be complicated
   by divergent effects of model SNPs on phenotype and gene expression. We
   developed an iterative modeling scheme for obtaining multi-SNP models of
   gene expression and applied this framework to generate expression models
   for 43 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project.
   We characterized the performance of single- and multi-SNP models for
   identifying causal genes in GWAS data for 46 circulating metabolites. We
   show that: (A) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression
   than did the top cis-eQTL (median 2-fold improvement); (B) predicted
   expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (false discovery
   rate < 0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite
   pairs, but, after stepwise conditional analyses, 90\% were dominated by
   a single eQTL SNP; (C) among the 35\% of associations where a SNP in the
   expression model was a significant cis-eQTL and metabolomic-QTL
   (met-QTL), 92\% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but
   interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in
   multi-SNP models; and (D) using a ``truth'' set of causal genes at 61
   met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67\%), but the positive predictive
   value was low, as only 8\% of TWAS associations (19\% when restricted to
   colocalized associations at met-QTLs) involved true causal genes. These
   results guide the interpretation of TWAS and highlight the need for
   corroborative data to provide confident assignment of causality.},

Abstract = {Individuals with cancer may be at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) and adverse outcomes. However, evidence from large
   population-based studies examining whether cancer and cancer-related
   therapy exacerbates the risk of COVID-19 infection is still limited.
   Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application
   since March 29 through May 8, 2020. Among 23,266 participants with
   cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a
   positive COVID-19 test. Compared with participants without cancer, those
   living with cancer had a 60\% increased risk of a positive COVID-19
   test. Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy or
   immunotherapy was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of a
   positive test. The association between cancer and COVID-19 infection was
   stronger among participants >65 years and males. Future studies are
   needed to identify subgroups by tumor types and treatment regimens who
   are particularly at risk for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes.},

Title = {Tracking Changes in Mobility Before and After the First SARS-CoV-2
   Vaccination Using Global Positioning System Data in England and Wales

Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Background: Evidence suggests that individuals may change adherence to
   public health policies aimed at reducing the contact, transmission, and
   spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after they receive their first SARS-CoV-2
   vaccination when they are not fully vaccinated. Objective: We aimed to
   estimate changes in median daily travel distance of our cohort from
   their registered addresses before and after receiving a SARS-CoV-2
   vaccine. Methods: Participants were recruited into Virus Watch starting
   in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants, and
   vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onward. Between
   September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch
   participants to contribute toward our tracker subcohort, which uses the
   GPS via a smartphone app to collect data on movement. We used segmented
   linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before
   and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Results: We
   analyzed the daily travel distance of 249 vaccinated adults. From 157
   days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median
   daily travel distance was 9.05 (IQR 8.06-10.09) km. From the day of
   vaccination to 105 days after vaccination, the median daily travel
   distance was 10.08 (IQR 8.60-12.42) km. From 157 days prior to
   vaccination until the vaccination date, there was a daily median
   decrease in mobility of 40.09 m (95\% CI -50.08 to -31.10; P<.001).
   After vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of
   60.60 m (95\% CI 20.90-100; P<.001). Restricting the analysis to the
   third national lockdown (January 4, 2021, to April 5, 2021), we found a
   median daily movement increase of 18.30 m (95\% CI -19.20 to 55.80;
   P=.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and a median daily movement
   increase of 9.36 m (95\% CI 38.6-149.00; P=.69) in the 30 days after
   vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of
   collecting high-volume geolocation data as part of research projects and
   the utility of these data for understanding public health issues. Our
   various analyses produced results that ranged from no change in movement
   after vaccination (during the third national lock down) to an increase
   in movement after vaccination (considering all periods, up to 105 days
   after vaccination), suggesting that, among Virus Watch participants, any
   changes in movement distances after vaccination are small. Our findings
   may be attributable to public health measures in place at the time such
   as movement restrictions and home working that applied to the Virus
   Watch cohort participants during the study period.},

Title = {Solidarity and the problem of structural injustice in healthcare},
Journal = {BIOETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {541-552},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the
   healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully
   supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare
   providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care
   ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an
   appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation
   for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing
   shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human
   solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant
   others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills
   in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and
   equality by advocating `standing with' or aiding fellow community
   members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical
   needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake,
   when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of
   justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on
   solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my
   view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly
   restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on
   solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that
   supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import
   for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks,
   personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend
   solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal
   Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to
   solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles.
   Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare
   have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its
   traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity,
   or indeed, any use of the term that posits an `other' against which
   solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that
   the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of
   some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and
   especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the
   current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in
   healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight
   a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely,
   structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against
   adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic
   action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched
   inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of
   justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a
   rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill
   suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare
   in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare
   in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it
   applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the
   obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional
   notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states
   remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity
   needs to show how it is connected to justice.
   It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly
   interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation
   between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications
   we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer
   to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the
   existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant
   analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and
   without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the
   impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an
   understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with
   the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only
   our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of
   the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address
   here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the
   needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our
   obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts,
   but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and
   articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in
   calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for
   bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched
   several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely.
   They advance the following definition: `Solidarity is an enacted
   commitment to carry ``costs{''} (financial, social, emotional, or
   otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize
   similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop
   the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within
   three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the
   administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although
   it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call
   axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this
   latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance
   morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a
   gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic
   utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity
   from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of
   the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the
   context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like
   justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of
   solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most
   highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature,
   it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on
   and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their
   approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding
   solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states.
   Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others
   within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a
   `civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection
   with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be
   entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of
   that European model in their understanding (though their conception is
   supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity).
   Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice
   helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action
   orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other
   sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing `costs'
   with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian
   tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and
   aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual
   activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term
   `costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether
   easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of
   solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the
   alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where
   solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming
   domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this
   article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity
   introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity,
   one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although
   Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and
   charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their
   argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked
   by assistance for others who are perceived as `different' from oneself,
   rather than as being `similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is
   that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect,
   inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where
   people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition
   to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in
   solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would
   be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of
   what is perceived as `similar' and what counts as `a relevant respect,'
   remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of
   similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the
   perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be
   explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that
   is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid
   circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow
   citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others
   already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of
   our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such
   as these and also explicate what counts as `similar in a relevant
   respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own
   view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the
   distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection
   that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination
   and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense
   to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx
   sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the
   latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental
   reciprocity or `tit for tat' reciprocity.
   In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact
   takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that
   reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity.
   This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from
   charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from
   the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity
   actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of
   traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The
   mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but
   one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and
   Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are
   here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least
   partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of
   benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not
   explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and
   exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers
   for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched
   inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the
   problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well
   as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine.
   But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more
   as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional
   features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle.
   Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in
   regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for
   solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from
   contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use.
   This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural
   background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged.
   Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that
   may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a
   political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that
   solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of
   domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in
   doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an
   instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is
   properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather
   than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic
   account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement
   solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social
   movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at
   agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the
   form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with
   the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have
   implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and
   for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical
   notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading
   that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or
   community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to
   compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently
   does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside
   these groups' borders.
   Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are
   transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be
   found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational
   relationships take a networked form and involve relations to
   `outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both
   generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have
   recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human
   solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the
   notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as
   underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is
   explicitly understood as `weak solidarity,' namely, `the willingness to
   take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the
   requirement `to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic
   of `strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or
   in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson
   explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and `caring
   for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing
   inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the
   Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a
   notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is
   sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the
   appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we
   find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
   where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply
   certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A
   related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the
   Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes
   a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international
   cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health
   research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go
   further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize
   these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of
   solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely
   the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx
   emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of
   solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for
   healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense
   is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among
   citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among
   members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call
   networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not
   necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to
   work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The
   first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated
   with the motto of the three musketeers: `One for all and all for one,'
   but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it.
   Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as
   involving a clear awareness of a `we' or `us'. Although some sense of a
   `we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it
   applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see.
   In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by
   Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective
   activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with
   an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as
   `similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the
   first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in
   an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants
   necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally
   committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability
   as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a
   pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but
   may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing `we' in the context of
   collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not
   aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but
   arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of
   overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least
   partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are
   not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or
   institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception
   of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as
   will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social
   ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having
   normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an
   instance of what I have elsewhere called `common activities,' the norms
   go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group
   whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of
   the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the
   group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere
   that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in
   processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should
   also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This
   follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed `equal
   positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of
   self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these
   necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency,
   no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common
   activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them.
   In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set
   of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of
   these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the
   norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and
   majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining
   group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence
   and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group
   solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative
   activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We
   can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad
   range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's
   interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents
   requires a set of conditions, both material and social.
   Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized
   negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of
   conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as
   individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive
   freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as
   well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals'
   fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared
   needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not
   only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the
   Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity
   itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities
   that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely,
   but also can be said to constitute `the other side of justice' (in
   Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's
   pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function
   in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and
   their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals.
   The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political
   communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such
   communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the
   requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further,
   the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the
   shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of
   domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided
   forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as
   they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here
   are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large
   groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination
   on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics.
   Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the
   relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such
   demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not
   external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by
   Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely
   pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and
   community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it.
   These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more
   evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called
   networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social
   movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of
   labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these
   movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly
   evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking
   solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive
   relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also
   apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is
   generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but
   may also include networking to help alleviate suffering.
   As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have
   elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the
   understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such
   solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily
   involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in
   support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a
   common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to
   justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to
   involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged,
   we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an
   expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More
   direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as
   well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among
   people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of
   networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity
   requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves
   understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody
   democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their
   equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching
   goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that
   motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as
   they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to
   realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise
   or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate
   and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to
   have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity
   actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or
   set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or
   suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking
   and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they
   offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups
   or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be
   regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from
   an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the
   first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by
   the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former
   involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals)
   undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then,
   we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as
   manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The `we' in the
   case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by
   its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular
   cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination,
   oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly
   defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the `we' should
   remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor
   solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved
   shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as
   exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as
   group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to
   outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states.
   Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of
   solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive
   rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders
   are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be
   regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so
   than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in
   principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work
   toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be
   admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are
   unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global
   justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or
   systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many
   solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion
   of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking
   solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing
   justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of
   injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups,
   if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human
   rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice.
   That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce
   injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight
   the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the
   specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such
   exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight
   on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure
   and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the
   underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the
   requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor.
   Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of
   objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of
   intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by
   others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces
   elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether
   individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but
   the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect
   existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for
   action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes
   of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with
   prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the
   capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often
   only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always
   be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.)
   More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to
   injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris
   Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices
   through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens
   focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted
   consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and
   reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by
   impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the
   existing housing stock.
   According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people
   as a result of structural processes in which many people participate.
   These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to
   the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible
   to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions
   and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure,
   Young argues, turns our attention to `how the institutions of a society
   work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of
   domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social
   positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later
   work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that
   connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social
   and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which
   people stand give rise to what she calls a `forward looking' sense of
   political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with
   others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can
   observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social
   life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary
   political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the
   power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also
   criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether
   workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and
   practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather,
   some have substantial control over the processes to which others are
   subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take
   structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the
   formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism
   and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social
   life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of
   inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they
   produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a
   thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions
   have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those
   characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what
   Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of
   solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as
   described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts
   as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give
   way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance
   for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with
   the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may
   generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these
   injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways
   that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential
   if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where
   solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly
   attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of
   the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if
   the solidarity actions are to be effective.
   For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to
   mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions
   that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately
   affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the
   ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural
   events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and
   even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are
   insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the
   impacts of the structural features of political economy and the
   injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This
   is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly
   at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor.
   In such cases, effective action must not only support workers
   individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially
   critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the
   exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of
   how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in
   healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an
   expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and
   in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from
   its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here
   is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims
   only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that
   simply `incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the
   Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice,
   these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that
   social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to
   deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to
   pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development
   and for participating in processes of collective self-determination.
   This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking
   solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary
   contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g.,
   among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented
   over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that
   solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep
   social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global,
   justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity
   remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and
   specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of
   universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their
   particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader
   goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to
   empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of
   solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social
   context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural
   injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional
   context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity
   movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated
   within these movements themselves.
   I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective
   about these effects of the structural context in which they function,
   and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in
   its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be
   mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the
   impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although
   solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need
   to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity
   action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other
   solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional
   changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and
   various political and economic transformations are also needed. But
   solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or
   interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of
   constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some
   cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of
   solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on
   solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and
   Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further
   benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to
   justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or
   systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare
   and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on
   only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of
   healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of
   practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take
   seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the
   individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners
   or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the
   solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that
   understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not
   only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx
   consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely
   different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those
   authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to
   assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks
   to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving
   healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to
   protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of
   healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of
   structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies
   evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system).
   Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow
   citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes
   to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary
   considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded
   support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along
   with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the
   universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of
   people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an
   understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice.
   There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural
   provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order
   to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth
   mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do
   nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is
   particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that
   private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally
   at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European
   countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones
   in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States
   is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice,
   rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among
   compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance
   industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is
   immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As
   part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms
   also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug
   companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the
   `power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society,
   which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law.
   Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the
   wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can
   also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human
   needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the
   systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on
   their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic
   functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the
   redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities.
   Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce
   to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many
   adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic
   injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic
   identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the
   political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful
   change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to
   equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can
   probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background
   structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of
   genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic
   economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social
   movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United
   States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in
   solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health
   insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage
   altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in
   the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to
   develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required.
   Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and
   Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading
   the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts
   to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
   They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was
   under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in
   various locales across the United States, including rural areas and
   those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health
   insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing
   non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more
   global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been
   important for understanding and addressing the social and economic
   factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters,
   e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas
   solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and
   motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that
   exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations
   expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking
   justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural
   injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in
   insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the
   health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes.
   Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself
   has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only
   increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural
   injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to
   causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have
   responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well
   known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African
   Americans made up 80\% of the people in flooded low-lying communities,
   sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the
   means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car
   ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part
   of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced
   abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the
   grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered
   each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups
   like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including
   founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A
   related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New
   Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and
   helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various
   communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the
   storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly
   contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which
   over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than
   1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were
   impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly
   vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International
   Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding
   decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health
   systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where
   there were radically insufficient medical supplies available.
   In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75\% of Haiti's
   healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply
   system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved
   a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations
   (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian
   authorities, and over 90\% of the aid money went to international
   actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid,
   too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and
   between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In
   contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the
   quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in
   solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in
   Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of
   structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by
   Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017.
   This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and
   social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years
   of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along
   with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with
   inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the
   storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the
   recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were
   exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which
   was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under
   the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti,
   we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the
   capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare
   workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto
   Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts,
   but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S.
   government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires
   understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's
   life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by
   their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of
   capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete
   natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single
   solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects,
   establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper
   structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or
   vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going
   forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the
   present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the
   situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question
   but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going
   forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements
   and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would
   be necessary for the social transformative changes required.
   Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy
   structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central
   national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean
   water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water
   supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of
   Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in
   support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017.
   Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and
   cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of
   other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable
   epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of
   health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave
   labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up
   with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the
   profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social
   and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty.
   Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself,
   we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity
   movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and
   including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are
   the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org,
   among many others. In the international context, mention should also be
   made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising
   from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war
   and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts
   have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the `White Helmets'
   operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the
   rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is
   composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise
   eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's
   Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units
   operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case,
   since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full
   discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the
   present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases
   analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens
   of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation
   of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While
   less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity
   needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural
   injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues
   for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of
   governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine
   and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis,
   Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial
   uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of
   these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish
   to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ
   the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the
   use of these databases.
   For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at
   the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented
   purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also
   tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a
   given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of
   solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the
   present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private
   profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the
   scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and
   legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to
   implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is
   constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative
   structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to
   assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed,
   one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek,
   as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can
   actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident
   especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data.
   Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural
   feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the
   solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of
   these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they
   would decide against contributing their own information, despite
   assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward
   an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the
   very existence and continuation of these structural background
   conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice,
   if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of
   solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I
   have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and
   their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about
   dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute
   their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is
   supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these
   databases and they argue that only `broad consent' is needed for the use
   of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of
   informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly
   in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given
   to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential
   discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating
   or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of
   their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer
   efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead
   placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries
   arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of
   information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and
   practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be
   aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and
   limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal
   health data for use in medical databases.
   This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise
   people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these
   untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also
   essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame
   these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and
   their openness to corporate use of the included health information in
   the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in
   safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be
   meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow
   contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of
   possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research
   the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social,
   technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks
   requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides
   the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and
   Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included
   among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large
   databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up
   of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have
   conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks.
   This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed
   to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background
   functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and
   other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are
   also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are
   overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the
   specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance
   boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly
   solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be
   drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly
   also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other
   experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for
   the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them
   would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the
   feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an
   adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those
   one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs
   and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from
   them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps
   quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use
   the qualification `quasi' here to indicate that the input in question
   may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for
   formal rights of participation on governance boards by some
   representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of
   deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on
   the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the
   Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of `personalized
   medicine' or `precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of
   analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to
   individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of
   genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson.
   The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be
   important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the
   parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in
   personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the
   intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated
   individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the
   characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to
   include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal
   preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics
   and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly
   important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what
   constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account
   suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and
   potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for
   standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender,
   race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting
   groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians
   identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural
   preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account
   and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx
   propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of
   participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested
   follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and
   hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted.
   Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at
   evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large
   databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from
   patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the
   basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly
   shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input.
   This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine
   and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role
   of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that
   solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and
   goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their
   own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies,
   a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise
   therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of
   health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also
   require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's
   social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that
   social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and
   inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic
   institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice. The author

   Ibid., p. 115. Ibid., p. 119. INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF
   SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO
   JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR
   HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has
   recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the
   motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical
   needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a
   recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear
   costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for
   governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation.
   More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for
   `standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also
   distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in
   order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the
   understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is
   unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of
   structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding
   solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social
   movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group
   with `networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of
   structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including
   countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic
   exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare,
   discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the
   solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural
   disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by
   structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they
   engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health
   databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of
   solidarity in view.},
