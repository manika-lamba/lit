However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research. Objective: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield. Methods: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users. Results: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing. Conclusions: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.",,,,,"Hassan, Lamiece/AAJ-2718-2020","Hassan, Lamiece/0000-0002-5888-422X; Nenadic, Goran/0000-0003-0795-5363",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,FEB 16,2021,23,2,,,,,,,e16348,10.2196/16348,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16348,,,,,,,,33591280,,,,,WOS:000618528500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Numerous social researchers leverage machine learning technology to build social media analytic models which can detect the abnormal behaviors or mental illnesses from the social media data effectively. Although the researchers only public the prediction interfaces of the machine learning models, in general, these interfaces may leak information about the individual data records on which the models were trained. Knowing a certain user's social media record was used to train a model can breach user privacy. In this paper, we present SocInf and focus on the fundamental problem known as membership inference. The key idea of SocInf is to construct a mimic model which has a similar prediction behavior with the public model, and then we can disclose the prediction differences between the training and testing data set by abusing the mimic model. With elaborated analytics on the predictions of the mimic model, SocInf can thus infer whether a given record is in the victim model's training set or not. We empirically evaluate the attack performance of SocInf on machine learning models trained by Xgboost, logistics, and online cloud platform. Using the realistic data, the experiment results show that SocInf can achieve an inference accuracy and precision of 73% and 84%, respectively, in average, and of 83% and 91% at best.",,,,,"Wang, Chen/E-3121-2010","Wang, Chen/0000-0003-1963-4954; Peng, Kai/0000-0001-9910-4237",,,,,,,,,,,,,2329-924X,,,,,OCT,2019,6,5,,,,,907,921,,10.1109/TCSS.2019.2916086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2019.2916086,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000492422700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the field of digital epidemiology lacks standardization which prevents it from moving away from a reproducibility crisis. In this article, we introduce the concept of a virtual digital cohort study (VDCS), a standardized method that can mimic an actual cohort study design exclusively thanks to social media data. We draw parallels between principles in epidemiology and their adaptations for a VDCS, and we use two diabetes-related examples to illustrate how a VDCS can help address some research questions. We also argue that developing a VDCS is a valid alternative to a costly, real-life, cohort implementation for some but not all research questions. We provide guidelines and recommendations to future researchers willing to launch a VDCS and, finally, we demonstrate why combining both a virtual and a real-life cohort study, sequentially or in parallel, can help conduct more relevant, patient-centric, research.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Previous studies have shown that social media data can be extracted to monitor and predict infectious disease outbreaks. These same approaches can be applied to other fields including physical activity research and forensic science. Social media data have the potential to provide real-time monitoring and prediction of physical activity level in a given region. This tool can be valuable to public health organizations as it can overcome the time lag in the reporting of physical activity epidemiology data faced by traditional research methods (e.g. surveys, observational studies). As a result, this tool could help public health organizations better mobilize and target physical activity interventions. The first part of this paper aims to describe current approaches (e.g. topic modeling, sentiment analysis and social network analysis) that could be used to analyze social media data to provide real-time monitoring of physical activity level.

Results: Some demographic factors, such as gender, the locality of accommodation, and relationship status affected the overall scores. The results also indicated Facebook, Zalo, and Youtube to be the most popular social media platforms among Vietnamese youths. Individuals who used social media for gaming also had higher BSMAS scores. FOMO and stress associated with neglect by online peers had a high correlation with social media addiction.

The aim is to reveal medical students' perceptions of sharing health data and its effect on the patient-physician relationship. Methodology: An online survey of 15 questions evaluating demographic data, attitude toward using social media, perceptions on sharing personal private health data, and influence of social media on the patient-physician relationship was designed. Results: Females (67.05%) were significantly more comfortable with sharing medical information/images on social media than males. While 43.80% of participants considered real-life patient-physician friendship acceptable, 37.59% thought it was acceptable to be virtual friends with their physicians, and only 27.14% would accept friend requests from their patients.

Methods: We conducted a survey of caregivers of children with liver disease participating in online pediatric liver disease communities within social media, as well as a survey of healthcare providers (e.g., physicians, surgeons, nurse coordinators) from this field to better understand the perceived benefits and harms of participation. Results: Among 138 caregivers of children with liver disease that completed the survey, 97.8% agreed social media was a good place to learn about patient experiences and 88% agreed it was a good source of general information. Among caregivers, 84.8% agreed social media helps them to better advocate for their child. While 18% agreed that the information over social media was equal to the information from their healthcare team and 19% neither agreed/disagreed, only 3% indicated they would use this information to change care without telling their provider; in contrast, among 217 healthcare providers, 55% believed social media may lead caregivers to change management without telling their team. Conclusion: Engagement with online disease-specific communities in social media yields several benefits for caregivers and, in contrast to healthcare providers' concerns, participation is unlikely to lead to problems including caregivers changing the treatment plan without first discussing these plans with their team. Openness between caregivers and medical teams about the role for social media can help to improve trust and maximize the potential benefits of engagement with these groups.",,,,,,"Mogul, Douglas/0000-0002-6486-3302",,,,,,,,,,,,,2234-8646,2234-8840,,,,NOV,2020,23,6,,,,,548,557,,10.5223/pghn.2020.23.6.548,http://dx.doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2020.23.6.548,,,,,,,,33215026,,,,,WOS:000591533300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social network analysis allowed us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other, a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission.

Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to monitor people's health over time. The use of tweets has several benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost. Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems: health transition detection and health transition prediction. We first propose the Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model (TM-ATAM), a new latent model dedicated to solving the first problem by capturing transitions that involve health-related topics. TM-ATAM is a non-obvious extension to ATAM that was designed to extract health-related topics. It learns health-related topic transitions by minimizing the prediction error on topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and geographic granularities. To solve the second problem, we develop T-ATAM, a Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model where time is treated as a random variable natively inside ATAM. Our experiments on an 8-month corpus of tweets show that TM-ATAM outperforms TM-LDA in estimating health-related transitions from tweets for different geographic populations. We examine the ability of TM-ATAM to detect transitions due to climate conditions in different geographic regions. We then show how T-ATAM can be used to predict the most important transition and additionally compare T-ATAM with CDC (Center for Disease Control) data and Google Flu Trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1041-4347,1558-2191,,,,AUG 1,2018,30,8,,,,,1467,1480,,10.1109/TKDE.2018.2795606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2018.2795606,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000438067400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these legal agreements are long and written in a complex language. It remains questionable whether users understand the terms and conditions and are aware of the consequences of joining such a network. With children from a young age interacting with social media, companies are acquiring large amounts of data, resulting in longitudinal data sets that most researchers can only dream of. The use of social media by children is highly relevant to their mental and physical health for 2 reasons: their health can be adversely affected by social media and their data can be used to conduct health research. Objective: The aim of this paper is to offer an ethical analysis of how the most common social media apps and services inform users and obtain their consent regarding privacy and other issues and to discuss how lessons from research ethics can lead to trusted partnerships between users and social media companies. Our paper focuses on children, who represent a sensitive group among users of social media platforms. Methods: A thematic analysis of the terms and conditions of the 20 most popular social media platforms and the 2 predominant mobile phone ecosystems (Android and iOS) was conducted. The results of this analysis served as the basis for scoring these platforms. Results: The analysis showed that most platforms comply with the age requirements issued by legislators. However, the consent process during sign-up was not taken seriously. Terms and conditions are often too long and difficult to understand, especially for younger users. The same applies to age verification, which is not realized proactively but instead relies on other users who report underaged users. Conclusions: This study reveals that social media networks are still lacking in many respects regarding the adequate protection of children. Consent procedures are flawed because they are too complex, and in some cases, children can create social media accounts without sufficient age verification or parental oversight. Adopting measures based on key ethical principles will safeguard the health and well-being of children. This could mean standardizing the registration process in accordance with modern research ethics procedures: give users the key facts that they need in a format that can be read easily and quickly, rather than forcing them to wade through chapters of legal language that they cannot understand. Improving these processes would help safeguard the mental health of children and other social media users.",,,,,"Elger, Bernice Simone/V-7265-2017","Elger, Bernice Simone/0000-0002-4249-7399; Schneble, Christophe Olivier/0000-0003-1967-7129",,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-6722,,,,,APR-JUN,2021,4,2,,,,,,,e22281,10.2196/22281,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22281,,,,,,,,33885366,,,,,WOS:000780483300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, vaccine hesitancy was listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 as one of the top ten threats to world health. Aim To employ machine-learning strategies to assess how on-line content regarding vaccination affects vaccine hesitancy. Methods We collected social media posts and responses from vaccination discussion groups and forums on leading social platforms, including Facebook and Tapuz (A user content website that contains blogs and forums). We investigated 65,603 records of children aged 0-6 years who are insured in Maccabi's Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We applied three machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Random forest and Neural networks) to predict vaccination among Israeli children, based on demographic and social media traffic. Results Higher hesitancy was associated with more social media traffic, for most of the vaccinations. The addition of the social media traffic features improved the performances of most of the models. However, for Rota virus, Hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the performances of all algorithms (with and without the social media features) were close to random (accuracy up to 0.63 and F1 up to 0.65).

Little attention has been paid to the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which include metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals. Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs.

Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak in an educational setting. Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection. Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M. tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated with case status and risk communities. Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7% positivity rate) and nine active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was 39.1% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious case (odds ratio 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The community structure analysis divided the students into five communities based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social network analysis identified that the community including the suspected index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds ratio 7.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single SNP difference. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission network and identification of communities of risk.

Study Design and Setting: Social network analysis (SNA) to describe the conversation network in a guideline development meeting in United States. Results: We analyzed one two-day guideline panel meeting that included 20 members who developed a guideline using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The conversation pattern of the guideline panel indicated a well-connected network (density = 0.59, clustering coefficient = 0.82). GRADE topics on quality of evidence and benefits versus harms accounted for 46%; non-GRADE factors accounted for 30% of discussion. The chair, co-chair and methodologist initiated 53% and received 60% of all communications in the meeting; 42% of their communications occurred among themselves. SNA metrics (eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) indicated that these individuals also exerted highest influence on discussion, controlled information flow and were at the center of all communications. Members were more likely to continue previous discussion with the same individuals after both morning breaks (r = 0.54, P < 0.005; r = 0.17, P = 0.04), and after the last break on day 2 ( r = 0.44, P = 0.015).

In neuro-oncology, traditional-methods of enrolling the large numbers of participants required or studies of disease etiology and treatment response are costly, labor intensive, and may not include patients in regions without tumor registries. Methods. In the Yale Acoustic Neuroma (AN) Study and International Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) Registry, we partenered with several brain tumor patient organizations to develop social media enrollment campaigns arid use web-based data collection resources at the Yale University School of Public Health to test alternative methods to enroll neuro-oncology patients for epidemiologic study.

Negative consequences of SMU for adolescent health could include exposures to online forms of aggression. We explored age, gender, and cross-national differences in adolescents' engagement in SMU, then relationships between SMU and victimization and the perpetration of cyber-bullying. Methods: We used data on young people aged 11-15 years (weighted n = 180,919 in 42 countries) who participated in the 2017-2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study to describe engagement in the three types of SMU (intense, problematic, and talking with strangers online) by age and gender and then in the perpetration and victimization of cyber-bullying. Relationships between SMU and cyber-bullying outcomes were estimated using Poisson regression (weighted n = 166,647 from 42 countries). Results: Variations in SMU and cyber-bullying follow developmental and gender-based patterns across countries. In pooled analyses, engagement in SMU related to cyber-bullying victimization (adjusted relative risks = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.19] to 1.48 [95% CI: 1.42-1.55]) and perpetration (adjusted relative risk = 1.31 [95% CI: 1.26-1.36] to 1.84 [95% CI: 1.74-1.95]). These associations were stronger for cyber-perpetration versus cyber-victimization and for girls versus boys. Problematic SMU was most strongly and consistently associated with cyber-bullying, both for victimization and perpetration. Stratified analyses showed that SMU related to cyber-victimization in 19%-45% of countries and to cyber-perpetration in 38%-86% of countries. Conclusions: Accessibility to social media and its pervasive use has led to new opportunities for online aggression. The time adolescents spend on social media, engage in problematic use, and talk to strangers online each relate to cyber-bullying and merit public health intervention.

We develop a framework that discovers potential causes of phasic shifts in the price movement captured by social media discussions. This draws on principles developed in healthcare epidemiology where, similarly, only observational data are available. Such causes may have a major, one-off effect, or recurring effects on the trend in the price series. We find a one-off effect of regulatory bans on bitcoin, the repeated effects of rival innovations on ether and the influence of technical traders, captured through discussion of market price, on both cryptocurrencies. The results for Bitcoin differ from Ethereum, which is consistent with the observed differences in the timing of the highest price and the price phases. This framework could be applied to a wide range of cryptocurrency price series where there exists a relevant social media text source.

Alcohol consumption in Uganda is related to several health consequences among young people, including university students. Social media is commonly used by students to share academic information and create social networks. Among young people in high-income countries, previous studies have also shown that social media use can have negative health outcomes related to alcohol use, and associated problems. To date, similar studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries are largely missing. Objective To assess the prevalence of and associations between social media use and alcohol consumption among university students in Uganda. Method This was a cross-sectional study among 996 undergraduate students at Makerere University. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Alcohol use in the previous 12 months was the dependent variable. The independent variable was social media use categorised as general use, alcohol-related use, and social media lurking/passive participation. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess associations. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were reported. Results Nearly all students (97%) used social media and 39% reported alcohol use. Regular alcohol use was significantly associated with moderate (OR = 2.22, CI: 1.35-3.66) and high level general social media use (OR = 2.45, CI: 1.43-4.20). Regular alcohol use was also associated with alcohol-related social media (OR = 6.46, CI: 4.04-10.30), and alcohol-related lurking (OR = 4.59, CI: 2.84-7.39). Similar, although weaker associations were identified for occasional alcohol use. Conclusions Approximately four in ten students reported alcohol use in the past year, and almost all students used social media. Alcohol-related social media use was associated with occasional and regular alcohol use, with stronger associations for regular use.

Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p = .0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09, p = .00258).

METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A coun-terfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant.

Although epidemiological and behavioral surveillance are integral to identifying BSMM at risk of HIV infection and transmission, overreliance on self-reported data, inability to observe social contexts, and neglect of populations with limited engagement in health care systems limits their effectiveness. Digital epidemiological approaches drawing on social media data offer an opportunity to overcome these limitations by passively observing in organic settings activities, beliefs, behaviors, and moods that indicate health risks but are otherwise challenging to capture. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether features of Facebook communication and networks were associated with biological, behavioral, and psychological indicators of HIV infection and transmission risk. Methods: Facebook and survey data were collected from BSMM aged 18 to 35 years living in Chicago (N=310). Participants' Facebook posts were characterized using 4 culturally tailored topic dictionaries related to aspects of HIV protection and risk among BSMM (sexual health; substance use; sex behavior; and ballroom culture, a salient subculture in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities of color). Social network methods were used to capture structural features of BSMM's Facebook friendships (centrality, brokerage, and local clustering) and Facebook group affiliations. Multivariable regressions revealed relationships between these Facebook features and 5 ground truth indicators of HIV infection and transmission risk (sexually transmitted infection incidence, condomless sex, sex drug use, biomedical prevention, and depression). Results: Although analysis of participants' Facebook posts revealed that HIV-related topics occupied a small portion of the total messages posted by each participant, significant associations were found between the following HIV risk indicators and Facebook features: Condomless sex, including communication about sexual health (odds ratio [OR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.29), ballroom culture (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93), and friendship centrality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92); Sex drug use, including communication about substance use (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79) and friendship centrality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) and brokerage (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99); Biomedical prevention, including communication about ballroom culture (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.71); and Depression, including communication about sexual health (beta=-0.72, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.02), ballroom culture (beta=.80, 95% CI 0.27-1.34), friendship centrality (beta=-0.90, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.21), and Facebook group affiliations (beta=.84, 95% CI 0.25-1.43). Facebook features provided no significant explanatory value for sexually transmitted infection incidence. Conclusions: Finding innovative strategies to detect BSMM at risk of contracting or transmitting HIV is critical to eliminating HIV disparities in this community. The findings suggest that social media data enable passive observance of social and communicative contexts that would otherwise go undetected using traditional HIV surveillance methods. As such, social media data are promising complements to more traditional data sources.",,,,,"Tang, Jack Lipei/AHB-3640-2022; Nan, Yuanfeixue/AAL-9373-2021","Tang, Jack Lipei/0000-0001-6207-6367; Nan, Yuanfeixue/0000-0003-1822-5948",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,OCT,2022,6,10,,,,,,,e37982,10.2196/37982,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/37982,,,,,,,,36264617,,,,,WOS:001044189700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first, critical, task for these applications is classifying whether a personal health event was mentioned, which we call the (PHM) problem. This task is challenging for many reasons, including typically short length of social media posts, inventive spelling and lexicons, and figurative language, including hyperbole using diseases like heart attack or cancer for emphasis, and not as a health self-report. This problem is even more challenging for rarely reported, or frequent but ambiguously expressed conditions, such as stroke. To address this problem, we propose a general, robust method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that combines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based features. WESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by automatically distorting the word embedding space to most effectively detect the true health mentions. Unlike previously proposed state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning techniques, WESPAD requires relatively little training data, which makes it possible to adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We evaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection benchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions of multiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD outperforms the baselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases when the number and proportion of true health mentions in the training data is small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4503-5639-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,137,146,,10.1145/3178876.3186055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186055,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000460379000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, in many cases there is a journey to overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 % of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study. First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent, sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.",,,,,"; Mantsch, John/O-9460-2014","Forati, Amir Masoud/0000-0002-6461-5448; Mantsch, John/0000-0003-0099-1599",,,,,,,,,,,,,0376-8716,1879-0046,,,,2023 APR 1,2023,245,,,,,,,,109827,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.109827,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.109827,,MAR 2023,,,,,,36868092,,,,,WOS:000950581700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, evaluating how effective these are in changing perceptions is complex. Social media may be used to assess stigma levels and highlight new trends. This study uses a social media platform, Twitter, to investigate stigmatising and trivialising attitudes across a range of mental and physical health conditions.MethodsTweets (i.e. messages) associated with five mental and five physical health conditions were collected in ten 72-h windows over a 50-day period using automated software. A random selection of tweets per condition was considered for the analyses. Tweets were categorised according to their topic and presence of stigmatising and trivialising attitudes. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on all stigmatising and trivialising tweets.ResultsA total of 1,059,258 tweets were collected, and from this sample 1300 tweets per condition were randomly selected for analysis. Overall, mental health conditions were found to be more stigmatised (12.9%) and trivialised (14.3%) compared to physical conditions (8.1 and 6.8%, respectively). Amongst mental health conditions the most stigmatised condition was schizophrenia (41%) while the most trivialised was obsessive compulsive disorder (33%).ConclusionsOur findings show that mental health stigma is common on social media. Trivialisation is also common, suggesting that while society may be more open to discussing mental health problems, care should be taken to ensure this is done appropriately. This study further demonstrates the potential for social media to be used to measure the general public's attitudes towards mental health conditions.",,,,,"Cella, Matteo/B-7131-2014","Cella, Matteo/0000-0002-5701-0336; Jilka, Sagar/0000-0003-1578-9350",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,JAN,2019,54,1,,,,,51,58,,10.1007/s00127-018-1571-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-018-1571-5,,,,,,,,30069754,,,,,WOS:000456088300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This manuscript examines how traditional and social media coverage of published findings about substance use affects downloads and scientific citations. Methods: Altmetric and bibliographic information was obtained for manuscripts published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence between 2018 and 2019 (n = 943). Associations were examined between news and social media coverage (i.e., Twitter, Facebook) in relation to number of manuscript downloads and number of citations. This was done in a bivariable manner and in a multivariable manner examining correlates of being in the top 10th percentile of downloads and citations. Results: 73.3 % of articles were shared on Twitter, 23.6 % were shared on Facebook, and 13.9 % were covered in news sources (with 4.0 % receiving major media coverage). Epidemiology papers were among the most covered in the news, and e-cigarette review papers were among the most downloaded. News and social media coverage were positively associated with number of downloads and citations in bivariable models and with achieving the top 10 % of downloads and citations in multivariable models (ps < .001). Publishing a press release was associated with higher likelihood of receiving additional news coverage (aPR = 7.85, 95 % CI: 5.15-11.97). Conclusions: Traditional and social media coverage of manuscripts focusing on substance use are associated with more downloads and citations. Researchers should consider sharing findings not only to increase downloads and citations but also to educate the general public.",,,,,,"Palamar, Joseph/0000-0002-8565-9415",,,,,,,,,,,,,0376-8716,1879-0046,,,,JAN 1,2021,218,,,,,,,,108357,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108357,,,,,,,,33317951,,,,,WOS:000600681400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to determine how the pandemic changed the research output for many neurosurgeons while highlighting how social media may have been used as a contactless platform to maintain research productivity during these times. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, 24-item, and non-randomized online survey was applied worldwide, and shared using social media platforms and emails. The questions mainly focused on comparing the results of the pre-pandemic period to the pandemic period (after March 2020). RESULTS: A total of 202 respondents from 60 different countries responded to the survey. Interest in neurosurgical education increased from 24% to 76%, while the topic of epidemiology gained interest from 28% to 72% when the pre-pandemic era was compared to the pandemic era. Preference for prospective studies decreased from 66% to 34%, while interest in retrospective studies increased from 39% to 61%. In evaluating publication types, the preference for reviews increased from 36% to 64%. Sixty-two percent of the respondents stated they had concerns over delays in individual contributions/lack of accountability. These concerns were followed by problems with theft of intellectual property/data and authorship disputes. Forty-one percent believed that the support of extra hands on a load-heavy project was the most powerful benefit of social media collaboration. Those who reported increased publications during the pandemic were also more likely to collaborate using social media (P = 0.030).

It is suggested that this effect may vary according to individual differences. Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered a protective resource that can buffer the effects of stressors in certain contexts. We examine whether this protective effect extends to the experience of social media stress. 201 young adults (mean age 26.12; 83.6% female) completed measures of EI (trait; ability), social media stress (SMS), anxiety, depression and wellbeing. SMS related to poorer mental health (symptoms and wellbeing) whilst higher EI was linked to reduced levels of SMS and better mental health.

This study investigates the feasibility of using social media, primarily Twitter, to monitor illness outbreaks such as avian flu. Using temporal, geographical, and correlation analyses, we investigated the association between avian influenza tweets and officially verified cases in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022. Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate Moran's I analysis and time series analysis, were among the methodologies used. The findings show a weak, statistically insignificant rela-tionship between the number of tweets and confirmed cases in a temporal context, implying that relying simply on social media data for surveillance may be insufficient. The spatial analysis provided insights into the overlaps between confirmed cases and tweet locations, shedding light on regionally targeted interventions during out-breaks. Although social media can be useful for understanding public sentiment and concerns during outbreaks, it must be combined with traditional surveillance methods and official data sources for a more accurate and comprehensive approach. Improved data mining techniques and real-time analysis can improve outbreak detection and response even further.

This study uses social network analysis to describe the contact network within a vertically integrated broiler poultry enterprise to identify the potential horizontal and vertical transmission pathways for Salmonella spp. Nodes (farms, sheds, production facilities) were identified and the daily movement of commodities (eggs, birds, feed, litter) and people between nodes were extracted from routinely kept farm records. Three time periods were examined in detail, 1-and 8-and 17-weeks of the production cycle and contact networks were described for all movements, and by commodity and production type. All nodes were linked by at least one movement during the study period but network density was low indicating that all potential pathways between nodes did not exist. Salmonella spp. transmission via vertical or horizontal pathways can only occur along directed pathways when those pathways are present. Only two locations (breeder or feed nodes) were identified where the transmission of a single Salmonella spp. clone could theoretically percolate through the network to the broiler or processing nodes. Only the feed transmission pathway directly connected all parts of the network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Discussion: India is one of the most diverse democratic countries that has undergone a social-cultural transition in the last decade. However, having the second-highest HIV infection rate in the world, India does not have any other new prevention tools in their national HIV prevention strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a boon of HIV prevention widely used in different countries, is still not implemented in India. The concept of Digital India by the Government of India is giving wide access of internet to the people of India. Furthermore, people are exposed to social media, and that is impacting their sex seeking behavior. Interestingly, recent legal changes in India promotes sex positivity. It also calls for introspection on existing HIV preventive strategies.

An online anonymous survey (N = 6922) was conducted in November 2020 in five Chinese provinces. Logistic regression and path analysis were adopted. The prevalence of BICV-F and BICV-SP were 78.1% and 57.7%.

Strategies for labeling posts relevant to a topic are discussed. A two-part framework is proposed in which semiautomatic labeling is applied to a small subset of posts, referred to as the seed in further text. This seed is used as bases for semi-supervised labeling of the rest of the data. The hypothesis is that the proposed method will achieve better labeling performance than existing classification models when applied to small amounts of labeled data. The seed is labeled using posts of users with a known and consistent view on the topic. A semi-supervised multiclass prediction model labels the remaining data iteratively. In each iteration, it adds context-label pairs to the training set if softmax-based label probabilities are above the threshold. The proposed method is characterized on four datasets by comparison to the three popular text modeling algorithms (n-grams + tfidf, fastText, VDCNN) for different sizes of labeled seeds (5,000 and 50,000 posts) and for several label-prediction significance thresholds. Our proposed semi-supervised method outperformed alternative algorithms by capturing additional contexts from the unlabeled data. The accuracy of the algorithm was increasing by (3-10%) when using a larger fraction of data as the seed. For the smaller seed, lower label probability threshold was clearly a better choice, while for larger seeds no predominant threshold was observed. The proposed framework, using fastText library for efficient text classification and representation learning, achieved the best results for a smaller seed, while VDCNN wrapped in the proposed framework achieved the best results for the bigger seed. The performance was negatively influenced by the number of classes. Finally, the model was applied to characterize a biased dataset of opinions related to gun control/rights advocacy. The proposed semi-automatic seed labeling is used to label 8,448 twitter posts of 171 advocates for guns control/rights.

Methods: Individual-level data came from 154,981 adolescents (mean(age) = 13.5) from 29 countries that participated in the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Intense SMU was measured by the time spent on social media, whereas problematic SMU was defined by symptoms of addiction to social media. Mental (life satisfaction and psychological complaints), school (school satisfaction and perceived school pressure), and social (family support and friend support) well-being were assessed. Country-level data came from aggregated individual-level data and data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Internet access. Results: Two-level regression analyses indicated that in countries with a lower prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported lower levels of life satisfaction and family support and more psychological complaints than nonintense users. In contrast, in countries with a higher prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported higher levels of family support and life satisfaction than 0nonintense users, and similar levels of psychological complaints. In all countries, intense users reported more friend support than nonintense users. The findings regarding problematic SMU were more consistent: In all countries, problematic users reported lower well-being on all domains than nonproblematic users. Observed differences in country-level prevalence rates of intense and problematic SMU could not be explained by mobile Internet access. Conclusions: Adolescents reporting problematic SMU are particularly at risk of lower well-being. In many countries, intense SMU may be a normative adolescent behavior that contributes positively to specific domains of their well-being.

EDs are experienced by a significant portion of our population. Social media is identified as a possible source of influence for EDs, and there is growing evidence of a large amount of ED-related discussions on the Web via social media platforms, such as Twitter. With this growing trend, automatic content analysis for EDs is becoming increasingly important. To date, there does not exist any comprehensive benchmark ED lexicon to identify ED-related conversations that would, in turn, facilitate these content analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating a lexicon base for ED language, called EDBase. The method starts with collecting over 3.7 million ED-focused tweets. In order to semantically represent potential ED terminology in a vector space, an ED word embedding model (EDModel) is trained. Then we develop a novel multi-seeded hierarchical density-based algorithm with contrasting corpora for ED lexicon expansion. The EDModel is queried by the proposed lexicon expansion algorithm to expand the seed terms to a comprehensive lexicon base. Our EDBase consists of a (further expandable) list of 3794 high-quality ED terms, quantified by an ED score, and linked to their parent terms. The proposed method significantly outperforms all existing alternative baseline methods and models by over 25% in terms of precision and 1500 in terms of true positives.

Compared to 3% of prescriptions (involving 6% of prescribers and 7% of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13% of prescriptions (involving 23% of prescribers and 24% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should be a priority.

This paper aims to identify behavioural and demographic predictors of handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020 regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or more children. However, for males without children, social media use was negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing, and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication during a pandemic - particularly through social media.

Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations.

This study investigated if social media use is associated with the initiation of cannabis vaping among US youth, using the youth dataset from Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Waves 4 (2016-2018) and 5 (2018-2019). Methods: Using youth respondents who never vaped cannabis at Wave 4 (N=8357), we conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis on initiation of cannabis vaping at Wave 5 (i.e., ever-vaped cannabis) by frequency of social media use, after controlling for covariates (e.g., sociodemographic, other tobacco and substance use). Results: In this analytic sample, 66.5% reported daily social media use, 16.2% reported non-daily and 17.3% reported 'not having a social media account' or 'no social media use' at Wave 4. Further, 14.0% (n=1183) initiated cannabis vaping at Wave 5. In the multivariable logistic regression model, daily social media use (vs. never use; aOR=2.68; 95% CI=2.05, 3.49) and non-daily social media use (vs. never use; aOR=1.54; 95% CI=1.14, 2.09) at Wave 4 were associated with cannabis vaping initiation at Wave 5. Conclusions: Our evidence suggests that social media use by youth is associated with cannabis vaping initiation among youth in subsequent years, even after controlling for other risk factors.

A representative sample of adults (N = 7331; 62.4% women; M-age = 51.94; SD = 13.48; 15-94 years) were surveyed annually across four waves. Cross-lagged panel models demonstrated bidirectional relationships between social media use and well-being. Higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction predicted higher social media use more strongly than the reverse direction, with effects particularly pronounced for the impact of psychological distress. Although the patterns of findings were relatively consistent across age and gender, results suggested that women and middle- and older-aged adults experience detrimental effects of social media use on well-being, which may drive subsequent increased use of social media. The bidirectional relationships suggest that adults who experience psychological distress or lower life satisfaction may seek to use social media as a way to alleviate poor well-being. However, paradoxically, this maladaptive coping mechanism appears to drive increased social media use which in turn can exacerbate poor well-being. Clinicians should be aware of these bidirectional relationships and work with clients towards replacing ineffective strategies with more helpful coping approaches. As this study used a simplistic measure of social media use, future research should address this limitation and explore nuanced relationships afforded by assessing specific social media activities or exposure to certain types of content.",,,,,"Sibley, Chris G/D-2974-2009; Marques, Mathew D/Y-6578-2018","Sibley, Chris G/0000-0002-4064-8800; Marques, Mathew D/0000-0002-5486-650X; Paxton, Susan/0000-0002-8486-1996; Jarman, Hannah/0000-0001-8225-4511",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,2023 AUG,2023,58,8,,,,,1247,1258,,10.1007/s00127-022-02363-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02363-2,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36121488,,,,,WOS:000858382200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

HPV can infect both females and males, and it can cause many cancers, including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers. HPV vaccination rates are lower than vaccination rates within other national vaccination programs, despite its importance. Research literature indicates that people obtain health-related information from internet sources and social media; however, the association between such health-seeking behavior on social media and HPV-related behaviors has not been consistently demonstrated in the literature. Objective: This study aims to examine the association between social media usage and HPV knowledge and HPV awareness. Methods: This study analyzed public health data collected through the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) conducted by the US National Cancer Institute. The analysis used data collected in 2020; in total, 2948 responses were included in the analysis. Six HPV-related questions were used to identify HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, and HPV knowledge about HPV-related cancers. Four questions about social media usage and one question about online health information-seeking behavior were used to analyze the associations between social media usage and HPV-related behaviors. Initially, six logistic regressions were conducted using replicate weights. Based on the results, significant factors were included in a second set of regression analyses that also included demographic variables. Results: About half of the respondents were aware of HPV (68.40%), the HPV vaccine (64.04%), and the relationship between HPV and cervical cancer (48.00%). However, fewer respondents were knowledgeable about the relationships between HPV and penile cancer (19.18%), anal cancer (18.33%), and oral cancer (19.86%). Although social media usage is associated with HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, and knowledge of cervical cancer, these associations were not significant after adjusting for demographic variables. Those less likely to report HPV awareness and knowledge included older participants, males, those with a household income of less than US $20,000, those with a formal education equal to or less than high school, or those who resided in a household where adults are not fluent in English. Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic variables, social media use was not related to HPV knowledge and awareness, and survey respondents were generally not aware that HPV can lead to specific types of cancer, other than cervical cancer. These results suggest that perhaps a lack of high-quality information on social media may impede HPV awareness and knowledge. Efforts to educate the public about HPV via social media might be improved by using techniques like storytelling or infographics, especially targeting vulnerable populations, such as older participants, males, those with low incomes, those with less formal education, or those who reside in the United States but are not fluent in English.",,,,,,"Jo, Soojung/0000-0002-2129-4373; Pituch, Keenan/0000-0003-0768-6490; Howe, Nancy/0000-0001-8933-897X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,SEP,2022,8,9,,,,,,,e37274,10.2196/37274,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/37274,,,,,,,,36125858,,,,,WOS:000957752500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: We used Monitoring the Future data from 8th and 10th grade students (n = 74,472), 2009-2017, to assess the relationship between daily social media use and depressive symptoms. Self-reported depressive symptom score (range: 4-20) was assessed continuously using a log-transformed outcome and at varying cut scores with logistic regression analyses. First, these outcomes were examined overall, comparing adolescents using social media daily to adolescents who were not. We then estimated predicted depressive symptom scores using 26 predictors in order to establish underlying depression risk. We partitioned students into depression risk quintiles to control for confounding due to underlying depression risk and examine heterogeneity in the association between social media use and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of results with different configurations of the predicted score model, and overall associations were examined in two-year groups to identify differences in effects. Results: For girls, in adjusted risk-stratified analysis, daily social media use was not associated with high (vs. low) depressive symptoms. For boys, results were inconsistent, suggesting a protective effect of daily social media use at some cut scores. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and any potential harmful effects appear to be limited to 2009-2010, limiting the evidence supporting social media as a current risk factor for depressive symptoms.

Also investigated were sex differences in multiyear growth trajectories of mental health problem internalization relative to social media use. Methods: Four waves (2013-2018) of nationally representative, longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health data were analyzed. A total of 5,114 US adolescents aged 12-14 years at baseline had repeated data across all waves. Statistical analysis involved testing a series of sequential-weighted single-group and multi-group latent growth curve models using R version 3.6.2. Results: Of the 5,114 respondents, 2,491 were girls (48.7%). The percentage of frequent social media use was 26.4% at Wave 1 and 69.1% at Wave 4 for boys compared to 38.3% and 80.6% for girls (p < .001). Boys showed an improving (-0.218, p = .005) but girls showed a deteriorating linear trend (0.229, p = .028) for mental health at the full multigroup latent growth curve model. Social media use accounted for mental health conditions across Waves 1-3 for boys (ps<.01) but only at Wave 1 for girls (p = .035). With the addition of the social media use variable alone, model fit dramatically improved , residual variances in growth patterns (i.e., random effect) became nonsignificant for boys. Substantial sex differences existed in baseline status, directionality, and shape of mental health growth trajectories as well as interplay of social media use with other factors. Discussion: Findings of the study suggest that frequent social media use is associated with poorer subsequent mental health for adolescents.(c) 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee hosted a symposium session in recognition of the ethical and social challenges brought to light by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and on the occasion of the publication of the third edition of the classic text, Ethics and Epidemiology. The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee invited the book editor and contributing authors to present at the symposium session titled 'Current Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology.' The purpose of this paper is to further highlight the ethical challenges and presentations.Methods: Three speakers with expertise in ethics, health law, health policy, global health, health information technology, and translational research in epidemiology and public health were selected to present on the social and ethical issues in the current landscape. Dr. S Coughlin presented on the 'Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology', Dr. L Beskow presented on 'Ethical Challenges in Genetic Epidemiology', and Dr. K Goodman presented on the 'Ethics of Health Informatics'.Results: New digital sources of data and technologies are driving the ethical challenges and opportunities in epidemiology and public health as it relates to the three emerging topic areas identified: (1) digital epidemiology, (2) genetic epidemiology, and (3) health informatics. New complexities such as the reliance on social media to control infectious disease outbreaks and the introduction of computing advancements are requiring re-evaluation of traditional bioethical frameworks for epidemiology research and public health practice. We identified several cross-cutting ethical and social issues related to informed consent, benefits, risks and harms, and privacy and confidentiality and summarized these alongside more nuanced ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias, group harms related to data (mis)representation, risks of misinformation, return of genomic research results, maintaining data security, and data sharing. We offered an integrated synthesis of the stages of epidemiology research planning and conduct with the ethical issues that are most relevant in these emerging topic areas.Conclusions: New realities exist for epidemiology and public health as professional groups who are faced with addressing population health, and especially given the recent pandemic and the widespread use of digital tools and technologies. Many ethical issues can be understood in the context of existing ethical frameworks; however, they have yet to be clearly identified or connected with the new technical and methodological applications of digital tools and technologies currently in use for epidemiology research and public health practice. To address current ethical challenges, we offered a synthesis of traditional ethical principles in public health science alongside more nuanced ethical considerations for emerging technologies and aligned these with lifecycle stages of epidemiology research. By critically reflecting on the impact of new digital sources of data and technologies on epidemiology research and public health practice, specifically in the control of infectious outbreaks, we offered insights on cultivating these new areas of professional growth while striving to improve population health.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is unclear whether information derived from social media is generalizable to broader populations, especially middle-aged and older adults. Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; n = 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (phi) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly very small (conventionally defined as phi or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: mean regular users = 19 vs. mean(nonregular users) = 19 (d = -0.03); physical activity: mean(regular users) = 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. mean(nonregular users) = 24 MET-hours/week (d = 0.01)). Some factors had slightly larger differences for regular users versus nonregular users (e.g., depression: 28% vs. 23% (phi = 0.05); odds ratio = 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.33); obesity: 34% vs. 26% (phi = 0.07); odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.36, 1.48)). Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a useful indicator of overall patients' health, which can be captured online. Objective: This study aimed to describe a social media listening algorithm able to detect the impact of diseases or treatments on specific dimensions of HRQoL based on posts written by patients in social media and forums. Methods: Using a web crawler, 19 forums in France were harvested, and messages related to patients' experience with disease or treatment were specifically collected. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) and EQ-5D (Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions) HRQoL surveys were mixed and adapted for a tailored social media listening system. This was carried out to better capture the variety of expression on social media, resulting in 5 dimensions of the HRQoL, which are physical, psychological, activity-based, social, and financial. Models were trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Oversampling was used to increase the infrequent dimension: after annotation, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) was used to balance the proportions of the dimensions among messages. Results: The training set was composed of 1399 messages, randomly taken from a batch of 20,000 health-related messages coming from forums. The algorithm was able to detect a general impact on HRQoL (sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.74), a physical impact (0.67 and 0.76), a psychic impact (0.82 and 0.60), an activity-related impact (0.73 and 0.78), a relational impact (0.73 and 0.70), and a financial impact (0.79 and 0.74). Conclusions: The development of an innovative method to extract health data from social media as real time assessment of patients' HRQoL is useful to a patient-centered medical care.

Although the representativeness of the web-based patient population is often noted as a concern, studies in this field are limited. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the sample bias of patient-centered social media in Dutch patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in the Netherlands among 328 patients with GIST diagnosed 2-13 years ago to investigate their digital communication use with fellow patients. A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze clinical and demographic differences between forum users and nonusers. Results: Overall, 17.9% (59/328) of survey respondents reported having contact with fellow patients via social media. Moreover, 78% (46/59) of forum users made use of GIST patient forums. We found no statistically significant differences for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time since diagnosis between forum users (n=46) and nonusers (n=273). Patient forum users did differ significantly in (self-reported) treatment phase from nonusers (P=.001). Of the 46 forum users, only 2 (4%) were cured and not being monitored; 3 (7%) were on adjuvant, curative treatment; 19 (41%) were being monitored after adjuvant treatment; and 22 (48%) were on palliative treatment. In contrast, of the 273 patients who did not use disease-specific forums to communicate with fellow patients, 56 (20.5%) were cured and not being monitored, 31 (11.3%) were on curative treatment, 139 (50.9%) were being monitored after treatment, and 42 (15.3%) were on palliative treatment. The odds of being on a patient forum were 2.8 times as high for a patient who is being monitored compared with a patient that is considered cured. The odds of being on a patient forum were 1.9 times as high for patients who were on curative (adjuvant) treatment and 10 times as high for patients who were in the palliative phase compared with patients who were considered cured. Forum users also reported a lower level of social functioning (84.8 out of 100) than nonusers (93.8 out of 100; P=.008). Conclusions: Forum users showed no particular bias on the most important demographic variables of age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time since diagnosis. This may reflect the narrowing digital divide. Overrepresentation and underrepresentation of patients with GIST in different treatment phases on social media should be taken into account when sourcing patient forums for patient-generated health data.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred online, through social media. This study aimed to provide patient perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based patient-generated health data (PGHD). Methods. A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by people with RMDs was extracted between 1 March and 12 July 2020 and examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint) conditions (ankylosing spondylitis, RA, PsA, lupus/SLE and gout). Results. The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (i) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (ii) critical changes in health behaviour; (iii) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (iv) difficulties with access to medical care; (v) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (vi) issues around work participation; (vii) negative effects of the media; and (viii) awareness-raising. Conclusion. The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs. The platform provided 'early signals' of potentially critical health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs, facilitate communication and inform clinical practice decisions.",,,,,"Nikiphorou, Elena/AAI-1523-2019; Reuter, Katja/AFM-3640-2022","Nikiphorou, Elena/0000-0001-6847-3726; Reuter, Katja/0000-0002-1559-9058",,,,,,,,,,,,,1462-0324,1462-0332,,,,2021 OCT,2021,60,,,,SI,,SI77,SI84,,10.1093/rheumatology/keab174,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab174,,FEB 2021,,,,,,33629107,,,,,WOS:000728402300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methodological advances permit simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data; or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how each context may matter differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups, schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5%, 10.8%, and 0.4%, respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth alcohol use explained by each context.

However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. Methods: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. Results: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. Conclusions: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.",,,,,"Benis, Arriel/M-6262-2016; Ashkenazi, Shai/V-7996-2019","Benis, Arriel/0000-0002-9125-8300; Ashkenazi, Shai/0000-0001-7244-0679",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAR 16,2021,23,3,,,,,,,e25977,10.2196/25977,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25977,,,,,,,,33651709,,,,,WOS:000636180100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Monitoring of social media and user-generated data on the Web enables timely and inexpensive collection of information, overcoming time lag and cost of traditional health reporting systems. Objectives:This article identifies personally experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine reactions expressed on Twitter and validate the findings against an established vaccine reactions reporting system. Methods:We collected around 3 million tweets from 1.4 million users between February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022, using COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine reactions keyword lists. We performed topic modeling on a sample of the data and applied a modified F1 scoring technique to identify a topic that best differentiated vaccine-related personal health mentions. We then manually annotated 4,000 of the records from this topic, which were used to train a transformer-based classifier to identify likely personally experienced vaccine reactions. Applying the trained classifier to the entire data set allowed us to select records we could use to quantify potential vaccine side effects. Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) referred to in these records were compared with those reported to the state of Victoria's spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community).Results The most frequently mentioned potential vaccine reactions generally aligned with SAEFVIC data.

Exploring field survey and social media indicators of quality of urban greenspace, in relation to health",URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the growing body of research exploring health benefits of greenspace, most studies treat greenspace as homogenous. There remains a need to focus on 'quality' rather than quantity of greenspace. Quality may be a substantial determinant for use and experience within greenspaces and therefore may influence health and wellbeing benefits derived from that use. This small-area level ecological study was undertaken within the city of Sheffield, UK. Health data were drawn from the general health question within the 2011 UK Census. Greenspace quality was measured using field surveys by Sheffield City Council and a range of measures from social media (from Flickr and Twitter). The extent to which quality measures extracted from social media were comparable to those from field surveys was explored to investigate whether they could proxy quality thus negating the requirement for resource intensive field surveys. The potential greenspace quality proxies from social media, however, showed low levels of correlation with quality measures from detailed field surveys. In exploring levels of health associated with greenspace quality - after adjustment for potential confounders - we found that greenspaces with lower quality, in terms of cleanliness, were associated with higher prevalence of self-reported poor health. The prevalence ratio of poor health for the quintile with the lowest cleanliness was 1.09 (95% CI 1.00-1.18), compared against the quintile with the highest cleanliness. We found little evidence of association between social media indicators of quality and poor health. Our work indicates that cleanliness of greenspace may affect adversely the health of surrounding residents. Whilst the precise mechanism for this is not yet known it is suggested that lack of cleanliness produces feelings of discomfort and insecurity, discouraging greenspace usage and inhibiting accrual of potential health and well-being benefits associated with that usage. This has important implications for greenspace provision and management.",,,,,"Ersoy Tonyaloglu, Ebru/I-6949-2019","Ersoy Tonyaloglu, Ebru/0000-0002-2945-3885; Maheswaran, Ravi/0000-0002-3899-4421; Brindley, Paul/0000-0001-9989-9789",,,,,,,,,,,,,1618-8667,,,,,MAR,2019,39,,,,,,45,54,,10.1016/j.ufug.2019.01.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.01.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000461424100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Controlling for age and gender, greater frequency of Facebook and video chat app use predicted higher levels social support but also higher levels of cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Greater use of video chat apps also predicted less loneliness. Greater use of both Instagram and Snapchat predicted more anxiety and cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals. Greater use of Instagram also predicted higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Motives for use (e.g., connect with others, waste time/avoid responsibility, online video gaming with others) also differentially predicted social well-being and mental health.

This study examined the correlation between social media use and physical/mental health among university students, considering gender and academic year. Out of 146 responses, 119 were analyzed after excluding participants with pre-existing psychological conditions. Results showed a significant correlation between social media use and mental health for all participants (correlation coefficient = 0.30, p < 0.001), indicating a negative impact on mental health with increased use. Gender-specific analysis revealed a non-significant correlation among males (p = 0.21), while females exhibited a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.32, p = 0.01), suggesting an adverse effect on their mental health. Regarding physical health, females displayed an even higher correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.40, p < 0.001), highlighting the negative influence of social media on their physical well-being. Conversely, no significant correlation was observed among males. Analyzing by academic year, both pre-clerkship and clerkship students showed a significant correlation between social media use and mental health (correlation coefficients of 0.26, p = 0.01, and 0.42, p = 0.03, respectively).

These include including anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, chronic fatigue, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). This study aimed to determine the relationship between the number of hours spent daily on social media and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms in Saudi adults. Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among the Saudi adult population. The method of distribution was performed by providing a self-administered, semi-structured online questionnaire containing 16 items designated as demographic information (i.e., age, gender, marital state, and residency), the prevalence of IBS, and frequency of social media usage. Results: Eight hundred and ten participants completed the survey (59.8% females vs. 40.2% males). The most common age group was 20-29 years (58.1%). 43% of participants recorded screen time of 6 hours or more, and 75.8% had used social media for six years or more. The prevalence of participants who were positive for IBS symptoms was 41.2%. In a multivariate regression model, female gender, associated chronic disease, and the use of Twitter were the significant independent predictors of IBS, but screen time did not predict the symptoms. Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, there was a high prevalence of IBS among the adult population living in Saudi Arabia.

These safety messages are disseminated through social media to ensure broad uptake. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the social media dissemination of 2 DSCs released in 2013 for the sleep aid zolpidem. Methods: We used the MedWatcher Social program and the DataSift historic query tool to aggregate Twitter and Facebook posts from October 1, 2012 through August 31, 2013, a period beginning approximately 3 months before the first DSC and ending 3 months after the second. Posts were categorized as (1) junk, (2) mention, and (3) adverse event (AE) based on a score between -0.2 (completely unrelated) to 1 (perfectly related). We also looked at Google Trends data and Wikipedia edits for the same time period. Google Trends search volume is scaled on a range of 0 to 100 and includes Related queries during the relevant time periods. An interrupted time series (ITS) analysis assessed the impact of DSCs on the counts of posts with specific mention of zolpidem-containing products. Chow tests for known structural breaks were conducted on data from Twitter, Facebook, and Google Trends. Finally, Wikipedia edits were pulled from the website's editorial history, which lists all revisions to a given page and the editor's identity. Results: In total, 174,286 Twitter posts and 59,641 Facebook posts met entry criteria. Of those, 16.63% (28,989/174,286) of Twitter posts and 25.91% (15,453/59,641) of Facebook posts were labeled as junk and excluded. AEs and mentions represented 9.21% (16,051/174,286) and 74.16% (129,246/174,286) of Twitter posts and 5.11% (3,050/59,641) and 68.98% (41,138/59,641) of Facebook posts, respectively. Total daily counts of posts about zolpidem-containing products increased on Twitter and Facebook on the day of the first DSC; Google searches increased on the week of the first DSC. ITS analyses demonstrated variability but pointed to an increase in interest around the first DSC. Chow tests were significant (P<.0001) for both DSCs on Facebook and Twitter, but only the first DSC on Google Trends. Wikipedia edits occurred soon after each DSC release, citing news articles rather than the DSC itself and presenting content that needed subsequent revisions for accuracy. Conclusions: Social media offers challenges and opportunities for dissemination of the DSC messages. The FDA could consider strategies for more actively disseminating DSC safety information through social media platforms, particularly when announcements require updating. The FDA may also benefit from directly contributing content to websites like Wikipedia that are frequently accessed for drug-related information.",,,,,"Pawar, Ajinkya/AAW-4051-2020; Kesselheim, Aaron/R-6793-2017; Hwang, Thomas J/C-3532-2013","Pawar, Ajinkya/0000-0002-8585-9505; Kesselheim, Aaron/0000-0002-8867-2666; Hwang, Thomas J/0000-0003-0717-1497; Dal Pan, Gerald/0000-0003-4874-5864; Donneyong, Macarius M./0000-0003-2710-913X; Zhou, Esther H/0000-0003-4608-6850; Rausch, Paula/0000-0002-3016-241X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,JAN-MAR,2018,4,1,,,,,116,126,e1,10.2196/publichealth.7823,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7823,,,,,,,,29305342,,,,,WOS:000526815300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The social media presence of public figures owning exotic pets has a major influence on exotic species demand. This study aimed to investigate exotic pet popularity, featured species on social media in the Middle East, and public perception of the animals spotlighted by public figures. We discuss the impact of such on the exotic pet trade and possible solutions to this issue. Male public figures from the United Arab Emirates predominated in the collected data, with most posts sourced from Instagram (R). Eighty-five percent of the species displayed on social media posts were Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I- and II-listed, including big cats, birds of prey, and great apes. Through an investigation of social media posts of public figures in the Middle East, we found that there was an overall positive audience reception toward endangered exotic pets. Geographic region, social media platform, animal species, and animal age all influenced the results. We recommend improving public education and awareness of wildlife conservation and laws regarding exotic pet possession to combat the idolization of the exotic pet industry. The popularization of exotic pets on celebrity social media in the Middle East has led to questionable impacts on exotic pet demand and threats to species conservation. The objective of this study was to identify exotic animal species featured on Middle Eastern celebrity social media account posts, the public perception of those posts, and their potential impacts on exotic pet demand and conservation (for global-scale extrapolation). Public social media accounts of highly influential persons from oil-rich Middle Eastern regions were manually investigated to evaluate subject demographics, species features, and post information (likes, comments) between January 2017 and August 2018. Twenty-five subjects possessed active social media accounts, from which 418 social media posts were extracted based on their inclusion of a privately owned exotic animal. SPSS Version 25 was used for frequency and descriptive analyses of these posts, in addition to comment analyses to evaluate quantitative (emojis) and qualitative (text) audience perceptions from a total of 10 social media posts of CITES Appendix I- or II-listed species. A greater frequency of positive than negative comments was observed (n = 8017), demonstrating the higher likelihood of social media promotion rather than negation of the exotic pet trade.

We analyzed the data to describe lupus patients and the expressed themes (symptoms and medications). Two independent coders analyzed the data; Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to ensure interrater reliability. Differences in symptom and medication expressions were analyzed using 2-tailed Z tests and a combination of 1-way analysis of variance tests and unpaired t-tests. Results We found that lupus patients on Twitter are diverse in gender and race: approximately one-third (34.64%, 62 of 179) were persons of color (POCs), and 85.47% were female.

Objective: The primary objectives of this study were (i) to assess whether rare health-related events-in this case, birth defects-are reported on social media, (ii) to design and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) approach for collecting such sparse data from social media, and (iii) to utilize the collected data to discover a cohort of women whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed on social media for epidemiological analysis. Methods: To assess whether birth defects are mentioned on social media, we mined 432 million tweets posted by 112,647 users who were automatically identified via their public announcements of pregnancy on Twitter. To retrieve tweets that mention birth defects, we developed a rule-based, bootstrapping approach, which relies on a lexicon, lexical variants generated from the lexicon entries, regular expressions, post-processing, and manual analysis guided by distributional properties. To identify users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed for epidemiological analysis, inclusion criteria were (i) tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect, and (ii) accessibility to the user's tweets during pregnancy. We conducted a semi-automatic evaluation to estimate the recall of the tweet-collection approach, and performed a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of selected birth defects among the pregnancy cohort derived from Twitter. Results: We manually annotated 16,822 retrieved tweets, distinguishing tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect (true positives) from tweets that merely mention birth defects (false positives). Inter-annotator agreement was substantial: K = 0.79 (Cohen's kappa). Analyzing the timelines of the 646 users whose tweets were true positives resulted in the discovery of 195 users that met the inclusion criteria. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect reported on Twitter, consistent with findings in the general population. Based on an evaluation of 4169 tweets retrieved using alternative text mining methods, the recall of the tweet collection approach was 0.95. Conclusions: Our contributions include (i) evidence that rare health-related events are indeed reported on Twitter, (ii) a generalizable, systematic NLP approach for collecting sparse tweets, (iii) a semi-automatic method to identify undetected tweets (false negatives), and (iv) a collection of publicly available tweets by pregnant users with birth defect outcomes, which could be used for future epidemiological analysis.

Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was disseminated by West China Hospital via its official online platforms, between May 18, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The questionnaire collected the sociodemographic information of 14,509 adults, and included questions surveying Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19, personal social media use, health behavioral change tendencies, and cross-verification behaviors for web-based information during the pandemic. Multiple stepwise regression models were used to examine the relationships between social media use, behavior changes, and information cross-verification. Results: Respondents who were most likely to change their health behaviors after obtaining web-based COVID-19 information from celebrity sources had the following characteristics: female sex (P=.004), age >= 50 years (P=.009), higher COVID-19 knowledge and health literacy (P=.045 and P=.03, respectively), non-health care professional (P=.02), higher frequency of searching on social media (P<.001), better health conditions (P<.001), and a trust rating score of more than 3 for information released by celebrities on social media (P=.005). Furthermore, among participants who were most likely to change their health behaviors according to social media information released by celebrities, female sex (P<.001), living in a rural residence rather than first-tier city (P<.001), self-reported medium health status and lower health care literacy (P=.007 and P<.001, respectively), less frequent search for COVID-19 information on social media (P<.001), and greater level of trust toward celebrities' social media accounts with a trust rating score greater than 1 (P <=.04) were associated with a lack of cross-verification of information. Conclusions: The findings suggest that governments, health care agencies, celebrities, and technicians should combine their efforts to decrease the risk in vulnerable groups that are inclined to change health behaviors according to web-based information but do not perform any fact-check verification of the accuracy of the unofficial information. Specifically, it is necessary to correct the false information related to COVID-19 on social media, appropriately apply celebrities' star power, and increase Chinese netizens' awareness of information cross-verification and eHealth literacy for evaluating the veracity of web-based information.",,,,,,"Deveaux, Genevieve/0000-0002-1389-3915; Luo, Yunmei/0000-0002-2661-3214; Tao, Wenjuan/0000-0002-5926-2545",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,MAY,2022,8,5,,,,,,,e33577,10.2196/33577,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/33577,,,,,,,,35486529,,,,,WOS:000809494600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. Objective: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. Methods: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. Results: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R(0 )of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). Conclusions: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R-0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is unhealthy that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.",,,,,"YAN, LING/JXY-6904-2024; Wang, Hanyin/AAB-7835-2022; chen, qiang/JXY-6982-2024; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; Luo, Yuan/K-5563-2016","Wang, Hanyin/0000-0001-9884-9683; Li, Yikuan/0000-0001-7546-9979; Luo, Yuan/0000-0003-0195-7456; Hutch, Meghan/0000-0001-8130-9429; Naidech, Andrew/0000-0003-1065-5417",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,FEB 22,2021,23,2,,,,,,,e26302,10.2196/26302,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26302,,,,,,,,33529155,,,,,WOS:000620344800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data on the recurrence risk are largely unavailable, as only case reports or very small case series exist in which only 1 woman had recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the risk of acute fatty liver of pregnancy recurrence and to compare disease severity and gestational age between primary and recurrent disease using patient-provided data from an acute fatty liver of pregnancy social media patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and distributed an electronic questionnaire through an international Facebook group called Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy. The data collection took place from June 11, 2018, to August 17, 2018, using REDCap. Our main outcome measures were recurrence of acute fatty liver of pregnancy, severity with recurrence, and gestational age at delivery. RESULTS: A total of 69 women with previous acute fatty liver of pregnancy completed the questionnaire; 24 women had a subsequent delivery, of whom 5 women were diagnosed with acute fatty liver of pregnancy again. In 4 of 5 of these women (80%), acute fatty liver of pregnancy took a milder course, whereas in 1 woman it worsened in the next pregnancy. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy recurrence delivered at a median gestational age at 265 days (interquartile range, 242-287 days) in their first pregnancy with acute fatty liver of pregnancy as compared to delivery by a prelabor cesarean delivery at 245 days (interquartile range, 235-261 days) in their second pregnancy with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Male fetal sex was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: One in 5 women reported having had recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy, with most cases being milder, possibly because of an earlier gestational age at delivery.",,,,,"Boie, Sidsel/I-5773-2019; Glavind, Julie/AAQ-2408-2020","Boie, Sidsel/0000-0002-8725-2117; Glavind, Julie/0000-0002-9856-6621",,,,,,,,,,,,,2589-9333,,,,,MAY,2020,2,2,,,,,,,100085,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100085,,,,,,,,33345956,,,,,WOS:000658221800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed social media messages about HIV, opioid use and injection drug use in order to understand how unstructured data can prepare public health practitioners for response to future outbreaks. Design and Methods We conducted an retrospective analysis of Twitter messages during the 2015 HIV Indiana outbreak using machine learning, statistical and geospatial analysis to examine the transition between opioid prescription drug abuse to heroin injection use and finally HIV transmission risk, and to test possible associations with disease burden and demographic variables in Indiana and Marion County. Tweets from October 2014 to June 2015 were compared to disease burden at the county level for Indiana, and classification of census blocks by presence of relevant messages was done at the census block level for Marion County. Marion County was used as it exhibited the highest total count of Tweets. Results 257 messages about substance abuse and HIV were significantly related to HIV rates (P < 0.001) and opioid-related hospitalisations (P = 0.037). Using 157 characteristics from the American Community Survey, a linear classifier was computed with an appreciable correlation (r = 0.49) to risk-related social media messages from Marion County.

There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.Objective: The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.Methods: The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.Results: The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.Conclusions: The DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research.",,,,,"Lamy, Francois Rene/AFS-0816-2022","Lamy, Francois Rene/0000-0001-6542-1381; Sheth, Amit/0000-0002-0021-5293; Thirunarayan, Krishnaprasad/0000-0002-7041-6963; Lokala, Usha/0000-0001-6186-2171; Kursuncu, Ugur/0000-0002-8108-9590; Daniulaityte, Raminta/0000-0001-6507-3866; Gaur, Manas/0000-0002-5411-2230",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,DEC,2022,8,12,,,,,,,e24938,10.2196/24938,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24938,,,,,,,,36563032,,,,,WOS:000957773600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have assessed the unmet needs and burden of aBC from patient and caregiver perspectives. Infodemiology, that is, epidemiology based on internet health-related content, can help obtain more insights on patients' and caregivers' experiences with aBC. Objective: The study aimed to identify the main discussion themes and the unmet needs of patients with aBC and their caregivers through a mixed methods analysis of social media posts. Methods: Social media posts were collected between January 2015 and April 2021 from US geolocalized sites using specific keywords for aBC. Automatic natural language processing (regular expressions and machine learning) methods were used to filter out irrelevant content and identify verbatim posts from patients and caregivers. The verbatim posts were analyzed to identify main discussion themes using biterm topic modeling. Difficulties or unmet needs were further explored using qualitative research methods by 2 independent annotators until saturation of concepts. Results: A total of 688 posts from 262 patients and 1214 posts from 679 caregivers discussing aBC were identified. Analysis of 340 randomly selected patient posts and 423 randomly selected caregiver posts uncovered 33 unique unmet need categories among patients and 36 among caregivers. The main unmet patient needs were related to challenges regarding adverse events (AEs; 28/95, 29%) and the psychological impact of aBC (20/95, 21%). Other patient unmet needs identified were prognosis or diagnosis errors (9/95, 9%) and the need for better management of aBC symptoms (9/95, 9%). The main unmet caregiver needs were related to the psychological impacts of aBC (46/177, 26.0%), the need for support groups and to share experiences between peers (28/177, 15.8%), and the fear and management of patient AEs (22/177, 12.4%). Conclusions: The combination of manual and automatic methods allowed the extraction and analysis of several hundreds of social media posts from patients with aBC and their caregivers.

We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. Results: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.

Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19-related keywords and then using vaccine-and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes.",,,,,"Sheikh, Aziz/D-2818-2009; Dashtipour, Kia/AAX-9489-2020; Hussain, Amir/AAG-6299-2020","Sheikh, Aziz/0000-0001-7022-3056; Dashtipour, Kia/0000-0002-9651-6487; Hussain, Amir/0000-0002-8080-082X; Sheikh, Zakariya/0000-0003-4147-4205; Tahir, Ahsen/0000-0001-8247-9390; Hussain, Zain/0000-0002-0559-8289; Gogate, Mandar/0000-0003-1712-9014",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,MAY,2022,8,5,,,,,,,e32543,10.2196/32543,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32543,,,,,,,,35144240,,,,,WOS:000809494600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

By combining these keywords, an advanced search of various relevant databases was performed to identify all articles of interest from 2000 to 2021, with an initial retrieval date of 13 December 2021. A total of six medical and health science, psychology, social science and communication databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO and CNKI. A three-stage screening process against inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted.FindingsA total of 338 studies were identified for data extraction, with the earliest study published in 2010. Thematic analysis of the role of social media revealed three broad themes: surveillance monitoring, risk communication and disease control. Within these themes, 12 subthemes were also identified. Within surveillance monitoring, the subthemes were disease detection and prediction, public attitude and attention, public sentiment and mental health. Within risk communication, the subthemes were health advice, information-seeking behaviour, infodemics/misinformation circulation, seeking help online, online distance education and telehealth. Finally, within disease control, the subthemes were government response, public behaviour change and health education information quality. It was clear that the pace of research in this area has gradually increased over time as social media has evolved, with an explosion in attention following the outbreak of COVID-19.Conclusions and relevanceSocial media has become a hugely powerful force in public health and cannot be ignored or viewed as a minor consideration when developing public health policy. Limitations of the study are discussed, along with implications for government, health authorities and individual users.

Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. Objectives This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. Methods An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. Results In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. Conclusions The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.",,,,,"Ali, Shahmir/G-4495-2018","Ali, Shahmir/0000-0002-0360-3507",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2288,,,,MAY 13,2020,20,1,,,,,,,116,10.1186/s12874-020-01011-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01011-0,,,,,,,,32404050,,,,,WOS:000536292700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modeling its epidemiology and designing effective interventions requires real-time data analysis along with the means to contextualize addiction patterns across the individual-to-community scale. In this context, social media platforms have begun to receive significant attention as a novel source of real-time user-reported information. However, the ability of epidemiologists to use such information is significantly stymied by the lack of publicly available algorithms and software for addiction information extraction, analysis and modeling. Results: SMARTS is a public, open source, web-based application that addresses the aforementioned deficiency. SMARTS is designed to analyze data from two popular social media forums, namely, Reddit and Twitter and can be used to study the effect of various intoxicants including, opioids, weed, kratom, alcohol and cigarettes. The SMARTS software analyzes social media posts using natural language processing, and machine learning to characterize drug use at both the individual- and population-levels. Included in SMARTS is a predictive modeling functionality that can, with high accuracy, identify individuals open to addiction recovery interventions.

Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 % CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.",,,,,"Fowler, James H/C-2750-2008","Fowler, James H/0000-0001-7795-1638; Witte, Carmel/0000-0001-9086-3333",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-5877,1873-1716,,,,2021 AUG,2021,193,,,,,,,,105415,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105415,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105415,,JUL 2021,,,,,,34252815,,,,,WOS:000675466300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is therefore crucial to characterize the disease progress and epidemics process efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the progression of the disease and its underlying contact network, but as yet lacks the ability to process of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised neural network framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques for influenza epidemiological modeling. Specifically, this framework learns social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. The learned knowledge from social media can then be fed into the computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm that iteratively processes the above interactive learning process. The extensive experimental results provided demonstrated that our approach can not only outperform competing methods by a substantial margin in forecasting disease outbreaks, but also characterize the individual-level disease progress and diffusion effectively and efficiently.",,,,,,"Jin, Fang/0000-0002-6606-5232; Lu, Chang-Tien/0000-0003-3675-0199; Ramakrishnan, Naren/0000-0002-1821-9743",,,,,,,,,,,,,1384-6175,1573-7624,,,,APR,2020,24,2,,,SI,,443,475,,10.1007/s10707-019-00376-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10707-019-00376-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000530819800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The world has experienced a lot of uncertainty since then as we all get used to this new 'normal' with social distancing measures, lockdowns, the emergence of new variants, and an array of hope with the development of vaccines. Having an abstract understanding of vaccine delivery, public perceptions of vaccines, and promoting acceptance of vaccines are critical to tackling the pandemic. The advent of the pandemic has led to the emergence of an 'infodemic' or rampant misinformation surrounding the virus, treatment, and vaccines. This poses a critical threat to global health as it has the potential to lead to a public health crisis by exacerbating disease spread and overwhelming healthcare systems. This 'infodemic' has led to rising vaccine hesitancy which is of paramount concern with the WHO even identifying it as one of the ten main threats to Global health almost 2 years before the approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant African women are one of the most vulnerable population groups in a region with an already burdened healthcare system.

Yet, worst-case adversarial modeling can overestimate risk and induce heavy editing of shared data. The objective of this study is to introduce a framework for assessing the risk considering the attacker's resources and capabilities. Materials and Methods: We integrate 3 established risk measures (ie, prosecutor, journalist, and marketer risks) and compute re-identification probabilities for data subjects. This probability is dependent on an attacker's capabilities (eg, ability to obtain external identified resources) and the subject's decision on whether to reveal their participation in a dataset. We illustrate the framework through case studies using data from over 1 000 000 patients from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and show how re-identification risk changes when attackers are pragmatic and use 2 known resources for attack: (1) voter registration lists and (2) social media posts. Results: Our framework illustrates that the risk is substantially smaller in the pragmatic scenarios than in the worst case. Our experiments yield a median worst-case risk of 0.987 (where 0 is least risky and 1 is most risky); however, the median reduction in risk was 90.1% in the voter registration scenario and 100% in the social media posts scenario. Notably, these observations hold true for a wide range of adversarial capabilities. Conclusions: This research illustrates that re-identification risk is situationally dependent and that appropriate adversarial modeling may permit biomedical data sharing on a wider scale than is currently the case.",,,,,"Wan, Zhiyu/ACA-8019-2022","Wan, Zhiyu/0000-0003-3752-5778",,,,,,,,,,,,,1067-5027,1527-974X,,,,2021 APR,2021,28,4,,,,,744,752,,10.1093/jamia/ocaa327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa327,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33448306,,,,,WOS:000648977500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective The aim of this study was to identify by whom, how frequently, and in what manner allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is discussed on social media sites. Methods Search terms allergic contact dermatitis and contact dermatitis were queried across Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Google search metrics. The frequency, content, and creators of the content were assessed. Results ACD content was identified on all platforms, generated by by patients, physicians, professional organizations, and companies. When comparing the volume of posts, more content was on Instagram than Twitter, particularly among patients. Patient support groups were identified on Facebook but not on Reddit. A formal analysis of YouTube videos found that the medical information presented in these videos was often of poor quality. Conclusions Patch testing physicians should be aware that information on ACD exists across social media sites. While some content is generated by physicians, patients and industry groups also post and share material. Patch testing physicians should know that there is an opportunity to share ACD information, but they should also be aware that patients are posting and creating online support communities independent of physicians. Highlights Online support communities exist for patients with ACD on Facebook. Online information is of lower quality, with a mean QUEST quality score of 7.4/28 on reviewed YouTube videos. Of the five social media sites reviewed, patients are most active on Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook. Approximately 9000 Google searches per month are conducted using contact dermatitis-related search terms. Differences in terminology exist between physicians and non-physicians. While the most popular hashtag term was contact dermatitis, physicians disproportionately authored posts tagged with allergic contact dermatitis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0105-1873,1600-0536,,,,2022 MAR,2022,86,3,,,,,196,203,,10.1111/cod.14004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cod.14004,,DEC 2021,,,,,,34741559,,,,,WOS:000729275300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contact tracing data could also be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set with diagnosed patients as nodes and their epidemiological contact as edges was created. Directed network perspective was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a source patient towards a target patient. Network measures of degree centrality and betweenness centrality were calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65% (12) patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have collectively infected 37.61% (296 of 787), secondary patients. Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network component analysis identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95% of total patients (1959) and 68.74% of epidemiological contacts in the network. Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help improve the contact tracing activities.",,,,,"Muniyandi, Malaisamy/AAF-2076-2021","senthil, sellappan/0000-0003-1983-7882",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2288,,,,SEP 17,2020,20,1,,,,,,,233,10.1186/s12874-020-01119-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01119-3,,,,,,,,32942988,,,,,WOS:000573626100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most research in this area relies on self-reported assessments of psychological factors, which are difficult to scale because they may be expensive and time-consuming. Investigators are increasingly interested in using social media as a novel and convenient platform for obtaining information rapidly in large populations. Objective: We evaluated the feasibility of obtaining Facebook data from a large ongoing cohort study of midlife and older women, which may be used to assess psychological functioning efficiently with low cost. Methods: This study was conducted with participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), which was initiated in 1989 with biennial follow-ups. Facebook does not share data readily; therefore, we developed procedures to enable women to download and transfer their Facebook data to cohort servers (for linkage with other study data they have provided). Since privacy is a critical concern when collecting individual-level data, we partnered with a third-party software developer, Digi.me, to enable participants to obtain their own Facebook data and to send it securely to our research team. In 2020, we invited a subset of the 18,519 NHSII participants (aged 56-73 years) via email to participate. Women were selected if they reported on the 2017-2018 questionnaire that they regularly posted on Facebook and were still active cohort participants. We included an exit survey for those who chose not to participate in order to gauge the reasons for nonparticipation. Results: We invited 309 women to participate. Few women signed the consent form (n=52), and only 3 used the Digi.me app to download and transfer their Facebook data. This low participation rate was observed despite modifying our protocol between waves of recruitment, including by (1) excluding active health care workers, who might be less available to participate due to the pandemic, (2) developing a Frequently Asked Questions factsheet to provide more information regarding the protocol, and (3) simplifying the instructions for using the Digi.me app. On our exit survey, the reasons most commonly reported for not participating were concerns regarding data privacy and hesitation sharing personal Facebook posts. The low participation rate suggests that obtaining individual-level Facebook data in a cohort of middle-aged and older women may be challenging. Conclusions: In this cohort of midlife and older women who were actively participating for over three decades, we were largely unable to obtain permission to access individual-level data from participants' Facebook accounts. Despite working with a third-party developer to customize an app to implement safeguards for privacy, data privacy remained a key concern in these women. Future studies aiming to leverage individual-level social media data should explore alternate populations or means of sharing social media data.",,,,,,"Lee, Harold/0000-0001-5778-3227; Koga, Hayami Kikuchi/0000-0002-9716-2502; James, Peter/0000-0002-2858-1973",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,APR,2022,6,4,,,,,,,e32423,10.2196/32423,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32423,,,,,,,,35389368,,,,,WOS:000854074400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse. Results We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a greater correlation with addiction relapse. Conclusions The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first use of structural equation modeling of social media data with the goal of analyzing factors influencing addiction recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2105,,,,,DEC 30,2020,21,,,18,,,,,554,10.1186/s12859-020-03893-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03893-9,,,,,,,,33375934,,,,,WOS:000607075600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We found increased discomfort, that is, bundled negative emotions after the storm as compared to during the storm. Furthermore, pre- and peri-disaster discomfort was positively associated with post-disaster discomfort; however, this association was different across boroughs, with significant associations only in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. In addition, rates were most prominently spatially clustered in Staten Island lasting pre- to post-disaster.

However, the extent to which researchers and the public are made adequately aware of these retractions and how the media and social media respond to them remains unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the media and social media attention received by retracted articles and assess also the attention they receive post-retraction versus pre-retraction. We downloaded all records of retracted literature maintained by the Retraction Watch Database and originally published between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. For all 3,008 retracted articles with a separate DOI for the original and its retraction, we downloaded the respective Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) (from Altmetric) and citation count (from Crossref), for the original article and its retraction notice on June 6, 2018. We also compared the AAS of a random sample of 572 retracted full journal articles available on PubMed to that of unretracted full articles matched from the same issue and journal. 1,687 (56.1%) of retracted research articles received some amount of Altmetric attention, and 165 (5.5%) were even considered popular (AAS>20). 31 (1.0%) of 2,953 with a record on Crossref received >100 citations by June 6, 2018. Popular articles received substantially more attention than their retraction, even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction (Median difference, 29; 95% CI, 17-61). Unreliable results were the most frequent reason for retraction of popular articles (32; 19%), while fake peer review was the most common reason (421; 15%) for the retraction of other articles. In comparison to matched articles, retracted articles tended to receive more Altmetric attention (23/31 matched groups; P-value, 0.01), even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction. Our findings reveal that retracted articles may receive high attention from media and social media and that for popular articles, pre-retraction attention far outweighs post-retraction attention.",,,,,,"Serghiou, Stylianos/0000-0002-2477-6060",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 12,2021,16,5,,,,,,,e0248625,10.1371/journal.pone.0248625,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248625,,,,,,,,33979339,,,,,WOS:000664627300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective The objective of this study was to explore public opinion about using automated methods to detect and report mentions of ADRs on social media to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts. Methods Users of the online health discussion forum HealthUnlocked participated in an online survey (N = 1359) about experiences with ADRs, knowledge of pharmacovigilance methods, and opinions about using automated data mining methods to detect and report ADRs. To further explore responses, five qualitative focus groups were conducted with 20 social media users with long-term health conditions. Results Participant responses indicated a low awareness of pharmacovigilance methods and ADR reporting. They showed a strong willingness to share health-related social media data about ADRs with researchers and regulators, but were cautious about automated text mining methods of detecting and reporting ADRs.

In Finland, the Prime Minister's Office initiated a communication campaign that utilized social media influencers to communicate timely instructions regarding the pandemic. However, it is uncertain how social media influencers adapt to briefings of public organizations given that they typically work with brands that align with their own interests and expertise, which rarely is epidemiology. We use the two-step flow of communication model and social influence theory to analyze research data that consisted of 96 Instagram posts, 108 Instagram Stories and 1097 comments. Qualitative content analysis was used to see how the influencers communicated about the pandemic and how their followers reacted. The results suggest that the influencers tried to adapt the messages to their own style, and, instead of committing to the wordings of the campaign, they shared general guidelines and, with their own example, showed how to behave during the pandemic. Their participation in the campaign helped affect social norms during the time of the crisis, which in the case of public health communication is a substantial, strategic goal.",,,,,"; Luoma-aho, Vilma/H-3368-2012","Reinikainen, Hanna/0000-0002-3165-4889; Luoma-aho, Vilma/0000-0003-1316-3725; Poyry, Essi/0000-0003-2940-8889",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-118X,1553-1198,,,,MAY 27,2022,16,3,,,SI,,469,484,,10.1080/1553118X.2022.2042694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1553118X.2022.2042694,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000989999800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypothesis Social media use and social interactions influence the smoking behaviour of Bangladeshi university students, particularly in starting and maintaining cigarette smoking. Design and setting A cross-sectional study using mixed methods on 600 student smokers and non-smokers recruited from two public and two private universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country with limited resources. Exclusion criteria were those who did not use any form of social media and PhD students. Results Odds of smoking were significantly higher for those who socialised more than 4 hours/day (p<0.05; OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.75) and typically at night (p<0.05; OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.95 to 4.00). Odds of smoking were also higher for those who liked (p<0.05; OR 4.85; 95% CI 3.32 to 7.11), shared (p<0.05; OR 20.50; 95% CI 13.02 to 32.26) and followed (p<0.05; OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.36 to 6.11) tobacco-related content on social media. Qualitative analysis resulted in emergent themes of smokers imitating tobacco-related photos or videos seen on social media and peers as an influence for smoking initiation.

However, few longitudinal studies have investigated this association, and none have quantified the proportion of mental health problems among adolescents attributable to social media use. OBJECTIVE To assess whether time spent using social media per day is prospectively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of 6595 participants from waves 1 (September 12, 2013, to December 14, 2014), 2 (October 23, 2014, to October 30, 2015), and 3 (October 18, 2015, to October 23, 2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative cohort study of US adolescents, assessed US adolescents via household interviews using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Data analysis was performed from January 14, 2019, to May 22, 2019. EXPOSURES Self-reported time spent on social media during a typical day (none, <= 30 minutes, >30 minutes to <= 3 hours, >3 hours to <= 6 hours, and >6 hours) during wave 2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE Self-reported past-year internalizing problems alone, externalizing problems alone, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems during wave 3 using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener. RESULTS A total of 6595 adolescents (aged 12-15 years during wave 1; 3400 [51.3%] male) were studied. In unadjusted analyses, spending more than 30 minutes of time on social media, compared with no use, was associated with increased risk of internalizing problems alone (<= 30 minutes: relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94-1.78; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.36-2.64; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.74-3.49; >6 hours: RRR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.88-4.26) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (<= 30 minutes: RRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.83-3.00; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.43-4.09; >6 hours: RRR, 4.29; 95% CI, 3.22-5.73); associations with externalizing problems were inconsistent. In adjusted analyses, use of social media for more than 3 hours per day compared with no use remained significantly associated with internalizing problems alone (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11-2.31; >6 hours: RRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.77) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.51-2.66; >6 hours: RRR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.73-3.43) but not externalizing problems alone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per day using social media may be at heightened risk for mental health problems, particularly internalizing problems. Future research should determine whether setting limits on daily social media use, increasing media literacy, and redesigning social media platforms are effective means of reducing the burden of mental health problems in this population.",,,,,"Mojtabai, Ramin/AAL-5023-2020; Mojtabai, Ramin/D-7907-2012; Young, Andrea/D-8766-2015","Mojtabai, Ramin/0000-0002-2134-4043; Young, Andrea/0000-0002-8486-0643",,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-622X,2168-6238,,,,DEC,2019,76,12,,,,,1266,1273,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2325,,,,,,,,31509167,,,,,WOS:000505188200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied epidemiology workforce. Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020 through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included demographic details of participants, along with their technical background, level of formal education, topics studied during epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi(2)) to test the difference between categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to open-ended questions. Results In total, 282 people responded to the survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74% (n = 210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common. FETP graduates reported higher levels of formal training in all survey topics. Conclusion It is critical for the health security workforce to be well-trained and equipped with skills needed to ensure a rapid and effective response to acute public health events. Leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and specialist training in emergency response are lacking in current training models.

This event posed immense difficulties for healthcare nationally, with rural areas experiencing different challenges than other regions. Methods: The Association of Professionals in Infection Control & Epidemiology conducted focus groups with infection preventionist (IP) members in September and October, 2020. Zoom sessions were recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results: In all, 38 IPs who work at a critical access hospital or a healthcare facility in a rural location participated. Major challenges identified by IPs in this study included addressing the lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE), overwhelming workloads caused by the pandemic and multiple roles/ responsibilities, inaccurate social media messages, and generalized disbelief and disregard about the pandemic among rural community members. Conclusions: Gaps in preparedness identified in this study, such as the lack of PPE, need to be addressed to prevent occupational illness. In addition, health disparities and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 heard by IPs in this study need to be addressed in order to increase compliance with public health safeguards among rural community members and minimize morbidity and mortality in these regions.

However, prevalence estimates of hydrocephalus symptoms in young and middle-aged (YMA) adult patients are rare and variable. Highlighting the importance of hydrocephalus symptom management, the persistence and intensity of headache or gait disturbance have been associated with signs of brain white matter integrity loss, including in treated YMA adult patients. Thus, it is important to ascertain which symptoms adult patients with hydrocephalus report most to confirm their relative importance. METHODS: Observations of symptom complaints were made from publicly viewable online responses to an inquiry posted by the Hydrocephalus Association to 2 Facebook webpages. RESULTS: Within 7 days of inquiry posting, 381 complaints of signs and symptoms were identified in 82 online responses. Headache, cognitive deficits (cognition and memory), and mobility issues (dizziness, balance, or gait problems) were most commonly reported by 63%, 45%, and 40% of respondents, respectively. Results were highly similar for the subgroup of 53 patients reported as treated. For self-identified YMA patients (<60 years old), results were similar, but with fewer mobility complaints. Not previously reported, hypersensitivity to external stimuli was reported by one-half of the patients that reported headache. CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide further quantitative support for the prioritization of study of headache, cognitive deficits, and mobility issues in YMA adult patients with hydrocephalus.

This study analyzed the information on various Reddit social media groups dedicated to mental health. The classes, namely depression, anxiety, bipolar, and SuicideWatch, using the SWMH dataset have been analyzed. The text-based interactions of persons with mental illness have common motifs like negative language and expressions like 'hopelessness,' 'emptiness,' or 'helplessness.' Topic modeling identified recurring themes and subjects that helped classify discernible factors influencing mental health. Classifiers for multiclass classification to classify targeted mental health issues based on users' network behavior and posts were trained and tested to get predictions on context (e.g., MentalBERT) and non-context-based (e.g., LR and NB) models.

They will allow to identify critical hubs and routes of spreading of Influenza, in specific geographic locations, in order to contain infections and prevent complications, that require hospitalizations. Material and methods: Data were downloaded from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) - SID, New York State database. Patients hospitalized with flu complications, between 2003 and 2012 were included in the research (30,380 cases). A novel approach was designed, by constructing heatmaps for specific geographic regions in New York state and power law networks, in order to analyze distribution of hospitalized flu cases. Results: Heatmaps revealed that distributions of patients follow urban areas and big roads, indicating that flu spreads along routes, that people use to travel. A scale-free network, created from correlations among zip codes, discovered that, the highest populated zip codes didn't have the largest number of patients with flu complications. Among the top five most affected zip codes, four were in Bronx. Demographics of top affected zip codes were presented in results. Normalized numbers of cases per population revealed that, none of zip codes from Bronx were in the top 20. All zip codes with the highest node degrees were in New York City area. Discussion: Heatmaps identified geographic distribution of hospitalized flu patients and network analysis identified hubs of the infection. Our results will enable better estimation of resources for prevention and treatment of hospitalized patients with complications of Influenza. Conclusion: Analyses of geographic distribution of hospitalized patients with Influenza and demographic characteristics of populations, help us to make better planning and management of resources for Influenza patients, that require hospitalization. Obtained results could potentially help to save many lives and improve the health of the population.",,,,,,"Obradovic, Zoran/0000-0002-2051-0142; Ljubic, Branimir/0000-0002-3287-3741",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-0464,1532-0480,,,,MAY,2019,93,,,,,,,,103161,10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103161,,,,,,,,30940598,,,,,WOS:000525690500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

We introduce an information retrieval algorithm suitable to identify relevant subspaces of discussion on social media, for mining data from users showing explicit interest in discussions about opioid consumption in Reddit. Moreover, despite the pseudonymous nature of the user base, almost 1.5 million users were geolocated at the US state level, resembling the census population distribution with a good agreement. A measure of prevalence of interest in opiate consumption has been estimated at the state level, producing a novel indicator with information that is not entirely encoded in the standard surveillance.

With the greater uptake of orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable. This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects adolescents' social position in their peer networks using cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about their social relationships in school. These directed network data were used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19% of the surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology, epidemiology and medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1434-5293,1615-6714,,,,2023 DEC 19,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00056-023-00506-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00056-023-00506-x,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38112808,,,,,WOS:001127631200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we apply social information processing theory and incorporate (1) uncertainty of a treatment, (2) information exposure, and (3) credibility of the information source into patients' information evaluation function to assess how patients utilize shared health information and experiences. An empirical model, which combines various aspects of patients' firsthand experiences about treatments into a single construct, yields empirical evidence that patients' perceived treatment outcome is prone to social influence from other patients' shared experiences. By disaggregating the sources of social influence, we find that social influence created by generalized others in the community outweighs that by familiar others of one's intimate social group. In addition, we find that other factors, such as positive sentiment in comments and patients' prior experiences, also affect patients' perceived treatment outcome.

The current safety surveillance system relies on spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) and more recently on observational health data; however, ADR detection may be delayed and lack geographic diversity. The broad scope of social media conversations, such as those on Twitter, can include health-related topics. Consequently, these data could be used to detect potentially novel ADRs with less latency. Although research regarding ADR detection using social media has made progress, findings are based on single information sources, and no study has yet integrated drug safety evidence from both an SRS and Twitter. Objective The aim of this study was to combine signals from an SRS and Twitter to facilitate the detection of safety signals and compare the performance of the combined system with signals generated by individual data sources. Methods We extracted potential drug-ADR posts from Twitter, used Monte Carlo expectation maximization to generate drug safety signals from both the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and posts from Twitter, and then integrated these signals using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The results from the integrated system and two individual sources were evaluated using a reference standard derived from drug labels. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was computed to measure performance. Results We observed a significant improvement in the AUC of the combined system when comparing it with Twitter alone, and no improvement when comparing with the SRS alone. The AUCs ranged from 0.587 to 0.637 for the combined SRS and Twitter, from 0.525 to 0.534 for Twitter alone, and from 0.612 to 0.642 for the SRS alone. The results varied because different preprocessing procedures were applied to Twitter. Conclusion The accuracy of signal detection using social media can be improved by combining signals with those from SRSs. However, the combined system cannot achieve better AUC performance than data from FAERS alone, which may indicate that Twitter data are not ready to be integrated into a purely data-driven combination system.",,,,,,"Jimeno Yepes, Antonio Jose/0000-0002-6581-094X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0114-5916,1179-1942,,,,2020 SEP,2020,43,9,,,,,893,903,,10.1007/s40264-020-00943-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00943-2,,MAY 2020,,,,,,32385840,,,,,WOS:000531127600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although blockchain-based solutions have been suggested for sharing health information, it is still unclear whether a suitable incentive mechanism (intrinsic or extrinsic) can be identified to encourage individuals to share their sensitive data for research purposes. Objective: This study aimed to investigate how important extrinsic incentives are and what type of incentive is the best option in blockchain-based platforms designed for sharing sensitive health information. Methods: In this study, we conducted 3 experiments with 493 individuals to investigate the role of extrinsic incentives (ie, cryptocurrency, money, and recognition) in data sharing with research organizations. Results: The findings highlight that offering different incentives is insufficient to encourage individuals to use blockchain technology or to change their perceptions about the technology's premise for sharing sensitive health data. The results demonstrate that individuals still attribute serious risks to blockchain-based platforms. Privacy and security concerns, trust issues, lack of knowledge about the technology, lack of public acceptance, and lack of regulations are reported as top risks. In terms of attracting people to use blockchain-based platforms for data sharing in health care, we show that the effects of extrinsic motivations (cryptoincentives, money, and status) are significantly overshadowed by inhibitors to technology use. Conclusions: We suggest that before emphasizing the use of various types of extrinsic incentives, the users must be educated about the capabilities and benefits offered by this technology. Thus, an essential first step for shifting from an institution-based data exchange to a patient-centric data exchange (using blockchain) is addressing technology inhibitors to promote patient-driven data access control. This study shows that extrinsic incentives alone are inadequate to change users' perceptions, increase their trust, or encourage them to use technology for sharing health data.",,,,,,"Esmaeilzadeh, Pouyan/0000-0002-3885-8112; Mirzaei, Tala/0000-0002-4399-5832",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,AUG 18,2023,25,,,,,,,,e41805,10.2196/41805,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/41805,,,,,,,,37594783,,,,,WOS:001062240200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of using user-reported health data from cancer survivors and family members and friends on Twitter in Los Angeles (LA) County to enhance clinical trial recruitment. We focus on 6 cancer conditions (breast cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer). Methods: The social media intervention involved monitoring cancer-specific posts about the 6 cancer conditions by Twitter users in LA County to identify cancer survivors and their family members and friends and contacting eligible Twitter users with information about open cancer trials at the University of Southern California (USC) Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Approximately 12% (10/85) of the contacted users requested more information and 40% (4/10) set up a prescreening. Two eligible candidates were transferred to USC Norris for further screening, but neither was enrolled. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential of identifying and engaging cancer survivors and their family members and friends on Twitter. Optimization of downstream recruitment efforts such as screening for digital populations on social media may be required. Future research could test the feasibility of the approach for other diseases, locations, languages, social media platforms, and types of research involvement (eg, survey research). Computer science methods could help to scale up the analysis of larger data sets to support more rigorous testing of the intervention.",,,,,,"Buchanan, Thomas/0000-0001-7892-5132; Le, NamQuyen/0000-0002-5054-5362; Reuter, Katja/0000-0002-1559-9058",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,NOV,2021,5,11,,,,,,,e29958,10.2196/29958,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29958,,,,,,,,34842538,,,,,WOS:000853674900041,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whether the effects persisted at 6 months after the campaign remains to be determined. Methods: Mothers (N = 869) of daughters ages 14-17 in 34 states without bans on IT byminors were enrolled in a randomized trial. All mothers received an adolescent health campaign over 12months with posts on preventing IT (intervention) or prescription drug misuse (control). Mothers completed a follow-up at 18 months postrandomization measuring IT permissiveness, attitudes, intentions, communication, and behavior, and support for state bans. Daughters (n = 469; 54.0%) just completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that intervention-group mothers were less permissive of IT by daughters [unstandardized coefficient, -0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.31 to -0.03], had greater self-efficacy to refuse daughter's IT requests (0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.29) and lower IT intentions themselves (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01), and were more supportive of bans on IT by minors (0.23; 95% CI, 0.02-0.43) than control-group mothers. Intervention-group daughters expressed less positive IT attitudes than controls (-0.16; 95% CI, 0.31 to -0.01). Conclusions: The social media campaign may have had a persisting effect of convincing mothers to withhold permission for daughters to indoor tan for 6 months after its conclusion. Reduced IT intentions and increased support for bans on IT by minors also persisted among mothers.

The concepts of deep digital phenotyping and digital twins, which are based on the development of large cohort studies of extremely well characterized people with diabetes, will make it possible to further personalize the monitoring and management of the disease, thanks to a better integration of the impact of diabetes on people's daily lives. Similarly, the development of digital biomarkers, such as vocal biomarkers, will improve the remote monitoring of people with diabetes and thus allow the development of the telemonitoring and telemedicine of the future.

Design Cross-sectional mixed-method design. Participants 392 adults (361 surveys and 30 in-depth interviews (IDI)) from districts South, East and Korangi in Karachi, Pakistan. Main outcome measures Social media usage and knowledge, perception and behaviour towards COVID-19 infection and vaccination. Results Using social media was associated with an increased probability of getting vaccinated by 1.61 units. Most of the respondents (65%) reported using social media, mainly to watch videos and/or keep in touch with family/friends. 84.76% knew of COVID-19 while 88.37% knew about the COVID-19 vaccination, with 71.19% reported vaccine receipt; reasons to vaccinate included belief that vaccines protect from the virus, and vaccination being mandatory for work. However, only 56.7% of respondents believed they were at risk of disease. Of the 54 unvaccinated individuals, 27.78% did not vaccinate as they did not believe in COVID-19. Despite this, 78.38% of respondents scored high on vaccine confidence. In IDIs, most respondents knew about COVID-19 vaccines: 'This vaccine will create immunity in your body. Therefore, I think we should get vaccinated', and over half knew how COVID-19 spreads. Most considered COVID-19 a serious public health problem and thought it important that people get vaccinated. However, there was a low-risk perception of self as only a little over half felt that they were at risk of contracting COVID-19. Conclusion With our conflicting results regarding COVID-19 vaccine confidence, that is, high vaccine coverage but low perception of risk to self, it is likely that vaccine coverage is more a result of mandates and coercion than true vaccine confidence.

J,"Sleigh, J; Vayena, E",,,,"Sleigh, Joanna; Vayena, Effy",,,Public engagement with health data governance: the role of visuality,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over the last years, public engagement has become a topic of scholarly and policy debate particularly in biomedicine, a field that increasingly centres around collecting, sharing and analysing personal data. However, the use of big data in biomedicine poses specific challenges related to gaining public support for health data usage in research and clinical settings. The improvement of public engagement practices in health data governance is widely recognised as critical to address this issue. Based on OECD guidance, public engagement serves to enhance transparency and accountability, and enable citizens to actively participate in shaping what affects their lives. For health research initiatives, this provides a way to cultivate cooperation and build public trust. Today, the exact formats of public engagement have evolved to include approaches (such as social media, events and websites) that exploit visualisation mediated by emerging information and communication technologies. Much scholarship acknowledges the advantages of visuality for public engagement, particularly in information-dense and digital contexts. However, little research has examined how health data governance actors utilise visuality to promote clarity, understandability and audience participation. Beyond simply acknowledging the diversity of possible formats, attention must also be paid to visualisations' rhetorical capacity to convey arguments and ideas and motivate particular audiences in specific situations. This paper seeks to address this gap by analysing both the approaches and methods of argumentation used in two visual public engagement campaigns. Based on Gottweis' analytical framework of argumentative performativity, this paper explores how two European public engagement facilitators construct contending narratives in efforts to make sense of and grapple with the challenges of health data sharing. Specifically, we analyse how their campaigns employ the three rhetorical elements logos, ethos and pathos, proposed by Gottweis to assess communicative practices, intermediated and embedded in symbolically rich social and cultural contexts. In doing so, we highlight how visual techniques of argumentation seek to bolster engagement but vary with rhetorical purposes, as while one points to health data sharing risks, the other focuses on benefits. Moreover, drawing on digital and visual anthropology, we reflect on how the digitalisation of communicative practices impacts visual power.",,,,,"Vayena, Effy/ABD-8272-2021","Vayena, Effy/0000-0003-1303-5467",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2662-9992,,,,JUN 18,2021,8,1,,,,,,,149,10.1057/s41599-021-00826-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00826-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000664141500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The calculation of this parameter is a challenge for epidemiologists, since transmission can occur through multiple pathways. The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16 proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions, including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within this network. The results show a high connection between species through indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock.

In particular, in the health area, social networks represent a channel to communicate and disseminate novel treatments' success; they also allow ordinary people to express their concerns about a disease or disorder. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has developed analytical methods to uncover and predict patterns from posts that enable it to explain news about a particular topic, e.g., mental disorders expressed as eating disorders or depression. Albeit potentially rich while expressing an idea or concern, posts are presented as short texts, preventing, thus, AI models from accurately encoding these posts' contextual knowledge. We propose a hybrid approach where knowledge encoded in community-maintained knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata) is combined with deep learning to categorize social media posts using existing classification models. The proposed approach resorts to state-of-the-art named entity recognizers and linkers (e.g., Falcon 2.0) to extract entities in short posts and link them to concepts in knowledge graphs. Then, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) are utilized to compute latent representations of the extracted entities, which result in vector representations of the posts that encode these entities' contextual knowledge extracted from the knowledge graphs. These KGEs are combined with contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT) to generate a context-based representation of the posts that empower prediction models. We apply our proposed approach in the health domain to detect whether a publication is related to an eating disorder (e.g., anorexia or bulimia) and uncover concepts within the discourse that could help healthcare providers diagnose this type of mental disorder. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders. Our experimental results suggest that combining contextual knowledge encoded in word embeddings with the one built from knowledge graphs increases the reliability of the predictive models. The ambition is that the proposed method can support health domain experts in discovering patterns that may forecast a mental disorder, enhancing early detection and more precise diagnosis towards personalized medicine.",,,,,"Benítez Andrades, José Alberto/M-1195-2017","Benítez Andrades, José Alberto/0000-0002-4450-349X; Russo, Mayra/0000-0001-7080-6331",,,,,,,,,,,,,1570-0844,2210-4968,,,,,2023,14,5,,,SI,,873,892,,10.3233/SW-223269,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/SW-223269,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000981666700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data. Besides, the public, who is the data source, always expects the security, privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can avoid contributing their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as the public is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of precision health diminishes.

Design: Retrospective content analysis. Setting: Social media platform, Facebook. Participants: Social media posts on Facebook endometriosis pages. Interventions: A search of public Facebook pages was performed using the key word endometriosis. Posts from the month-long study period were categorized and analyzed for accuracy. Two independent researchers used thematic evaluation to place posts into the following 11 categories: educational, emotional support, advocacy, discussion, events, humor, promotional, recipes, resources, surveys, and other. Posts categorized as educational were further subcategorized and reviewed. Each posted fact was cross-referenced in peer-reviewed scientific journals to determine whether the claim made was evidence-based. Engagement in a post was calculated by taking the sum of comments, shares, and reactions. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 53 Facebook pages meeting inclusion criteria were identified and 1464 posts from the study period were evaluated. Emotional support posts comprised the largest category of posts (48%) followed by educational posts (21%). Within the educational category, the epidemiology and pathophysiology subcategory comprised the largest group (42.0%) followed by the symptom's subcategory (19.6%). Post category had an effect on the amount of post engagement (p-value <.001) with emotional posts generating 70% of the overall engagement. The subcategories of the educational posts demonstrated a similar effect on engagement (p-value <.001). Posts were more engaging if they contained epidemiology and pathophysiology information with 44% of all engagement of educational posts occurring within this subcategory. Educational posts were found to be 93.93% accurate. There was no correlation between post engagement and post information accuracy (p-value = .312). Conclusion: Facebook pages offer emotional support and education to people with endometriosis. Most information found in these Facebook pages is evidence-based.

Using Monkeypox as an application case, this study examines differences among platforms based on four factors: user characteristics, text topics, text emotion, and text quality. The modeling and regression results reveal significant heterogeneity in public opinion expressions across different platforms, particularly between long-text and short-text platforms. Users on short-text platforms are more exposed to diverse information and tend to be susceptible to emotionally provocative content. On the other hand, users on long-text platforms prefer in-depth discussions and show greater receptivity to content infused with positive emotions.

Study Design and Setting: Systematic literature searches about psoriasis interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review, methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension, structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media diffusion. Results: We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality: a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower quality. Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader social media visibility and article usage.

To advance the use of social media data as a complementary resource for epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we present a data set of 6487 tweets that mention miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or premature labor, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care, or fetal/infant loss in general. These tweets are a subset of 22,912 tweets retrieved by applying hand-written regular expressions to a database containing more than 400 million public tweets posted by more than 100,000 women who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter [7]. Two professional annotators labeled the 6487 tweets in a binary fashion, distinguishing those potentially reporting that the user has personally experienced the outcome (outcome tweets) from those that merely mention the outcome (non-outcome tweets). Inter-annotator agreement was kappa = 0.90 (Cohen's kappa). The tweets annotated as outcome include 1318 women reporting miscarriage, 94 stillbirth, 591 preterm birth or premature labor, 171 low birthweight, 453 neonatal intensive care, and 356 fetal/infant loss in general. These outcome tweets can be used to explore patient experiences and perceptions of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can direct researchers to the users' broader timelines-tweets posted by a user over time for observational studies. Our past work demonstrates the analysis of timelines for selecting a study population [8] and conducting a case-control study [9] of users reporting that their child has a birth defect. For larger-scale studies, the full annotated corpus can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically identify additional users reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on Twitter. We used the annotated corpus to train feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers presented in A natural language processing pipeline to advance the use of Twitter data for digital epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes [10].

With many government organizations actively employing social media data in recent times, the need for processing public concerns on social media has become a critical topic of interest across academic scholars and practitioners. However, the growing volume of social media data makes it difficult to process all the issues under a single umbrella, causing to overlook the main topic of interest within communication technologies, such as privacy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, arguments on privacy and health issues exploded on Twitter, with several threads centered on contact tracking, health data gathering, and its usage by government agencies. To address the challenges of rising data volumes and to understand the importance of privacy concerns, particularly among users seeking greater privacy protection during this pandemic, we conduct a focused empirical analysis of user tweets about privacy. In this two-part research, our first study reveals three macro privacy issues of discussion distilled from the Twitter corpus, subsequently subdivided into 12 user privacy categories. The second study builds on the findings of the first study, focusing on the primary difficulties highlighted in the macro privacy subjects-contact tracing and digital surveillance.

However, as a collision sport, rugby research and media coverage predominantly focus on injuries in elite players while the overall impact on health and well-being remains unclear. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of rugby participation in a diverse sample of men and women, current and former rugby Union and League players from recreational to the elite level of play. We will explore: (1) joint-specific injuries and concussion; (2) joint pain and osteoarthritis (OA); (3) medical and mental health conditions; (4) PA and sedentary behaviour and (5) well-being (quality of life, flourishing and resilience). Methods and analysis The Rugby Health and Well-being Study is designed in two phases: (1) a UK-wide cross-sectional survey and (2) cross-validation using health register data from Scotland. Participants will be at least 16 years old, current or former rugby players who have played rugby for at least one season. We will report standardised, level of play-, sex- and age-stratified prevalence of joint injury, concussion, medical conditions and PA. We will describe injury/concussion prevention expectations and protective equipment use. Rugby-related factors associated with injury, pain, OA, PA, health and well-being will be explored in regression models. We will compare joint pain intensity and duration, elements of pain perception and well-being between recreational and elite players and further investigate these associations in regression models while controlling for confounding variables. In the second phase, we will validate self-reported with health register data, and provide further information on healthcare use.

The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of patients with Covid-19 toward sharing their health data for research and their concerns about security and privacy. MethodsThis survey is a cross-sectional study conducted through an electronic researcher-made questionnaire from February to May 2021. Convenience sampling was applied to select the participants and all 475 patients were referred to two to Afzalipour and Shahid Bahonar hospitals were invited to the study. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 204 patients were included in the study and completed the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, and standard deviation) were used to analyze the questionnaire data. SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. ResultsParticipants tended to share information about comments provided by individuals on websites (68.6%), fitness tracker data (64.19%), and online shopping history (63.21%) before death. Participants also tended to share information about electronic medical records data (36.75%), genetic data (24.99%), and Instagram data (24.99%) after death. Fraud or misuse of personal information (4.48 [+/- 1.27]) was the most common concern of participants regarding the virtual world.

We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID-19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. <= 0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID-19 response plans as soon as permitting.",,,,,"Bogoch, Isaac/AAS-9631-2020","Bisanzio, Donal/0000-0002-7832-2291; Reithinger, Richard/0000-0001-5710-1556",,,,,,,,,,,,,1827-1987,1970-7096,,,,,2020,15,1,,,,,19,24,882,10.4081/gh.2020.882,http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/gh.2020.882,,,,,,,,32575957,,,,,WOS:000567337900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the impacts of news on information-seeking behaviors have been remained unknown. Methods: Data employed in this research provided from two sources, (1) Parsijoo search engine query logs of 48 months, and (2) a set of documents of 28 months of Parsijoo's news service. Two classes of topics, i.e. macrotopics and micro-topics were selected to be tracked in query logs and news. Keywords of the macro-topics were automatically generated using web provided resources and exceeded 10k. Keyword set of micro-topics were limited to a numerable list including terms related to diseases and health-related activities. The tests are established in the form of three studies. Study A includes temporal analyses of 7 macro-topics in query logs. Study B considers analyzing seasonality of searching patterns of 9 micro-topics, and Study C assesses the impact of news media coverage on users' health-related information-seeking behaviors. Results: Study A showed that the hourly distribution of various macro-topics followed the changes in social activity level. Conversely, the interestingness of macro-topics did not follow the regulation of topic distributions. Among macro-topics, Pharmacotherapy has highest interestingness level and wider time-window of popularity. In Study B, seasonality of a limited number of diseases and health-related activities were analyzed. Trends of infectious diseases, such as flu, mumps and chicken pox were seasonal. Due to seasonality of most of diseases covered in national vaccination plans, the trend belonging to Immunization and Vaccination was seasonal, as well. Cancer awareness events caused peaks in search trends of Cancer and Screening micro-topics in specific days of each year that mimic repeated patterns which may mistakenly be identified as seasonality. In study C, we assessed the co-integration and correlation between news and query trends. Our results demonstrated that microtopics sparsely covered in news media had lowest level of impressiveness and, subsequently, the lowest impact on users' intents. Conclusion: Our results can reveal public reaction to social events, diseases and prevention procedures. Furthermore, we found that news trends are co-integrated with search queries and are able to reveal health-related events; however, they cannot be used interchangeably.

Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430 birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of connectivity, namely for MAA.

This study aims to examine participants' social media use and comfort sharing their data with health researchers. One hundred and sixty-one participants with medical conditions were recruited through social media paid advertisements and referral from a website, and invited to complete surveys on social media use and ethical perspectives on data sharing. Eligibility criteria were adults 18 years old or older, living in the US, self-reported having been diagnosed by a physician with a medical condition, belonging to at least one social media platform, using social media at least twice a week, and owning a smartphone. Study participants were mostly female, White, and with a mean age of 36.31 years. More than one third of participants reported being very comfortable sharing electronic health data and social media data for personalized healthcare and to help others. Findings suggest that participants are very uncomfortable sharing their location and text message data with researchers, with primary concerns centered around loss of privacy, disclosing private information, and that friends, family, and others may find out that they shared text messages with researchers.

However, true case estimations have been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity, asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care. Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize, and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also evaluated model performance. From 4,492,954 tweets collected, the unsupervised learning process yielded 3,465 (<1%) symptom tweets used to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11,550). The XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62) compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in identification of an additional 2,622 symptom-related tweets when applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected.

However, although studying the association between psychological disorders and musical preference is considered as rather an old tradition in the clinical analysis of health data, it is not explored through the lens of social media analytics. In this study, we investigate which attributes of the music posted on social media are associated with mental health conditions of Twitter users. We created a large-scale dataset of 1519 Twitter users with six self-reported psychological disorders (depression, bipolar, anxiety, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline) and matched with 2480 control users. We then conduct an observational study to investigate the relationship between the users' psychological disorders and their musical preference by analyzing lyrics of the music tracks that the users shared on Twitter from multiple dimensions including word usage, linguistic style, sentiment and emotion patterns, topical interests and underlying semantics. Our findings reveal descriptive differences on the linguistic and semantic features of music tracks of affected users compared to control individuals and among users from different psychological disorders. Additionally, we build a feature-based and an (explainable) deep learning-based binary classifiers trained on disorder and control users and demonstrate that lyrics of the music tracks of users on Twitter can be considered as complementary information to their published posts to improve the accuracy of the disorder detection task. Overall, we find that the music attributes of users on Twitter allow inferences about their mental health status.",,,,,"etminani, kobra/F-1929-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4573,1873-5371,,,,MAY,2023,60,3,,,,,,,103269,10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103269,,JAN 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000927354900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many people with symptoms of depression still remain untreated or undiagnosed. Social media may be a tool to help researchers and clinicians to identify and support individuals who experience depression. More than 394,000,000 postings were collected from China's most popular social media website, Sina Weibo. 1000 randomly selected depression-related postings was coded and analyzed to learn the themes of these postings, and a text classifier was built to identify the postings indicating depression. The identified depressed users were compared with the general population on demographic characteristics, diurnal patterns, and patterns of emoticon usage. We found that disclosure of depression was the most popular theme; depression displayers were more engaged with social media compared to non-depression displayers, the depression postings showed geographical variations, depression displayers tended to be active during periods of leisure and sleep, and depression displayers used negative emoticons more frequently than non-depression displayers.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online panel survey of 469 adolescents aged 15-19 years residing in four states with legal retail cannabis for adult use. Adolescents self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing on social or traditional media (i.e., outdoor or print) and past-year cannabis use. Logistic regression generated estimated odds of youths' past-year cannabis use by marketing exposure after adjusting for demographic factors and cannabis-related social norms. Results: Exposure to cannabis marketing on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram was associated with increased odds of past-year cannabis use of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15%-234%), 88% (95% CI: 11%-219%), and 129% (95% CI: 32%-287%), respectively. Odds of past-year cannabis use increased by 48% (95% CI: 16%-87%) with each additional social media platform where adolescents reported exposure. Conclusions: Despite restrictions that prohibit cannabis advertising on social media, adolescents are exposed to cannabis marketing via social media, and this exposure is associated with recent cannabis use. States should consider further regulation of cannabis marketing on social media. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Twitter can provide valuable insight into trends, colloquial information available to potential users, and how networks and interactivity might influence what people are exposed to and how they engage in communication around drug use. Objective: This exploratory study was designed to investigate the ways in which unsupervised machine learning analyses using natural language processing could identify coherent themes for tweets containing substance names. Methods: This study involved harnessing data from Twitter, including large-scale collection of brand name (N=262,607) and street name (N=204,068) prescription drug-related tweets and use of unsupervised machine learning analyses (ie, natural language processing) of collected data with data visualization to identify pertinent tweet themes. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with coherence score calculations was performed to compare brand (eg, OxyContin) and street (eg, oxys) name tweets. Results: We found people discussed drug use differently depending on whether a brand name or street name was used. Brand name categories often contained political talking points (eg, border, crime, and political handling of ongoing drug mitigation strategies). In contrast, categories containing street names occasionally referenced drug misuse, though multiple social uses for a term (eg, Sonata) muddled topic clarity. Conclusions: Content in the brand name corpus reflected discussion about the drug itself and less often reflected personal use. However, content in the street name corpus was notably more diverse and resisted simple LDA categorization. We speculate this may reflect effective use of slang terminology to clandestinely discuss drug-related activity. If so, straightforward analyses of digital drug-related communication may be more difficult than previously assumed. This work has the potential to be used for surveillance and detection of harmful drug use information. It also might be used for appropriate education and dissemination of information to persons engaged in drug use content on Twitter.",,,,,"Eddens, Katherine/HLH-8488-2023; Parker, Maria/AAE-3802-2022; Agley, Jon/AAA-6758-2021","Eddens, Katherine/0000-0002-7783-4156; Parker, Maria/0000-0002-9763-1129; Agley, Jon/0000-0003-2345-8850; Valdez, Danny/0000-0002-2355-9881; Rao, Varun/0009-0008-7704-1974",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUL 28,2023,25,,,,,,,,e48405,10.2196/48405,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/48405,,,,,,,,37505795,,,,,WOS:001048390000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life. Methods/Results: In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago. Conclusions: Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

Methods: We collected all Zika-related tweets during the 3 months immediately after the first U.S. case of Zika. After the tweets were categorized into 12 themes, a cross-section were grouped into weekly datasets. to capture 12 amplifier/user groups, and analyzed by 4 amplification modes: mentions, retweets, talkers. and Twitter-wide amplifiers. Results: We analyzed 3.057,130 tweets in the United States and categorized 4997 users. The most talked about theme was Zika transmission (similar to 58%). News media, public health institutions, and grassroots users were the most visible and frequent sources and disseminators of Zika-related Twitter content. Grassroots users were the primary sources and disseminators of conspiracy theories. Conclusions: Social media analytics enable public health institutions to quickly learn what information is being disseminated, and by whom, regarding infectious diseases. Such information can help public health institutions identify and engage with news media and other active information providers. It also provides insights into media and public concerns, accuracy of information on Twitter, and information gaps.

However, there remains a knowledge gap in understanding the barriers faced by this community in receiving HIV care and prevention resources. To address this, the Keeping it LITE study was conducted to assess HIV risk factors and barriers to preventive treatment in a large national cohort of young sexual minority men and transgender individuals at high risk of HIV infection. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling a large remote cohort, challenges encountered in recruitment, and adjustments made to address these challenges. Methods: A large national cohort (n=3444) of young sexual minority men and transgender individuals were recruited. Participants were recruited via advertisements on social media; social apps for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals; print advertising; and word-of-mouth. Before enrolling, participants verified their HIV status using an at-home HIV test or by providing their own testing documentation. Descriptive statistics were generated, and a series of logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate demographic differences between recruitment methods, HIV testing methods, and enrollment status. Results: The Keeping it LITE study was particularly successful in recruiting participants via social media, with over half of the participants recruited from advertisements on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Participants were also recruited via word-of-mouth; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer apps (ie, Grindr, Scruff); and print advertisements, and participants recruited from these sources tended to be older and have a higher risk profile. The study was also successful in recruiting a large sample of transgender youth, particularly transgender men and nonbinary individuals. At-home HIV testing was acceptable and more heavily used by younger participants, although several barriers were encountered and overcome in the implementation of this testing. The study had more limited success in recruiting participants aged 13-17 years because of lower enrollment rates and barriers to advertising on social media platforms. The implications of these findings for the future development of HIV research and intervention protocols among sexual minorities and trans youth are discussed.

The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the literature on the use of Instagram as an infodemiological tool in oral health research. Methods: A scoping review approach was carried out. MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases, together with medRxiv and JMIR Publications platforms, were searched for studies representing oral health research which employed Instagram as a tool to obtain at least part of the results. Three independent reviewers performed the study screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out according to the way which Instagram was used in research. Results: We included 30 reports describing 28 studies. The approaches for using Instagram in oral health research were post's content analysis (13 reports), infoveillance (six reports), sample recruitment (five reports) and as a platform to deliver an exposure or intervention (six reports). Four reports were published in 2019, 13 in 2020 and 13 in 2021. Topics related to patient experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and ethical compliance were highlighted. Conclusions: We described new opportunities in this growing field by the identification of four main uses of Instagram in oral health research and encourage dental professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge translation in this social media. Future studies using Instagram as a data source must improve search and evaluation quality. Public Interest Summary: Infodemiology (information epidemiology) is a growing field in public health research and the interest in Instagram social media has increased during the pandemic scenario. On the light of these aspects, a literature overview may be important to describe new opportunities for researchers. Using a scoping review approach, we found that Instagram can be used in oral health research as a source to content analysis and information surveillance, as well as a platform to sample recruitment and to deliver an exposure or intervention. Topics related to patient experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and ethical compliance were highlighted in the included studies. Our results may help to delineate further research using Instagram and encourage dental professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge translation in this social media.

We aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA. Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms. Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201, 100%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6%) and popularity (n=110, 54.7%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for 'similarity on popularity' (within the 'similarity' category) to 28 for the 'characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and nominated peers' (within the 'nature of the relationships' category). Using the examples of 'social isolation', 'group membership', 'individuals in a central position' (within the 'position within the network' category) and 'nominations of influential peers' (sub within the 'popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public health intervention based on SNA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-005X,1470-2738,,,,2024 JAN 30,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1136/jech-2023-220980,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2023-220980,,JAN 2024,,,,,,38290822,,,,,WOS:001153345300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: This study was an online cross-sectional survey of calisthenics athletes. Data were collected online and the survey was distributed via social media over six months in 2020. The purpose-built survey consisted of demographic, training and loading questions. Participants were provided with an injury definition and reported their total number of injuries sustained during calisthenics including detailed information on three most significant injuries, along with mechanism of injury and risk factors. Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine objective factors associated with the number of injuries. Results: There were 543 participants describing 1104 injuries. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) injury prevalence was 4.5 (3.3) per person. Of these injuries, 820 (74.3%) required training modification or treatment. Participants missed a mean (SD) 3.4 (5.1) weeks of training and engaged in a mean (SD) 10.9 (9.1) health professional consultations. The most common injuries were upper leg (24.5%), ankle/foot (22.8%) and lumbar spine (19.3%), with the majority being sprains/strains in nature (56.3%). Mechanism of injury included elevated work (27.6%), overuse (38.0%) and specific calisthenics skills (38.9%) - such as lumbar (40.6%) and lower limb (40.3%) extension-based movements. Subjective risk factors included load (66.8%), preparation (55.9%) and environmental factors (21.0%). Objective risk factors associated with higher numbers of injuries included increased years of participation, left leg dominance, increased training hours (regardless of training type) and state team participation (p<0.05). Conclusion: Practitioners need to be aware that calisthenics athletes demonstrate a high proportion of strain/sprain injuries involving the lower limb and lumbar spine with causative movements being extension-based.

The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees.

Media surveillance is useful to capture unstructured information about outbreaks. We established media surveillance and described the characteristics of the COVID-19 cases, clusters, deaths by time, place, and person during January-March 2020 in India. Methods: The media surveillance team of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology abstracted data from public domains of India's Central and State health ministries, online news and social media platforms for the period of January 31 to March 26, 2020. We collected data on person (socio-demographics, circumstances of travel/contact, clinical and laboratory), time (date/period of reported exposures; laboratory confirmation and death) and place (location). We drew epidemic curve, described frequencies of cases by age and gender. We described available details for identified clusters. Results: As of March 26, 2020, India reported 694 (Foreigners = 45, 6%) confirmed COVID-19 cases (Attack rate = 0.5 per million population) and 17 deaths (Fatality = 2.5%) from 21 States and 6 Union Territories. The cases were higher among 20-59 years of age (60 of 85) and male gender (65 of 107). Median age at death was 68 years (Range: 38-85 years).

However, there is a lack of web-based research on the accuracy and validity of self-reported diagnostic information available on the web.Objective: An analysis of the degree of correspondence between self-reported diagnoses and clinical indicators will afford researchers and clinicians higher levels of trust in social media analyses. We hypothesized that self-reported diagnoses would correspond to validated disorder-specific severity questionnaires across 2 large web-based samples.Methods: The participants of study 1 were 1123 adults from a national Qualtrics panel (mean age 34.65, SD 12.56 years; n=635, 56.65% female participants,). The participants of study 2 were 2237 college students from a large university in the Midwest (mean age 19.08, SD 2.75 years; n=1761, 75.35% female participants). All participants completed a web-based survey on their mental health, social media use, and demographic information. Additionally, the participants reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with a series of disorders, with the option of selecting Yes; No, but I should be; I don't know; or No for each condition. We conducted a series of ANOVA tests to determine whether there were differences among the 4 diagnostic groups and used post hoc Tukey tests to examine the nature of the differences.Results: In study 1, for self-reported mania (F3,1097=2.75; P=.04), somatic symptom disorder (F3,1060=26.75; P<.001), and alcohol use disorder (F3,1097=77.73; P<.001), the pattern of mean differences did not suggest that the individuals were accurate in their self-diagnoses. In study 2, for all disorders but bipolar disorder (F3,659=1.43; P=.23), ANOVA results were consistent with our expectations. Across both studies and for most conditions assessed, the individuals who said that they had been diagnosed with a disorder had the highest severity scores on self-report questionnaires, but this was closely followed by individuals who had not been diagnosed but believed that they should be diagnosed. This was especially true for depression, generalized anxiety, and insomnia. For mania and bipolar disorder, the questionnaire scores did not differentiate individuals who had been diagnosed from those who had not.Conclusions: In general, if an individual believes that they should be diagnosed with an internalizing disorder, they are experiencing a degree of psychopathology similar to those who have already been diagnosed. Self-reported diagnoses correspond well with symptom severity on a continuum and can be trusted as clinical indicators, especially in common internalizing disorders such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Researchers can put more faith into patient self-reports, including those in web-based experiments such as social media posts, when individuals report diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders.

Though much of Facebook's data are not available to outsiders, the company provides a tool for estimating the audience of Facebook advertisements, which includes aggregated information on the demographics and interests, such as weight loss or dieting, of Facebook users. This paper explores the potential uses of Facebook ad audience estimates for eHealth by studying the following: (1) for what type of health conditions prevalence estimates can be obtained via social media and (2) what type of marker interests are useful in obtaining such estimates, which can then be used for recruitment within online health interventions. Objective: The objective of this study was to understand the limitations and capabilities of using Facebook ad audience estimates for public health monitoring and as a recruitment tool for eHealth interventions. Methods: We use the Facebook Marketing application programming interface to correlate estimated sizes of audiences having health-related interests with public health data. Using several study cases, we identify both potential benefits and challenges in using this tool. Results: We find several limitations in using Facebook ad audience estimates, for example, using placebo interest estimates to control for background level of user activity on the platform. Some Facebook interests such as plus-size clothing show encouraging levels of correlation (r=.74) across the 50 US states; however, we also sometimes find substantial correlations with the placebo interests such as r=.68 between interest in Technology and Obesity prevalence. Furthermore, we find demographic-specific peculiarities in the interests on health-related topics. Conclusions: Facebook's advertising platform provides aggregate data for more than 190 million US adults. We show how disease-specific marker interests can be used to model prevalence rates in a simple and intuitive manner. However, we also illustrate that building effective marker interests involves some trial-and-error, as many details about Facebook's black box remain opaque.",,,,,"Weber, Ingmar/AAE-6909-2020; Fernandez-Luque, Luis/C-6723-2011","Weber, Ingmar/0000-0003-4169-2579; Fernandez-Luque, Luis/0000-0001-8165-9904; Mejova, Yelena/0000-0001-5560-4109",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,JAN-MAR,2018,4,1,,,,,15,30,e30,10.2196/publichealth.7217,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7217,,,,,,,,29592849,,,,,WOS:000526815300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Study design We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (Year 2, 2018-2020; N = 8753). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary language, household income, parental education) and adolescent-reported problematic video game (Video Game Addiction Questionnaire), social media (Social Media Addiction Questionnaire), and mobile phone use (Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire). Results Boys reported higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Having unmarried/unpartnered parents was associated with higher problematic social media use. Although higher household income was generally protective against problematic video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents (p for interaction <0.05). Conclusions Given the sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use, digital literacy education strategies can focus on at-risk populations, encourage targeted counseling by pediatricians, and adapt family media use plans for diverse backgrounds. Impact While sociodemographic differences in screen time are documented, we examined sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use in a large, diverse sample of early adolescents in the US. Boys reported higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Although higher household income was generally protective against problematic video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents. Beyond time spent on screens, pediatricians, parents, and educators should be aware of sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use.",,,,,"Baker, Fiona/JLL-2049-2023","Baker, Fiona/0000-0001-9602-6165",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-3998,1530-0447,,,,2022 NOV,2022,92,5,,,,,1443,1449,,10.1038/s41390-022-02176-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02176-8,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35768491,,,,,WOS:000818678300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we exploit social media on a larger scale by developing natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically detect, among thousands of users, a cohort of mothers reporting that their child has a birth defect. We used 22,999 annotated tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms-feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers-that automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user's pregnancy outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90% of the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two positive classes: an F-1-score of 0.65 for the defect class and 0.51 for the possible defect class. We deployed the classifier on 20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort. Contributions of this study include (1) NLP methods for automatically detecting tweets by users reporting their birth defect outcomes, (2) findings that an SVM classifier can outperform a deep neural network-based classifier for highly imbalanced social media data, (3) evidence that automatic classification can be used to identify additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort, and (4) a publicly available corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms.",,,,,"Sarker, Abeed/W-1044-2019","Sarker, Abeed/0000-0001-7358-544X; Gonzalez Hernandez, Graciela/0000-0002-6416-9556",,,,,,,,,,,,,2398-6352,,,,,OCT 1,2019,2,,,,,,,,96,10.1038/s41746-019-0170-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0170-5,,,,,,,,31583284,,,,,WOS:000488612700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic.MethodsTweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities.ResultsFrom an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased.ConclusionResults from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.",,,,,"Li, Jiaxi/HTS-3430-2023; Li, Jiawei/GXM-4151-2022; li, jiawei/HOA-5023-2023","Li, Jiaxi/0000-0002-8197-8590; Cuomo, Raphael/0000-0002-8179-0619",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,APR 24,2021,21,1,,,,,,,793,10.1186/s12889-021-10827-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10827-4,,,,,,,,33894745,,,,,WOS:000647187100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used multivariable regression to examine relationships between age, racial/ethnic identity, educational attainment, income, insurance type, region, and COVID-19 related hardship, and ability to obtain a contraceptive appointment, telehealth vs in-person visits, and telehealth quality scores.Results: Among 2031 respondents seeking a contraception visit, 1490 (73.4%) reported any visit, of which 530 (35.6%) were telehealth. In adjusted analyses, lower odds of any visit was associated with Hispanic/ Latinx and Mixed race/Other identity (aOR 0.59 [0.37-0.94], aOR 0.36 [0.22-0.59], respectively), the South, Midwest, Northeast (aOR 0.63 [0.47-0.85], aOR 0.64 [0.46-0.90], aOR 0.52 [CI 0.36-0.75], respectively), no insurance (aOR 0.63 [0.43-0.91]), greater COVID-19 hardship (aOR 0.52 [0.31-0.87]), and earlier pandemic timing (January 2021 vs July 2020 aOR 2.14 [1.69-2.70]). Respondents from the Midwest and South had lower odds of telehealth vs in-person care (aOR 0.63 [0.44-0.88], aOR 0.54 [0.40-0.72], respectively). Hispanic/Latinx respondents and those in the Midwest had lower odds of high telehealth quality (aOR 0.37 [0.17-0.80], aOR 0.58 [0.35-0.95], respectively).Conclusions: We found inequities in contraceptive care access, less telehealth use for contraception visits in the South and Midwest, and lower telehealth quality among Hispanic/Latinx people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should focus on telehealth access, quality, and patients' preferences. Implications: Historically marginalized groups have faced disproportionate barriers to contraceptive care, and telehealth for contraceptive care has not been employed equitably during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles outbreak. Results: News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4%), followed by personal opinions (33.7%), resources (19.4%), personal experiences (2.5%), and questions (1.6%). Susceptibility was the most discussed health belief (21.8%), followed by cues to action (18.9%) and severity (13.0%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more likely to link to emerging news websites. Conclusions: Understanding who posts what on social media during an infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide timely and effective information.

The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55%). Backyard producers made up 89% of the network premises, and the top 2% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes.

We summarized the global epidemiology and public health response to meningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM.Recent FindingsAt least ten outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease among MSM have been reported since 2001. Investigation of and response to outbreaks among MSM have often been hampered by an inability to identify epidemiologic links among cases, and the target population recommended for vaccination has been expanded over time in many outbreaks. Unique communication methods, including the use of apps and social media, have been used during some outbreaks to identify close contacts and to communicate health messages. Although HIV-infected MSM have a higher risk of sporadic meningococcal disease in the USA, other factors are likely contributing to outbreaks among MSM. An increase in urethritis due to Neisseria meningitidis has recently been reported in US men, though its role in meningococcal disease transmission among MSM remains unclear.SummaryMeningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM raise questions regarding possible unique risk factors in this population. The role of HIV infection and mode of N. meningitidis transmission are being investigated to provide further insights into meningococcal disease and outbreaks in this population.

Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis. Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95% confidence interval, .97-1.0). Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.",,,,,"Sharma, Meenu/AAE-2536-2022; Cameron, Bill/E-9180-2010; Sharma, Meenu/GWM-5030-2022","Sharma, Meenu/0000-0002-6020-9995; Cameron, Bill/0000-0002-0090-3539; Pakhale, Smita/0000-0002-4051-962X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1058-4838,1537-6591,,,,JUN 15,2021,72,12,,,,,2187,2195,,10.1093/cid/ciaa420,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa420,,,,,,,,32293676,,,,,WOS:000670819400065,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because the time to respond is short for acute disease events, an algorithm based on time between events has shown promise. Shorter the time between consecutive incidents of the disease, more likely the outbreak. Social media posts such as tweets can be used as input to the monitoring algorithm. However, due to the large volume of tweets, a large number of alerts may be produced. We refer to this problem as alert swamping. Methods: We present a four-step architecture for the early detection of the acute disease event, using social media posts (tweets) on Twitter. To curb alert swamping, the first three steps of the algorithm ensure the relevance of the tweets. The fourth step is a monitoring algorithm based on time between events. We experiment with a dataset of tweets posted in Melbourne from 2014 to 2016, focusing on the thunderstorm asthma outbreak in Melbourne in November 2016. Results: Out of our 18 experiment combinations, three detected the thunderstorm asthma outbreak up to 9 hours before the time mentioned in the official report, and five were able to detect it before the first news report.

Specifically, understanding the characteristics of negative sentiment could help inform federal disease control agencies' efforts to disseminate relevant information to the public about Zika-related issues. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the public sentiment concerning Zika using posts on Twitter and determine the qualitative characteristics of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed. Methods: Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used to analyze the sentiment of tweets concerning Zika. A supervised machine learning classifier was built to classify tweets into 3 sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Tweets in each category were then examined using a topic-modeling approach to determine the main topics for each category, with focus on the negative category. Results: A total of 5303 tweets were manually annotated and used to train multiple classifiers. These performed moderately well (F1 score=0.48-0.68) with text-based feature extraction. All 48,734 tweets were then categorized into the sentiment categories. Overall, 10 topics for each sentiment category were identified using topic modeling, with a focus on the negative sentiment category. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how sentiment expressed within discussions of epidemics on Twitter can be discovered. This allows public health officials to understand public sentiment regarding an epidemic and enables them to address specific elements of negative sentiment in real time. Our negative sentiment classifier was able to identify tweets concerning Zika with 3 broad themes: neural defects,Zika abnormalities, and reports and findings. These broad themes were based on domain expertise and from topics discussed in journals such as Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and Vaccine. As the majority of topics in the negative sentiment category concerned symptoms, officials should focus on spreading information about prevention and treatment research.",,,,,"Sheth, Amit/ABC-4600-2020","Sheth, Amit/0000-0002-0021-5293; Banerjee, Tanvi/0000-0002-9794-3755; Romine, William/0000-0002-0386-1688",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,APR-JUN,2019,5,2,,,,,78,96,e11036,10.2196/11036,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/11036,,,,,,,,31165711,,,,,WOS:000526816400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating vaccine-related information, it is important to analyze the trend of information available on Facebook. Methods: We searched Facebook on August 15, 2018 to obtain posts containing relevant health information on influenza vaccine in years 2015-2018. We collected information regarding nature of the post (eg, pro-, antivaccine, and informational), number of shares and likes received, and ease of reading for each post. We evaluated these characteristics by year and type of post in our exploratory analyses. Results: The proportion of pro-vaccine posts has increased compared to antivaccine and informational posts since 2016. There was no correlation between ease of reading and popularity of posts. Although the language of antivaccine posts was complex, they were shared and liked more than pro-vaccine posts. The pro-vaccine personal post by a nurse was the most popular in our study (shared over 46,000 times) in 2018. Conclusions: Though the number of pro-vaccine posts increased, antivaccine posts remained more popular.

Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 %; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 %, while with random movement restriction it was 13 %. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 % overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.",,,,,"Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017; Dietze, Klaas/JJF-6743-2023; Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094; Dietze, Klaas/0000-0002-6138-6707; Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353; Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-5877,1873-1716,,,,2022 AUG,2022,205,,,,,,,,105683,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35689992,,,,,WOS:000833401100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to empirically evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of paid ads for recruitment into a national trial testing an Internet-based, coached intervention for parents of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. Methods: Post hoc analysis of FB ad data and Google analytics on the online trial consent site (myStudies) were conducted on 11 campaigns employing static image/text ads. Standard metrics (e.g., click through rate, cost per 1000 impressions, cost per consent) were calculated and descriptive statistics comparing FB ad engagement and enrolled participants over time were conducted. Results: Ad campaigns were active for a combined 115 days over 58 weeks resulting in 1533 links to the online recruitment site. During the ad campaigns, the mean rate of enrolment was 1 participant every 2 days. The first 3 ad campaigns were the most cost-effective. Mean cost per enrolment was $19.27 (Canadian dollars). Conclusions: FB ads were efficient and cost-effective in broad dissemination of trial information, but more research is needed to explore the impact of saturation (how often ads are posted), design (what is in the ad), and individual determinants (who is likely to respond to an ad) on converting FB ad engagement into enrolment.

We will evaluate observational studies (eg, cohort and case-control) conducted using routinely collected health data for investigating the associations between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease). The following electronic databases will be searched (from their inception onwards): MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. Screening and selection of articles will be conducted by at least two researchers. Potential discrepancies will be resolved via discussion. Design, methods and reporting characteristics in each article will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form. Information on general, methodological and transparency items will be reported. We will summarise our findings with tables and graphs (eg, bar charts, forest plots). Ethics and dissemination Due to the nature of the proposed study, no ethical approval will be required. We plan to publish the full study in an open access peer-reviewed journal and disseminate the findings at scientific conferences and via social media. All data will be deposited in a cross-disciplinary public repository.",,,,,"Sander, Chris/H-1452-2011; Catalá-López, Ferrán/N-6018-2018; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo/K-8182-2013; valencia, alfonso/I-3127-2015","Sander, Chris/0000-0001-6059-6270; Catalá-López, Ferrán/0000-0002-3833-9312; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo/0000-0002-5084-2818; bernal, enrique/0009-0001-1753-9104; Hutton, Brian/0000-0001-5662-8647; Page, Matthew/0000-0002-4242-7526; valencia, alfonso/0000-0002-8937-6789; Bernal-Delgado, Enrique/0000-0002-0961-3298",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,APR,2022,12,4,,,,,,,e058738,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058738,,,,,,,,35487732,,,,,WOS:000789930900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is an approximate 6-month reporting lag for provisional counts of drug overdose deaths from the National Vital Statistics System, and the highest level of geospatial resolution is at the state level. By contrast, public social media data are available close to real-time and are often accessible with precise coordinates.Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess whether county-level overdose mortality burden could be estimated using opioid-related Twitter data.Methods: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for poisoning or exposure to overdose at the county level were obtained from CDC WONDER. Demographics were collected from the American Community Survey. The Twitter Application Programming Interface was used to obtain tweets that contained any of the 36 terms with drug names. An unsupervised classification approach was used for clustering tweets. Population-normalized variables and polynomial population-normalized variables were produced. Furthermore, z scores of the Getis Ord Gi clustering statistic were produced, and both these scores and their polynomial counterparts were explored in regression modeling of county-level overdose mortality burden. A series of linear regression models were used for predictive modeling to explore the interpretability of the analytical output.Results: Modeling overdose mortality with normalized demographic variables alone explained only 7.4% of the variability in county-level overdose mortality, whereas this was approximately doubled by the use of specific demographic and Twitter data covariates based on a backward selection approach. The highest adjusted R2 and lowest AIC (Akaike Info Criterion) were obtained for the model with normalized demographic variables, normalized z scores from geospatial analyses, and normalized topic counts (adjusted R2=0.133, AIC=8546.8). The z scores of the Getis Ord Gi statistic appeared to have improved utility over population-normalization alone. In this model, median age, female population, and tweets about web-based drug sales were positively associated with opioid mortality. Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity were significantly negatively associated with county-level burdens of overdose mortality.Conclusions: Social media data, when transformed using certain statistical approaches, may add utility to the goal of producing closer to real-time county-level estimates of overdose mortality. Prediction of opioid-related outcomes can be advanced to inform prevention and treatment decisions. This interdisciplinary approach can facilitate evidence-based funding decisions for various substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs.",,,,,"Mackey, Tim/H-9156-2013","Mackey, Tim/0000-0002-2191-7833; McMann, Tiana/0000-0003-1964-5549; Li, Zhuoran/0000-0001-6192-4301; Calac, Alec/0000-0003-1348-9717",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,,2023,7,,,,,,,,e42162,10.2196/42162,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/42162,,,,,,,,36548118,,,,,WOS:000998428700029,View Full Record in Web of Science

TikTok is a medium primarily used by adolescents and young adults under 30 years. TikTok is thus an appropriate social media platform with which to examine discussions of anxiety among this age cohort. In this exploratory mixed-methods study we aimed to evaluate the scope of anxiety content available on TikTok in English in December 2021, and to further develop methods for analysing TikTok content. Methods We analysed a data set of 147 TikToks with the hashtag #anxiety. The data set consisted both of metadata and TikTok videos. This data set represented 18% of all TikToks featuring the hashtag #anxiety in December 2021. We examined the following research questions (RQs). RQ1: What are the creator identities reflected in the final data set in this study?; RQ2: What are the metadata characteristics of the TikToks in the final data set?; RQ3: What are the anxiety content themes in the final data set?; and RQ4: What are the characteristics of the data set based on an anxiety management reference checklist? This study involves public data that can reasonably be observed by strangers. This study does not include any identifiable human participants.Results Influencers were the most frequent creator identity in our data set. Influencers comprised 85.5% of the 147 TikToks in our final data set. We coded 79 female (54%) and 45 male (31%) influencers. We found male influencers created the most played (mean 8,114,706), and most liked (mean 1,510,585) TikToks. We found content themes varied by influencer gender. The notable findings were (a) the greater use of humour by males (22.7% males; n=10, and females 12.6%; n=10); and (b) inspiration (38.7%; males n=17; and 13.9%; females n=11). Among female influencers, we identified self-disclosure as the most common theme (n= 40 and 50.7% compared with n=11 and 25% male influencers). Overall, we found limited references to evidence -based anxiety self-care content in our final data set.Discussion We suggest that the TikToks in our data set were primarily directed at raising awareness of and de -stigmatising anxiety symptoms. TikTok anxiety content may be viewed by adolescents for emotional self -regulation beyond evidence-based health information seeking. Self-disclosure on TikTok may also provide symptomatic relief to adolescents with anxiety. We suggest that gender is a salient consideration when considering TikTok content. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with existing literature on adolescent social media use and epidemiological data on anxiety. This research also provides methodological insights for researchers and clinicians seeking to understand TikTok, and to develop engaging content targeted at the specific concerns and preferences of adolescent TikTok consumers.",,,,,"Anderson, Judith/E-5738-2017","Anderson, Judith/0000-0002-8310-0458; Dineen-Griffin, Sarah/0000-0001-7080-0108",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,DEC 14,2022,14,12,,,,,,,,10.7759/cureus.32530,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.32530,,,,,,,,36654625,,,,,WOS:000904947300025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network analysis (SNA). Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research. For SNA results, the position status of each component is described by the center value.

The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases. Objective: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease-travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. Methods: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. Results: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information. Conclusions: Our findings have implications for informing the ways in which public health organizations communicate with the public on social media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAY 13,2019,21,5,,,,,,,e13090,10.2196/13090,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/13090,,,,,,,,31094347,,,,,WOS:000468100500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results: The prevalence of PIUgen among adolescents in Central Siberia was 7.2%; the prevalence of PUgame was 10.4%; the prevalence of PUsocial was 8.0%. The results of structural equation modelling, as well as the correlation analysis data, suggest two possible patterns of psychosocial problems with PIU-the first one is characteristic of both PIUgen and PUsocial.

Multiple linear regression analyses esti-mated the association between sexual orientation and recreational screen time, as well as problematic use of video games, social media, and mobile phones.Results: In a sample of 10,339 adolescents (48.7% female, 46.0% racial/ethnic minority), sexual minority (compared to heterosexual) identification was associated with 3.72 (95% CI 2.96-4.47) more hours of daily recreational screen time, specifically more time on television, YouTube videos, video games, texting, social media, video chat, and browsing the internet. Possible sexual minority identification (responding maybe to the sexual minority question) was associated with 1.58 (95% CI 0.92-2.24) more hours of screen time compared to heterosexual identification. Sexual minority and possible sexual minority identification were associated with higher problematic social media, video games, and mobile phone use. Conclusions: Sexual minority adolescents spend a disproportionate amount of time engaging in screen-based activities, which can lead to problematic screen use.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Stigma is pervasive in social media and can contribute to poorer health outcomes. We examine how stigma and negative feelings concerning NAFLD/NASH and obesity manifest on Twitter. Methods Using a self-developed search terms index, we collected NAFLD/NASH tweets from May to October 2019 (Phase I). Because stigmatizing NAFLD/NASH tweets were limited, Phase II focused on obesity (November-December 2019). Via sentiment analysis, >5000 tweets were annotated as positive, neutral or negative and used to train machine learning-based Natural Language Processing software, applied to 193 747 randomly sampled tweets. All tweets collected were analysed. Results In Phase I, 16 835 tweets for NAFLD and 2376 for NASH were retrieved. Of the annotated NAFLD/NASH tweets, 97/1130 (8.6%) and 63/535 (11.8%), respectively, related to obesity and 13/1130 (1.2%) and 5/535 (0.9%), to stigma; they primarily focused on scientific discourse and unverified information. Of the 193 747 non-annotated obesity tweets (Phase II), the algorithm classified 40.0% as related to obesity, of which 85.2% were negative, 1.0% positive and 13.7% neutral. Conclusions NAFLD/NASH tweets mostly indicated an unmet information need and showed no clear signs of stigma. However, the negative content of obesity tweets was recurrent.

Purpose: The aim was to determine the 100 most mentioned articles on the internet in the field of glaucoma and analyze their characteristics. Materials and Methods: We identified the top 100 glaucoma articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), an automatically calculated metric for monitoring social media. Each article was evaluated for several characteristics including year of publication, title, journal name, journal impact factor (IF), article topic, article type, affiliation, and online mentions (news, blog, policy, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). Correlation analysis was conducted for AAS with these characteristics. Results: The selected 100 articles came from 44 journals with more than half (56%) published in ophthalmology-specific journals. There was no significant correlation between IF and number of articles in a specific journal or AAS (P > 0.1), but the number of articles in the top 100 was higher for ophthalmology journals with a higher IF (P < 0.05). Original study was the most common study type (87%), of which clinical observation study was the most common subgroup (40%). Epidemiology/risk factor and basic science were the most common article topics (each 24%), followed by medical treatment (13%). Article topics regarding medical treatment had a significantly greater AAS than other topics (P < 0.05). Of the top 5 articles, more than half (60%) were related to Lifestyle choice topics. Conclusions: There was no association between journal IF and AAS, consistent with previous studies. 90% of journals that had articles in the top 100 had a Twitter page.

We aimed to conduct a cross-sectional, international, crowdsourcing, artificial-intelligence (AI) web-based study of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) self-reporting their outcomes. MethodsA proprietary STW Bayesian inference model was built to measure improvement in CD severity (on scale of 1-5) for each treatment and ranked treatments using effectiveness. The effectiveness of first-line biological treatments was analyzed by multiple comparisons and by calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each treatment pair. ResultsWe included 7593 self-reported CD patients for the analysis. Most of the participants were female (75.8%) and from English-speaking countries (95.7%). Overall, anti-TNF drugs were the most reported tried treatment (52.8%). Infliximab (IFX) was ranked as the most effective treatment by the STW effectiveness model followed by bowel surgery (second), adalimumab (ADA, third), ustekinumab (UST, 4rd), and vedolizumab (VDZ, fifth). In paired comparison analyses, IFX was most effective, ADA had similar effectiveness compared to UST and all three were more effective than VDZ. ConclusionWe present the first online crowdsourcing AI platform-based study of self-reported treatment effectiveness in CD. Net-based crowdsourcing patient-reported outcome platforms can potentially help both clinicians and patients select the best treatment for their condition.",,,,,,"Engel, Tal/0000-0002-4215-9832; Fay, Shmuel/0009-0001-1586-6056",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-6406,2050-6414,,,,2023 SEP,2023,11,7,,,,,621,632,,10.1002/ueg2.12424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12424,,JUN 2023,,,,,,37370250,,,,,WOS:001020256400001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Liu, S; Chen, B; Kuo, A",,,,"Liu, Sam; Chen, Brian; Kuo, Alex",,,Monitoring Physical Activity Levels Using Twitter Data: Infodemiology Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Social media technology such as Twitter allows users to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions online. The growing body of social media data is becoming a central part of infodemiology research as these data can be combined with other public health datasets (eg, physical activity levels) to provide real-time monitoring of psychological and behavior outcomes that inform health behaviors. Currently, it is unclear whether Twitter data can be used to monitor physical activity levels. Objective: The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of using Twitter data to monitor physical activity levels by assessing whether the frequency and sentiment of physical activity-related tweets were associated with physical activity levels across the United States. Methods: Tweets were collected from Twitter's application programming interface (API) between January 10, 2017 and January 2, 2018. We used Twitter's garden hose method of collecting tweets, which provided a random sample of approximately 1% of all tweets with location metadata falling within the United States. Geotagged tweets were filtered. A list of physical activity-related hashtags was collected and used to further classify these geolocated tweets. Twitter data were merged with physical activity data collected as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Multiple linear regression models were fit to assess the relationship between physical activity-related tweets and physical activity levels by county while controlling for population and socioeconomic status measures. Results: During the study period, 442,959,789 unique tweets were collected, of which 64,005,336 (14.44%) were geotagged with latitude and longitude coordinates. Aggregated data were obtained for a total of 3138 counties in the United States. The mean county-level percentage of physically active individuals was 74.05% (SD 5.2) and 75.30% (SD 4.96) after adjusting for age. The model showed that the percentage of physical activity-related tweets was significantly associated with physical activity levels (beta=.11; SE 0.2; P<.001) and age-adjusted physical activity (beta=.10; SE 0.20; P<.001) on a county level while adjusting for both Gini index and education level. However, the overall explained variance of the model was low (R-2 =.11). The sentiment of the physical activity-related tweets was not a significant predictor of physical activity level and age-adjusted physical activity on a county level after including the Gini index and education level in the model (P>.05). Conclusions: Social media data may be a valuable tool for public health organizations to monitor physical activity levels, as it can overcome the time lag in the reporting of physical activity epidemiology data faced by traditional research methods (eg, surveys and observational studies). Consequently, this tool may have the potential to help public health organizations better mobilize and target physical activity interventions.",,,,,"Liu, Sam/IUP-7806-2023; Chen, Ziqi/AAN-7645-2020","Chen, Ziqi/0000-0001-7655-6986; Leo, TJ/0000-0002-9525-6572",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUN 3,2019,21,6,,,,,,,e12394,10.2196/12394,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/12394,,,,,,,,31162126,,,,,WOS:000470667200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is an absence of longitudinal studies that distinguish between time-varying factors, accounting for parallel developmental changes and common underlying vulnerability. Design A total of 3,801 adolescents were administered self-report measures, annually, over the course of 5 years. The association of screen time (social media use, television watching, video gaming) on eating related symptoms was analyzed using a longitudinal Bayesian multilevel path analysis framework. Self-esteem was examined as a mediating factor in this model. This study investigated direct and indirect associations at between-person, concurrent within-person, and lagged-within-person levels, while controlling for gender. Results The findings revealed that all types of screen time exposure were significantly associated with eating related symptoms at between and within-person levels. A significant association at the lagged-within person level was only revealed for social media use. Self-esteem was found to be a significant mediating factor between screen time and eating related symptoms. Conclusion An increase in social media use one year was associated with increased of eating related symptoms two years later through lower self-esteem.

J,"Tempini, N; Del Savio, L",,,,"Tempini, Niccolo; Del Savio, Lorenzo",,,Digital orphans: Data closure and openness in patient-powered networks,BIOSOCIETIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we discuss an issue linked to data-sharing regimes in patient-powered, social-media-based networks, namely that most of the data that patient users share are not used to research scientific issues or the patient voice. This is not a trivial issue, as participation in these networks is linked to openness in data sharing, which would benefit fellow patients and contributes to the public good more generally. Patient-powered research networks are often framed as disrupting research agendas and the industry. However, when data that patients share are not accessible for research, their epistemic potential is denied. The problem is linked to the business models of the organisations managing these networks: models centred on controlling patient data tend to close networks with regard to data use. The constraint on research is at odds with the ideals of a sharing, open and supportive epistemic community that networks' own narratives evoke. This kind of failure can create peculiar scenarios, such as the emergence of the 'digital orphans' of Internet research. By pointing out the issue of data use, this paper informs the discussion about the capacity of patient-powered networks to support research participation and the patient voice.",,,,,"Tempini, Niccolò/G-6809-2013","Tempini, Niccolò/0000-0002-5100-5376",,,,,,,,,,,,,1745-8552,1745-8560,,,,JUN,2019,14,2,,,,,205,227,,10.1057/s41292-018-0125-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41292-018-0125-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469913700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Known to have more than two billion users of all ages, YT also serves as an important educational tool and information source for patients and their families. YT videos have the potential to influence patients' understanding of their di-agnoses and treatment decision-making.Methods: Videos were identified using the keywords multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis treatment, re-lapsing remitting MS, and central demyelinating disorder in the YT search bar. For each search term, the top 30 videos were reviewed. The videos were analyzed by two independent raters using the DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems. Qualitative and quantitative data were recorded for each video.Results: A total of 99 videos were analyzed. The mean DISCERN score was 43.44 out of 75 possible points, and the mean Global Quality Scale (GQS) score was 2.77 out of 5 possible points. Of all the videos, 14.1, 29.3, 15.2, and 29.3% were categorized as very poor, poor, moderate, good, and excellent, respectively. Videos that included qualitative features such as clear information; information related to symptomatology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, treatment response, and epidemiology; and diagrams and radiological images had significantly higher scale scores. Audience engagement parameters were significantly higher for videos containing animation, treatment response, and radiological images.Conclusion: We maintain that sufficient, reliable, and useful content is not provided for those seeking information on YT about MS.

The prevalence of IBS is estimated to be 11.2% worldwide and even though it is not a life-threatening condition, it affects the quality of life and results in an economic burden on the healthcare system. According to the Rome III criteria, IBS is described as abdominal pain that improves with defecation and the onset of the pain is associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency that cannot be explained by any biochemical or structural abnormality. Aim: To document the epidemiology of IBS and its associated risk factors in the central region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in the central region of Saudi Arabia, carried out by distributing an online self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed online in social media and websites. The sample size was 426 participants with a precision of +/- 5% and 95% confidence interval (CI). The questionnaire included demographic characters such as age, gender, occupation, and marital status. The questionnaire also included body mass index (BMI), smoking, family history of IBS, Rome III criteria for diagnosing IBS, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 426 (230 [54%] male and 196 [46%] female) participants were enrolled in the study. According to Rome III criteria, 130 had IBS and the prevalence was 30.5%. Univariate analysis showed that gender, anxiety, depression, and low physical activity are statistically significant variables with symptomatic IBS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, a high prevalence of IBS in the Central Saudi Arabia population was observed along with the presence of some modifiable risk factors, yet, the sample size was small which shows the need for more studies in this area particularly on the general population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1119-3077,,,,,OCT,2020,23,10,,,,,1414,1418,,10.4103/njcp.njcp_382_19,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/njcp.njcp_382_19,,,,,,,,33047699,,,,,WOS:000617098200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

When the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of medical schools in these countries in March-April 2020, the medical students were repatriated to Bhutan. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and their attitude towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. The survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Knowledge was considered good if the cumulative score was >= 80%, satisfactory if >= 60-79% and poor if <60%. Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response was tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to the survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilation and on home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with the duration of clinical clerkship they had undertaken (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play.

Promises and concerns from Twitter discussions in Denmark,DIGITAL HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Digital health data are seen as valuable resources for the development of better and more efficient treatments, for instance through personalised medicine. However, health data are information about individuals who hold opinions and can challenge how data about them are used. Therefore it is important to understand public discussions around reuse of digital health data. Social media have been heralded as enabling new forms of public engagement and as a place to study social issues. In this paper, we study a public debate on Twitter about personalised medicine. We explore who participates in discussions about personalised medicine on Twitter and what they tweet about. Based on user-generated biographies we categorise users as having a 'Professional interest in personalised medicine' or as 'Private' users. We describe how users within the field tweet about the promises of personalised medicine, while users unaffiliated with the field tweet about the concrete realisation of these ambitions in the form of a new infrastructure and express concerns about the conditions for the implementation. Our study serves to remind people interested in public opinion that Twitter is a platform used for multiple purposes by different actors and not simply a bottom-up democratic forum.

These data can provide timely illustrations of how individuals discuss miscarriages and preterm births, as well as insights into the wellbeing of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Here we aim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and describe the perceived emotional state of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Methods We obtained 291 443 Twitter postings on miscarriages and preterm births from January 2017 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to identify major topics of discussion. We applied time series decomposition methods to assess temporal trends and identify major drivers of discussion. Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional content of 7282 personal miscarriage disclosure tweets into the following non-mutually exclusive categories: grief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation, annoyance, and neutral. Results Topics in our data fell into eight groups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure, politics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu vaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political discussions around miscarriages were largely due to a misunderstanding between abortions and miscarriages. Grief and annoyance were the most commonly expressed emotions within the miscarriage self-disclosures; 50.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.1, 52.2) and 16.2% (95% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings increased with celebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of prescribed medications and outrage over the high rate of preterm births in the United States. Miscarriage disclosures by celebrities also led to disclosures by women who had similar experiences. Conclusions This study suggests that increase in discussions of miscarriage on social media are associated with several factors, including celebrity disclosures.

However, relevant researches about how COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the epidemiological trend of STDs are limited in China. This study aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on STDs in China and proposed relevant recommendations to be used in bettering health. Methods The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in China from 2008 to 2020 were collected. Grey Model (1,1) were established to predict the incidence of STDs with the incidence data of these three STDs from 2013 to 2018 considering the impact of policies in China, respectively. We then calculated the predictive incidence of each STD in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by the established Model. And we estimated the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiological changes of STDs by analyzing the difference between the absolute percentage error (APE) of the predictive incidence and actual rate in 2019 and 2020. Results The incidence of HIV infection and syphilis showed a trend of increase from 2008 to 2019 in China, but that for gonorrhea was fluctuant. Of note, the incidence of these three STDs decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The APE of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in 2020 (20.54%, 15.45% and 60.88%) were about 7 times, 4 times and 2 times of that in 2019 (2.94%, 4.07% and 30.41%). The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea would be 5.77/100,000, 39.64/100,000 and 13.19/100,000 in 2021 based on our model. Conclusions The epidemiological trend of STDs in China was significant influenced by COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to balance the control of COVID-19 and timely management of STDs during the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent or reduce the poor outcome among COVID-19 patients with STDs.

Data were collected between October 2018 and March 2020. 58.1 % (n = 473) responded to the English survey, 34.3 % (n = 279) responded to the French survey, and 7.6 % (n = 62) responded to the Norwegian survey. The questionnaire contained 38 questions divided into seven themes: Background and health goals, Wearables and sensors, Mobile applications, Logging of health data, Data sharing-and integration, Social media and entertainment, and Demographics (age, gender, country of origin, chronic disease status, and chronic disease caretaker status). Answer options were single answer, multiple-choice, open-ended, or on a 4-point Likert scale. Questions were defined based on 16 in-person interviews with people without any chronic disorder, people with diabetes, and people with sickle cell disease. All questions were optional. Data were collected from 814 participants. All answers to the open-ended questions have been translated into English. This dataset is especially interesting for researchers interesting in what motivates people with and without chronic dis-ease across countries to use mHealth tools and share their collected health data. Only a subset of variables has been analyzed so far and new research questions on motivation can potentially be answered using this dataset.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Numerous articles related to ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100 most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations. Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100 most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded. Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation coefficients (CC). Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were research support by institutes (56%) and epidemiology (28%). The most productive countries were the United States (42%), followed by the United Kingdom (13%), Germany (9%), and the Netherlands (9%). Most articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (15%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9%). MeSH terms were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were excluded because they do not have MeSH terms). Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top 100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and other academic disciplines.",,,,,"smile, chien/AAA-1053-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-859X,,,,JAN 21,2021,20,1,,,,,,,6,10.1186/s12991-021-00329-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00329-3,,,,,,,,33478559,,,,,WOS:000609471900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By analyzing over 38,000 geotagged tweets of 93 active Twitter users in three U.S. cities, the two-dimensional Gaussian masking technique with proper standard deviation settings is found to be more effective to protect user's location privacy while sacrificing geospatial analytical resolution than the random perturbation masking method and the aggregation on traffic analysis zones. Furthermore, a three-dimensional theoretical framework considering privacy, analytics, and uncertainty factors simultaneously is proposed to assess geomasking techniques.

However, limited research has been conducted on the relationship between social media and suicide. Little is known about individuals' vulnerable to suicide, especially when social media suicide information is extremely prevalent.Objective: This study aims to identify the characteristics underlying individuals' vulnerability to suicide brought about by an increase in suicide-related tweets, thereby contributing to public health. Methods: A case-only design was used to investigate vulnerability to suicide using individual data of people who died by suicide and tweet data from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Japanese government statistics, and tweet data were provided by a commercial service. Tweet data identified the days when suicide-related tweets surged, and the date-keyed merging was performed by considering 3 and 7 lag days. For the merged data set for analysis, the logistic regression model was fitted with one of the personal characteristics of interest as a dependent variable and the dichotomous exposure variable. This analysis was performed to estimate the interaction between the surges in suicide-related tweets and personal characteristics of the suicide victims as case-only odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. For the sensitivity analysis, unexpected deaths other than suicide were considered.Results: During the study period, there were 159,490 suicides and 115,072 unexpected deaths, and the number of suicide-related tweets was 2,804,999. Following the 3-day lag of a highly tweeted day, there were significant interactions for those who were aged 40 years or younger (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15), male (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18), divorced (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 1.19), unemployed (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22), and living in urban areas (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.17 1.35). By contrast, widowed individuals had significantly lower interactions (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89). Except for unemployment, significant relationships were also observed for the 7-day lag. For the sensitivity analysis, no significant interactions were observed for other unexpected deaths in the 3-day lag, and only the widowed had a significantly larger interaction than those who were married (OR 1.08, 95%Conclusions: This study revealed the interactions of personal characteristics associated with susceptibility to suicide-related tweets. In addition, a few significant relationships were observed in the sensitivity analysis, suggesting that such an interaction is specific to suicide deaths. In other words, individuals with these characteristics, such as being young, male, unemployed, and divorced, may be vulnerable to surges in suicide-related tweets. Thus, minimizing public health strain by identifying people who are vulnerable and susceptible to a surge in suicide-related information on the internet is necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,,2023,7,,,,,,,,e47798,10.2196/47798,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/47798,,,,,,,,37561553,,,,,WOS:001051770000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study presents innovative field strategies adopted by the Sangrur population-based cancer registry for residence confirmation and updating follow-up status of cancer cases. Methods: A network was developed with the involvement of local community members to validate the address and follow-up status of cancer cases. In addition, social media was used to trace patients who were loss to followup.Results: The Sangrur population-based cancer registry was unable to trace a total of 31 cancer cases. After implementing innovative field methods, 26 (83.9%) cases were successfully traced back; while 5 (16.1%) cases were untraced despite several efforts. A majority of these 31 cases were from urban areas (93.5%) compared to rural (6.5%). True Caller with the help of WhatsApp contributed significantly by tracing 9 cases (34.6%); followed by 4 cases (15.4%) traced with the help of a postman, 3 cases each (11.5%) with the electoral list and gas agency personnel, and 2 cases (7.7%) through medical shops. Also, 2 cases (7.7%) were traced with the help of treating hospital while Facebook and property tax office traced 1 case (3.8%) each.Conclusion: By engaging with the local community, and with the use of social media, the patient's residence and follow-up status can be updated.

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions. Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. Results: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media.

This study analyzed the magnitude and sentiment dynamics of misinformation and unverified information about public health interventions during a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang, Vietnam, between July and September 2020. Methods: We analyzed user-generated online information about five public health interventions during the Da Nang outbreak. We compared the volume, source, sentiment polarity, and engagements of online posts before, during, and after the outbreak using negative binomial and logistic regression, and assessed the content validity of the 500 most influential posts. Results: Most of the 54,528 online posts included were generated during the outbreak (n = 46,035; 84.42%) and by online newspapers (n = 32,034; 58.75%). Among the 500 most influential posts, 316 (63.20%) contained genuine information, 10 (2.00%) contained misinformation, 152 (30.40%) were non-factual opinions, and 22 (4.40%) contained unverifiable information. All misinformation posts were made during the outbreak, mostly on social media, and were predominantly negative.

No longer figured (merely) as passive recipients of healthcare services or as beneficiaries of top-down biomedical information, individuals are increasingly seen as active contributors in healthcare and research. They are positioned into multiple roles that are experienced simultaneously by those who access and co-produce digital content that can easily be transformed into data. This is contextualised by 'big data' technologies that have altered biomedicine, enabling collation and analysis of myriad data from digitised records to personal mobile data. Social media facilitate new formations of communities and knowledge enacted online, while novel kinds of commercial value emerge from digital networks that enable health data commodification. In this paper, we draw from exemplary digital era shifts towards participatory medicine to cast light on the rapprochements between patienthood, participation and consumption, and we explore how these rapprochements are mediated by, and materialise through, the use of participatory digital technologies and big data. We argue that there is a need to use new conceptual tools that account for the multiple roles and experiences of patient-participant-consumers that co-emerge through digital technologies.

However, 2 challenges arise when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes. Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between 2000 and 2020 using the keyword Medicine [Journal]. Author names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their research themes. Results: Our findings revealed the following: within the top 10 cited authors, 2 authors from China shared identical names with Jing Li and Tao-Wang; JA Winkelstein from Maryland (US) had the highest x-index (15.58); Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan was the most prolific author, having published 115 articles in Medicine since 2003; and the 3 primary research themes, namely, complications, etiology, and epidemiology, were identified using MeSH terms from the 10 most frequently cited authors.

Previous studies have investigated the quality of online burn education videos on platforms such as YouTube. Here, we review the quality of such videos on TikTok, a newer and rapidly growing platform. TikTok was searched for English videos using 29 keywords (hashtags) such as #burn, #education, #prevention, and #management. The first 30 videos per hashtag were screened. Videos were categorized by content and creator. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the included videos using the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Metrics such as views, commentary, and likes were also examined. Of 535 screened videos, 72 met inclusion criteria. 47% (n = 34) were on management, 33% (n = 31) education, and 10% (n = 7) prevention. Only 6% (n = 4) cited sources. The median GQS score was 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0). 50% (n = 36) were made by healthcare professionals with a median GQS score of 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0) compared to 2.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0) in nonhealthcare professionals (n = 36).

At the same time, just as public health data and theory has shown that aspects of the built environment can affect our health-related behaviors and outcomes, it is also possible that online social environments (e.g., posts and other attributes of our online social networks) can also shape facets of our life. Given the important role of the online environment in public health research and implications, factors which contribute to the generation of such data must be well understood. Here we study the role of the built and online social environments in the expression of dining on Instagram in Abu Dhabi; a ubiquitous social media platform, city with a vibrant dining culture, and a topic (food posts) which has been studied in relation to public health outcomes. Our study uses available data on user Instagram profiles and their Instagram networks, as well as the local food environment measured through the dining types (e.g., casual dining restaurants, food court restaurants, lounges etc.) by neighborhood. We find evidence that factors of the online social environment (profiles that post about dining versus profiles that do not post about dining) have different influences on the relationship between a user's built environment and the social dining expression, with effects also varying by dining types in the environment and time of day. We examine the mechanism of the relationships via moderation and mediation analyses. Overall, this study provides evidence that the interplay of online and built environments depend on attributes of said environments and can also vary by time of day. We discuss implications of this synergy for precisely-targeting public health interventions, as well as on using online data for public health research.",,,,,,"Chunara, Rumi/0000-0002-5346-7259",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,FEB 1,2020,17,3,,,,,,,735,10.3390/ijerph17030735,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030735,,,,,,,,31979291,,,,,WOS:000517783300060,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in Iran as one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Data were collected from the contents published from February 19 to April 3, 2020, on Instagram. The search feature of the Instagram app was used to find the posts related to Coronavirus or COVID-19. Overall, 1612 posts from 92 accounts were retrieved and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: A total of 23 themes emerged from the analysis of the retrieved posts. These themes include epidemiology and statistics, training and caring, general prevention guidelines, hygiene, healthy diet and lifestyle, patients, diagnosis and treatment, personal protective equipment, traditional medicine, psychol-ogy, children, cultural aspects, socio-cultural impacts, religious, misinformation, and wrong behaviors, an-imals, satire, condition of the healthcare system, politics, quarantine, operations of the Iranian National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO), economic impacts, and world news. Conclusion: The contents analysis of Instagram posts during a public health crisis can provide new and realistic insights into the crisis and identify the topics of interest or concern of the public.

D.; Makau, Dennis N.; Corzo, Cesar A.",,,Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity. Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways, though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p < 0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon heterogeneities in network connectivity.",,,,,"Makau, Dennis/I-2883-2019; Paploski, Igor AD/D-7015-2014","Makau, Dennis/0000-0002-1802-2545; Paploski, Igor AD/0000-0002-3689-2042; VanderWaal, Kimberly/0000-0002-5764-6430",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-5877,1873-1716,,,,MAY,2020,178,,,,,,,,104977,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104977,,,,,,,,32279002,,,,,WOS:000533510200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies to date have focused on understanding the progression of single chronic disease rather than multiple chronic diseases. In this study, a research framework is proposed using social network analysis and graph theory using administrative healthcare data to understand the comorbidity of two chronic diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) leading to the development of cardiovascular disease). The results show that diseases related to blood (e.g., high blood pressure or high cholesterol) and kidney disease occurred frequently during the progression of cardiovascular disease for the T2D patients.

Several effective medications for OUD (MOUD) exist and have been shown to be life-saving. A large volume of research has identified a confluence of factors that predict attrition and continued substance use during substance use disorder treatment. However, much of this literature has examined a small set of potential moderators or mediators of outcomes in MOUD treatment and may lead to over-simplified accounts of treatment non-adherence. Digital health methodologies offer great promise for capturing intensive, longitudinal ecologically-valid data from individuals in MOUD treatment to extend our understanding of factors that impact treatment engagement and outcomes. Methods: This paper describes the protocol (including the study design and methodological considerations) from a novel study supported by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This study (D-TECT) primarily seeks to evaluate the feasibility of collecting ecological momentary assessment (EMA), smartphone and smartwatch sensor data, and social media data among patients in outpatient MOUD treatment. It secondarily seeks to examine the utility of EMA, digital sensing, and social media data (separately and compared to one another) in predicting MOUD treatment retention, opioid use events, and medication adherence [as captured in electronic health records (EHR) and EMA data]. To our knowledge, this is the first project to include all three sources of digitally derived data (EMA, digital sensing, and social media) in understanding the clinical trajectories of patients in MOUD treatment. These multiple data streams will allow us to understand the relative and combined utility of collecting digital data from these diverse data sources. The inclusion of EHR data allows us to focus on the utility of digital health data in predicting objectively measured clinical outcomes. Discussion: Results may be useful in elucidating novel relations between digital data sources and OUD treatment outcomes. It may also inform approaches to enhancing outcomes measurement in clinical trials by allowing for the assessment of dynamic interactions between individuals' daily lives and their MOUD treatment response.",,,,,"Jacobson, Nicholas C./J-4543-2019","Jacobson, Nicholas C./0000-0002-8832-4741; Mishra, Varun/0000-0003-3891-5460",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-0640,,,,,APR 29,2022,13,,,,,,,,871916,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.871916,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.871916,,,,,,,,35573377,,,,,WOS:000836299400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.",,,,,"Sheikh, Aziz/D-2818-2009; Hussain, Amir/AAG-6299-2020; Dashtipour, Kia/AAX-9489-2020","Sheikh, Aziz/0000-0001-7022-3056; Hussain, Amir/0000-0002-8080-082X; Dashtipour, Kia/0000-0002-9651-6487; Gogate, Mandar/0000-0003-1712-9014; Sheikh, Zakariya/0000-0003-4147-4205; Tahir, Ahsen/0000-0001-8247-9390; Hussain, Zain/0000-0002-0559-8289; Ali, Azhar/0000-0002-4840-5483",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,APR 5,2021,23,4,,,,,,,e26627,10.2196/26627,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26627,,,,,,,,33724919,,,,,WOS:000636811100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.",,,,,"Moni, Mohammad Ali/ABG-3606-2020; Uddin, Shahadat/E-1963-2011","Uddin, Shahadat/0000-0003-0091-6919; Moni, Mohammad Ali/0000-0003-0756-1006; Hossain, Md Ekramul/0000-0001-6913-8313; Khan, Arif/0000-0002-5793-933X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,JAN 2,2020,17,2,,,,,,,596,10.3390/ijerph17020596,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17020596,,,,,,,,31963383,,,,,WOS:000516827400217,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A cross sectional online survey based on the largest social media in China. Online questionnaire was pushed twice a day to our target respondents for successive seven days. We were authorized to gain, analyze and publish the information related to this research by the Sina & Weibo data center. Results: Prevalence of pediatric scalds was 5.5%. Gender ratio (boy to girl) was 1.96: 1. Toddlers (12-36 months old) were the most susceptible age group (54.5%). Non-intentional water spill was the main causation (77.3%). An extremely low percent (7.1%) of the parents performed first-aid as described by the RRICH rule: water rinse-clothes remove-water immersion-clean cover-hospital. Scars developed in 52.7% patients and 14.7% of them underwent reconstructive surgery. There were 75.5% Chinese families using vacuum flasks in daily life, but only 6.1% families used the fastening device to avoid burns.

Yet, this recent surge brings new and uncertain challenges for injury epidemiology. Since many in the population are of child-bearing age, and child agricultural injury is a significant threat, of particular relevance are the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs towards risk of child injury. Methods: A paper, self-administered 11-question questionnaire was distributed at four events geared towards early career women organic farmers. The questionnaire generated data around select demographics, attitudes towards farm safety, and sources of safety knowledge. Findings & Discussion: The questionnaire had a 45% response rate. As expected, most respondents were new to farming (1-3 years' experience as a primary owner/operator), and 47% reported having a child under the age of 18 years work on the farm. While respondents recognized farms were generally unsafe for children, they reported their own farm as safe for children. Preferred sources of safety knowledge were those with user-generated content from other farmers. Conclusion: Interventions with new women organic farmers in the Midwest are likely to be most effective by incorporating social media, networking with area farmers' groups, and addressing the optimism bias.

The risk of acute and overuse injuries in HIFT is unclear. This study evaluated the incidence of injuries in HIFT, characterizing severity, location, and associated risk factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and May 2021. HIFT practitioners were recruited through social media and answered an online questionnaire on training characteristics and injury history. Results A total of 606 subjects (264 male and 342 female) were included. The average age of the participants was 29.78 +/- 7.14 years. The mean height was 169.60 +/- 8.96 cm, and the mean body mass was 73.69 +/- 13.11 kg. Overall, participants were involved in HIFT for an average of 25.36 +/- 20.29 months. A total of 58.6% of participants took part in 5 to 6 training sessions per week, 31.7% practiced 5 to 6 h per week. 62.7% of the responders performed other physical activities in parallel, 98.2% performed warm-up before the training, and a formal cooldown was accomplished by 29.4% of participants. 6.8% of athletes followed individual worksheets. 45.9% of participants participated in competition. Conclusions The overall rate of injuries was 3.51/1000 h. 59.2% of subjects experienced two or more injuries. The shoulder was involved in 21.3% of cases, lower back in 18.3%, and the knee in 13.4%. No difference was found in injury rate between males and females. Experienced athletes were more prone to injury compared to those who trained under 12 months. Approximately the half of injuries did not cause training interruption. No difference was found in injury rate between males and females.

The emergence of e-epidemiology offers possibilities for reaching understudied populations as well as conducting large-scale studies. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey focused on self-reported neighborhood characteristics, perceived stress, and feasibility of obtaining work/residential addresses via online recruitment in St. Louis, Missouri, USA from February 2017 to December 2017. We report the process of using Facebook recruitment and demonstrate how this strategy can enhance collection of geospatial data to better understand context and spatial patterns of disease. Results: A total of 425 participants were recruited via Facebook advertisements. All participants reported their residential and work ZIP codes, though only 64.7% and 45.6% provided their complete residential and work street addresses, respectively. Those who reported their complete residential street addresses were more likely to be female (69.8% vs. 56.1% of males, chi(2) = 7.89, 1 df, p = 0.005), though no differences were observed by race, age, or employment status. Discussion: These findings indicate that valuable location data can be successfully collected via Facebook recruitment - data that could potentially include residential history or prospective follow-up time or be combined with other emerging technologies for geographic data in order to better understand the context and the effects of place on health outcomes.

Objective: This retrospective observational study of emergency physician Twitter use details how the health care crisis has influenced emergency physician discourse online and how this discourse may have use as a harbinger of ensuing surge. Methods: Followers of the three main emergency physician professional organizations were identified using Twitter's application programming interface. They and their followers were included in the study if they identified explicitly as US-based emergency physicians. Statuses, or tweets, were obtained between January 4, 2020, when the new disease was first reported, and December 14, 2020, when vaccination first began. Original tweets underwent sentiment analysis using the previously validated Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool as well as topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation unsupervised machine learning. Sentiment and topic trends were then correlated with daily change in new COVID-19 cases and inpatient bed utilization. Results: A total of 3463 emergency physicians produced 334,747 unique English-language tweets during the study period. Out of 3463 participants, 910 (26.3%) stated that they were in training, and 466 of 902 (51.7%) participants who provided their gender identified as men. Overall tweet volume went from a pre-March 2020 mean of 481.9 (SD 72.7) daily tweets to a mean of 1065.5 (SD 257.3) daily tweets thereafter. Parameter and topic number tuning led to 20 tweet topics, with a topic coherence of 0.49. Except for a week in June and 4 days in November, discourse was dominated by the health care system (45,570/334,747, 13.6%). Discussion of pandemic response, epidemiology, and clinical care were jointly found to moderately correlate with COVID-19 hospital bed utilization (Pearson r=0.41), as was the occurrence of covid, coronavirus, or pandemic in tweet texts (r=0.47). Momentum in COVID-19 tweets, as demonstrated by a sustained crossing of 7- and 28-day moving averages, was found to have occurred on an average of 45.0 (SD 12.7) days before peak COVID-19 hospital bed utilization across the country and in the four most contributory states.

While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients, healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively. This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods into the population oral health sciences.",,,,,,"Baker, Sarah/0000-0002-2861-451X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0301-5661,1600-0528,,,,2023 FEB,2023,51,1,,,SI,,79,84,,10.1111/cdoe.12824,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdoe.12824,,FEB 2023,,,,,,36749668,,,,,WOS:000928837400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They have large impacts on quality of life, social and economic conditions. These diseases bring several health risks to those patients suffering from more than one chronic disease at one time (also known as comorbidity of chronic disease). Due to this, governments and healthcare service providers are concerned about the burden of comorbidity of chronic diseases. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide vital information for the prevention and better management of chronic diseases. The routinely collected hospital claim data contain semantic information about patients' health in the form of disease codes. Therefore, these data can be used to understand the progression of chronic disease comorbidities. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple chronic diseases. In this study, we aim to understand the progression of multiple chronic diseases, i.e., comorbidities that occur when patients of one chronic condition progress towards another. Based on the prevalence of chronic diseases within the Australian population, we have particularly focused on the comorbidity progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. In this study, we propose a research framework to understand and represent the progression of CHF in patients with T2D using graph theory and social network analysis. We used hospital claim data drawn from the Australian healthcare context. We constructed two baseline disease networks from two cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2D and CHF and patients with only T2D). A final weighted disease network from two cohorts was then generated by giving more weights to the prevalent comorbidities in patients with T2D and CHF compared to the patients with only T2D. The results show that chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular disease and renal failure occurred frequently during the progression of CHF for T2D patients. In addition, the final disease network shows the highest transition between electrolyte disorders and renal failure. This indicates that these two diseases may be potential risk factors for the progression towards CHF in patients with T2D for this population cohort. Thus, the proposed network representation can help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and progression pattern between recurrence of T2D and CHF. Also, it can help in the efficient management of healthcare resources. The proposed framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management program for the patients at high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.",,,,,"Uddin, Shahadat/E-1963-2011","Uddin, Shahadat/0000-0003-0091-6919; Khan, Arif/0000-0002-5793-933X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1860-949X,1860-9503,978-3-030-36683-4; 978-3-030-36682-7,,,,2020,882,,,,,,774,788,,10.1007/978-3-030-36683-4_62,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36683-4_62,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000843839700062,View Full Record in Web of Science

We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Methods Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies. Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were abstracted. Countries with at least one case were dassified as affected. Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100 cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and duster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings. Findings Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries; 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73%) were early cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2%) of 1200 cases were in health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 2.6 cases per cluster [range 2-71), followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 4.3 cases per cluster [2-141), and community gatherings (11[11%]; mean 14.2 cases per cluster [4-36]). Interpretation Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases from affected countries. Among cases with age information available, most were among adults aged 18 years and older.

A better understanding of the beliefs regarding LBP and impact of LBP on the individual is important in order to improve outcomes. Although personal experiences of LBP have traditionally been explored through qualitative studies, social media allows access to data from a large, heterogonous, and geographically distributed population, which is not possible using traditional qualitative or quantitative methods. As data on social media sites are collected in an unsolicited manner, individuals are more likely to express their views and emotions freely and in an unconstrained manner as compared to traditional data collection methods. Thus, content analysis of social media provides a novel approach to understanding how problems such as LBP are perceived by those who experience it and its impact. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify contextual variables of the LBP experience from a first-person perspective to provide insights into individuals' beliefs and perceptions. Methods: We analyzed 896,867 cleaned tweets about LBP between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. We tested and compared latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM), GPU-DMM, biterm topic model, and nonnegative matrix factorization for identifying topics associated with tweets. A coherence score was determined to identify the best model. Two domain experts independently performed qualitative content analysis of the topics with the strongest coherence score and grouped them into contextual categories. The experts met and reconciled any differences and developed the final labels. Results: LDA outperformed all other algorithms, resulting in the highest coherence score. The best model was LDA with 60 topics, with a coherence score of 0.562. The 60 topics were grouped into 19 contextual categories. Emotion and beliefs had the largest proportion of total tweets (157,563/896,867, 17.6%), followed by physical activity (124,251/896,867, 13.85%) and daily life (80,730/896,867, 9%), while food and drink, weather, and not being understood had the smallest proportions (11,551/896,867, 1.29%; 10,109/896,867, 1.13%; and 9180/896,867, 1.02%, respectively). Of the 11 topics within emotion and beliefs, 113,562/157,563 (72%) had negative sentiment. Conclusions: The content analysis of tweets in the area of LBP identified common themes that are consistent with findings from conventional qualitative studies but provide a more granular view of individuals' perspectives related to LBP. This understanding has the potential to assist with developing more effective and personalized models of care to improve outcomes in those with LBP.",,,,,"Delir Haghighi, Pari/AAV-8378-2020; Cicuttini, Flavia/H-4978-2014","Delir Haghighi, Pari/0000-0001-9922-1214; Cicuttini, Flavia/0000-0002-8200-1618",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,DEC 23,2021,23,12,,,,,,,e26093,10.2196/26093,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26093,,,,,,,,36260398,,,,,WOS:000740350000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our aim was to determine if media coverage, number and type of news, can influence the rate of HCV testing. Methods For each calendar year we searched from national, regional and local newspapers for articles published related to HCV between 2001 and 2013 (interferon era) and 2014-2018 (non-interferon era) and the HCV tests performed. Demographics, provider data and test result were collected from patients tested. Results During the studied period, 21 913 press articles were found, and we identified a total of 293 226 HCV tests. A total of 9778 HCV tests from 5237 patients tested positive (1.88%). An inverse correlation was found between media coverage and the number of HCV tests during the interferon era (r(2) = -0.558, P = 0.024), where news concerning epidemiology and burden of the disease were more frequent. By contrast, in the non-interferon era a strong correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.900, P = 0.019), where news related to treatment prevailed.

This study aims to identify key diabetes-related concerns in the USA and primary emotions associated with those concerns using information shared on Twitter. Research design and methods A total of 11.7 million diabetes-related tweets in English were collected between April 2017 and July 2019. Machine learning methods were used to filter tweets with personal content, to geolocate (to the USA) and to identify clusters of tweets with emotional elements. A sentiment analysis was then applied to each cluster. Results We identified 46 407 tweets with emotional elements in the USA from which 30 clusters were identified; 5 clusters (18% of tweets) were related to insulin pricing with both positive emotions (joy, love) referring to advocacy for affordable insulin andsadnessemotions related to the frustration of insulin prices, 5 clusters (12% of tweets) to solidarity and support with a majority ofjoyandloveemotions expressed. The most negative topics (10% of tweets) were related to diabetes distress (24%sadness,27%anger, 21%fearelements), to diabetic and insulin shock (45%anger, 46%fear) and comorbidities (40%sadness). Conclusions Using social media data, we have been able to describe key diabetes-related concerns and their associated emotions.

We hypothesized that kitesurfing has a higher injury rate than other (contact) sports and that the minority of injuries are severe. AIM To investigate the incidence and epidemiology of kitesurfing injuries in a Dutch cohort during a complete kitesurfing season. METHODS Injury data of 194 kitesurfers of various skill levels, riding styles and age were surveyed prospectively during a full kitesurf season. The participants were recruited through the Dutch national kitesurf association, social media, local websites and kitesurf schools. Participants completed digital questionnaires monthly. The amount of time kitesurfing was registered along with all sustained injuries. If an injury was reported, an additional questionnaire explored the type of injury, injury location, severity and the circumstances under which the injury occurred. RESULTS The mean age of participants was 31 years (range, 13-59) and the majority of the study population was male (74.2%). A total of 177 injuries were sustained during 16816 kitesurf hours. The calculated injury rate was 10.5 injuries per 1000 h of kitesurfing. The most common injuries were cuts and abrasions (25.4%), followed by contusions (19.8%), joint sprains (17.5%) and muscle sprains (10.2%). The foot and ankle were the most common site of injury (31.8%), followed by the knee (14.1%) and hand and wrist (10.2%). Most injuries were reported to occur during a trick or jump. Although the majority of injuries were mild, severe injuries like an anterior cruciate ligament tear, a lumbar spine fracture, a bimalleolar ankle fracture and an eardrum rupture were reported.

As emergencies become more complex, it is increasingly important that the required skillset of the emergency response workforce is clearly defined. To enable essential epidemiological activities to be implemented and managed during an emergency, a workforce is required with the right mix of skills, knowledge, experience and local context awareness. This study aims to provide local and international responders with an opportunity to actively contribute to the development of new thinking around emergency response roles and required competencies. In this study, we will develop recommendations using a broad range of evidence to address identified lessons and challenges so that future major emergency responses are culturally and contextually appropriate, and less reliant on long-term international deployments. Method and analysis We will conduct a mixed-methods study using an exploratory sequential study design. The integration of four data sources, including key informant interviews, a scoping literature review, survey and semistructured interviews will allow the research questions to be examined in a flexible, semistructured way, from a range of perspectives.

Despite this high risk of recurrence, adherence to CRC surveillance testing guidelines is poor which increases cancer-related morbidity and potentially, mortality. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with varying surveillance strategies have yielded conflicting evidence regarding the survival benefit associated with surveillance testing. However, due to differences in study protocols and limitations of sample size and length of follow-up, the RCT may not be the best study design to evaluate this relationship. An observational comparative effectiveness research study can overcome the sample size/follow-up limitations of RCT designs while assessing realworld variability in receipt of surveillance testing to provide much needed evidence on this important clinical issue. The gap in knowledge that this study will address concerns whether adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network CRC surveillance guidelines improves survival.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to contain it, searches for socially distanced activities have trended. We hypothesize that trends in the volume of search queries related to activities associated with COVID-19 transmission correlate with subsequent COVID-19 caseloads. We present a preliminary analytics framework that examines the relationship between Google search queries and the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. We designed an experimental tool with search volume indices to track interest in queries related to two themes: isolation and mobility. Our goal was to capture the underlying social dynamics of an unprecedented pandemic using alternative data sources that are new to epidemiology. Our results indicate that the net movement index we defined correlates with COVID-19 weekly new case growth rate with a lag of between 10 and 14 days for the United States at-large, as well as at the state level for 42 out of 50 states with the exception of 8 states (DE, IA, KS, NE, ND, SD, WV, WY) from March to June 2020. In addition, an increasing caseload was seen over the summer in some southern US states. A sharp rise in mobility indices was followed by a sharp increase, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas.

All three networks are small worlds characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps.

This study used reports from a 2018 national health promotion survey (n = 11,373) to quantitatively explore why such gender-based differences exist among young Canadians.Using mediation analyses and contemporary social theory, we explored mechanisms that may explain dif-ferences in mental health between adolescents who identify as boys versus girls. The potential mediators tested were social supports within family and friends, engagement in addictive social media use, and overt risk-taking. Analyses were performed with the full sample and in specific high-risk groups, such as adolescents who report lower family affluence. Higher levels of addictive social media use and lower perceived levels of family support among girls mediated a significant proportion of the difference between boys and girls for each of the three mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, frequent health complaints, and diagnosis of mental illness). Observed mediation effects were similar in high-risk subgroups; however, among those with low affluence, effects of family support were somewhat more pronounced.Study findings point to deeper, root causes of gender-based mental health inequalities that emerge during childhood. Interventions designed to reduce girls' addictive social media use or increase their perceived family support, to be more in line with their male peers, could help to reduce differences in mental health between boys and girls.

Objective: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using the Web-based social media platform Twitter to detect psychological and behavioral characteristics of self-identified persons with ASD. Methods: Data from Twitter were retrieved from 152 self-identified users with ASD and 182 randomly selected control users from March 22, 2012 to July 20, 2017. We conducted a between-group comparative textual analysis of tweets about repetitive and obsessive-compulsive behavioral characteristics typically associated with ASD. In addition, common emotional characteristics of persons with ASD, such as fear, paranoia, and anxiety, were examined between groups through textual analysis. Furthermore, we compared the timing of tweets between users with ASD and control users to identify patterns in communication. Results: Users with ASD posted a significantly higher frequency of tweets related to the specific repetitive behavior of counting compared with control users (P<. 001). The textual analysis of obsessive-compulsive behavioral characteristics, such as fixate, excessive, and concern, were significantly higher among users with ASD compared with the control group (P<. 001). In addition, emotional terms related to fear, paranoia, and anxiety were tweeted at a significantly higher rate among users with ASD compared with control users (P<.001). Users with ASD posted a smaller proportion of tweets during time intervals of 00: 00-05: 59 (P<.001), 06: 00-11: 59 (P<.001), and 18: 00-23.59 (P<. 001), as well as a greater proportion of tweets from 12: 00 to 17: 59 (P<. 001) compared with control users. Conclusions: Social media may be a valuable resource for observing unique psychological characteristics of self-identified persons with ASD. Collecting and analyzing data from these digital platforms may afford opportunities to identify the characteristics of ASD and assist in the diagnosis or verification of ASD.

Because people at risk for syphilis might seek sexual health and risk-related information on the internet, we investigated associations between internet state-level search query data (e.g., Google Trends) and reported weekly syphilis cases. Methods: We obtained weekly counts of reported primary and secondary syphilis for 50 states from 2012 to 2014 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We collected weekly internet search query data regarding 25 risk-related keywords from 2012 to 2014 for 50 states using Google Trends. We joined 155 weeks of Google Trends data with 1-week lag to weekly syphilis data for a total of 7750 data points. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we trained three linear mixed models on the first 10 weeks of each year. We validated models for 2012 and 2014 for the following 52 weeks and the 2014 model for the following 42 weeks. Results: The models, consisting of different sets of keyword predictors for each year, accurately predicted 144 weeks of primary and secondary syphilis counts for each state, with an overall average R-2 of 0.9 and overall average root mean squared error of 4.9. Conclusions: We used Google Trends search data from the prior week to predict cases of syphilis in the following weeks for each state.

Time is brain when it comes to the detection and treatment of a stroke as it can reduce morbidity and disability in the long run. May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR #strokemonth OR #strokewarenessmonth and stroke OR #stroke. Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term 'stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have been 3.14% and 1.35%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the event had primary involvement from the United States and the United Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents, especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally. The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and global health.",,,,,"Malhotra, Kashish/ABT-8009-2022","Malhotra, Kashish/0000-0002-6985-5731; Goyal, Kashish/0000-0002-6997-7691",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,SEP 10,2022,14,9,,,,,,,e28997,10.7759/cureus.28997,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28997,,,,,,,,36249610,,,,,WOS:000856781800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social media platforms such as Twitter provide a novel source of data for observational research.Objective: We aimed to identify posts on Twitter (or tweets) related to scanxiety, describe the volume and content of these tweets, and describe the demographics of users posting about scanxiety.Methods: We manually searched for scanxiety and associated keywords in cancer-related, publicly available, English-language tweets posted between January 2018 and December 2020. We defined conversations as a primary tweet (the first tweet about scanxiety) and subsequent tweets (interactions stemming from the primary tweet). User demographics and the volume of primary tweets were assessed. Conversations underwent inductive thematic and content analysis.Results: A total of 2031 unique Twitter users initiated a conversation about scanxiety from cancer-related scans. Most were patients (n=1306, 64%), female (n=1343, 66%), from North America (n=1130, 56%), and had breast cancer (449/1306, 34%). There were 3623 Twitter conversations, with a mean of 101 per month (range 40-180). Five themes were identified. The first theme was experiences of scanxiety, identified in 60% (2184/3623) of primary tweets, which captured the personal account of scanxiety by patients or their support person. Scanxiety was often described with negative adjectives or similes, despite being experienced differently by users. Scanxiety had psychological, physical, and functional impacts. Contributing factors to scanxiety included the presence and duration of uncertainty, which was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second theme (643/3623, 18%) was the acknowledgment of scanxiety, where users summarized or labeled an experience as scanxiety without providing emotive clarification, and advocacy of scanxiety, where users raised awareness of scanxiety without describing personal experiences. The third theme was messages of support (427/3623, 12%), where users expressed well wishes and encouraged positivity for people experiencing scanxiety. The fourth theme was strategies to reduce scanxiety (319/3623, 9%), which included general and specific strategies for patients and strategies that required improvements in clinical practice by clinicians or health care systems. The final theme was research about scanxiety (50/3623, 1%), which included tweets about the epidemiology, impact, and contributing factors of scanxiety as well as novel strategies to reduce scanxiety.Conclusions: Scanxiety was often a negative experience described by patients having cancer-related scans. Social media platforms like Twitter enable individuals to share their experiences and offer support while providing researchers with unique data to improve their understanding of a problem. Acknowledging scanxiety as a term and increasing awareness of scanxiety is an important first step in reducing scanxiety.

However, the dynamic data of existing online social media platforms are not readily accessible. Hence, there is a necessity to synthesize networks emulating those of online social media for further study. In this work, we propose an epidemiology-inspired and community-based, time-evolving online social network generation algorithm (EpiCNet), to generate a time-evolving sequence of random networks that closely mirror the characteristics of real-world online social networks. Variants of the algorithm can produce both undirected and directed networks to accommodate different user interaction paradigms. EpiCNet utilizes compartmental models inspired by mathematical epidemiology to simulate the flow of individuals into and out of the online social network. It also employs an overlapping community structure to enable more realistic connections between individuals in the network. Furthermore, EpiCNet evolves the community structure and connections in the simulated online social network as a function of time and with an emphasis on the behavior of individuals. EpiCNet is capable of simulating a variety of online social networks by adjusting a set of tunable parameters that specify the individual behavior and the evolution of communities over time. The experimental results show that the network properties of the synthetic time-evolving online social network generated by EpiCNet, such as clustering coefficient, node degree, and diameter, match those of typical real-world online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,JAN 29,2023,13,1,,,,,,,2395,10.1038/s41598-023-29443-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29443-w,,,,,,,,36765153,,,,,WOS:001024680800065,View Full Record in Web of Science

A major obstacle, however, is to differentiate them from the large majority of tweets on other topics posted in a user's timeline: solving the infamous 'needle in a haystack' problem. While deep learning models have significantly improved classification, their performance and inference processing time remain low on extremely imbalanced corpora where the tweets of interest are less than 1% of all tweets. In this study, we empirically evaluate under-sampling, fine-tuning, and filtering heuristics to train such classifiers. Using a corpus of 212 Twitter timelines (181,607 tweets with only 0.2% tweets mentioning a medication), our results show that combining these heuristics is necessary to impact the classifier's performance. In our intrinsic evaluation, a classifier based on a lexicon and a BERT-base neural network achieved a 0.838 F1-score, a score similar to the score achieved by the best classifier on this task during the #SMM4H'20 competition, but it processed the corpus 28 times faster - a positive result, since processing speed is still a roadblock to deploying classifiers on large cohorts of Twitter users needed for pharmacovigilance.

The authors examined the associations of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations.

We aimed to assess variability in coma definitions, etiologies, treatment strategies, and attitudes toward prognosis. Methods As part of the Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign, between September 2020 and January 2021, we conducted an anonymous, international, cross-sectional global survey of health care professionals caring for patients with coma and disorders of consciousness in the acute, subacute, or chronic setting. Survey responses were solicited by sequential emails distributed by international neuroscience societies and social media. Fleiss kappa values were calculated to assess agreement among respondents. Results The survey was completed by 258 health care professionals from 41 countries. Respondents predominantly were physicians (n = 213, 83%), were from the United States (n = 141, 55%), and represented academic centers (n = 231, 90%). Among eight predefined items, respondents identified the following cardinal features, in various combinations, that must be present to define coma: absence of wakefulness (81%, kappa = 0.764); Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <= 8 (64%, kappa = 0.588); failure to respond purposefully to visual, verbal, or tactile stimuli (60%, kappa = 0.552); and inability to follow commands (58%, kappa = 0.529). Reported etiologies of coma encountered included medically induced coma (24%), traumatic brain injury (24%), intracerebral hemorrhage (21%), and cardiac arrest/hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (11%). The most common clinical assessment tools used for coma included the GCS (94%) and neurological examination (78%). Sixty-six percent of respondents routinely performed sedation interruption, in the absence of contraindications, for clinical coma assessments in the intensive care unit. Advanced neurological assessment techniques in comatose patients included quantitative electroencephalography (EEG)/connectivity analysis (16%), functional magnetic resonance imaging (7%), single-photon emission computerized tomography (6%), positron emission tomography (4%), invasive EEG (4%), and cerebral microdialysis (4%). The most commonly used neurostimulants included amantadine (51%), modafinil (37%), and methylphenidate (28%). The leading determinants for prognostication included etiology of coma, neurological examination findings, and neuroimaging. Fewer than 20% of respondents reported routine follow-up of coma survivors after hospital discharge; however, 86% indicated interest in future research initiatives that include postdischarge outcomes at six (85%) and 12 months (65%). Conclusions There is wide heterogeneity among health care professionals regarding the clinical definition of coma and limited routine use of advanced coma assessment techniques in acute care settings. Coma management practices vary across sites, and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained follow-up after acute treatment are inconsistent. There is an urgent need for the development of evidence-based guidelines and a collaborative, coordinated approach to advance both the science and the practice of coma management globally.",,,,,"Ulmer, Hanno/S-6615-2019; Giacino, Joseph/AAF-1952-2021; Helbok, Raimund/AAA-8361-2021; Citerio, Giuseppe/B-1839-2015; Rass, Verena/AAR-1731-2021","Ulmer, Hanno/0000-0001-5911-1002; Giacino, Joseph/0000-0002-7916-9698; Citerio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-5374-3161; Kondziella, Daniel/0000-0001-5562-9808",,,,,,,,,,,,,1541-6933,1556-0961,,,,2022 AUG,2022,37,1,,,,,47,59,,10.1007/s12028-021-01425-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12028-021-01425-8,,FEB 2022,,,,,,35141860,,,,,WOS:000753248900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design Cross-sectional survey carried out between 5 May and 5 June 2021. Participants and setting 4198 individuals from urban and rural settings in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone participated in the survey. Study registration The general protocol is registered on clinicaltrial.gov. Results Findings show that in West Africa at the time only 53% of all study participants reported to be aware of COVID-19 vaccines, and television (60%, n=1345), radio (56%; n=1258), social media (34%; n=764) and family/friends/neighbours (28%; n=634) being the most important sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Adult COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ranges from 60% in Guinea and 50% in Sierra Leone to 11% in Senegal. This is largely congruent with acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccinations for children. Multivariable regression analysis shows that perceived effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines increased the willingness to get vaccinated. However, sociodemographic factors, such as sex, rural/urban residence, educational attainment and household composition (living with children and/or elderly), and the other perception parameters were not associated with the willingness to get vaccinated in the multivariable regression model. Conclusions Primary sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines include television, radio and social media.

Timely and accurate forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic is key to sustaining interventions and policies and efficient resource allocation. Internet-based data sources have shown great potential to supplement traditional infectious disease surveillance, and the combination of different Internet-based data sources has shown greater power to enhance epidemic forecasting accuracy than using a single Internet-based data source. However, existing methods incorporating multiple Internet-based data sources only used real-time data from these sources as exogenous inputs but did not take all the historical data into account. Moreover, the predictive power of different Internet-based data sources in providing early warning for COVID-19 outbreaks has not been fully explored. Objective: The main aim of our study is to explore whether combining real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve the COVID-19 forecasting accuracy over the existing baseline models. A secondary aim is to explore the COVID-19 forecasting timeliness based on different Internet-based data sources. Methods: We first used core terms and symptom-related keyword-based methods to extract COVID-19-related Internet-based data from December 21, 2019, to February 29, 2020. The Internet-based data we explored included 90,493,912 online news articles, 37,401,900 microblogs, and all the Baidu search query data during that period. We then proposed an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs, incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources. Our proposed model was compared with baseline models, and all the models were tested during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemics in Hubei province and the rest of mainland China separately. We also used lagged Pearson correlations for COVID-19 forecasting timeliness analysis.Results: Our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy in all 5 accuracy measures, compared with all the baseline models of both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China. In mainland China, except for Hubei, the COVID-19 epidemic forecasting accuracy differences between our proposed model (model i) and all the other baseline models were statistically significant (model 1, t198=-8.722, P <.001; model 2, t198=-5.000, P <.001, model 3, t198=-1.882, P=.06; model 4, t198=-4.644, P <.001; model 5, t198=-4.488, P <.001). In Hubei province, our proposed model's forecasting accuracy improved significantly compared with the baseline model using historical new confirmed COVID-19 case counts only (model 1, t198=-1.732, P=.09). Our results also showed that Internet-based sources could provide a 2-to 6-day earlier warning for COVID-19 outbreaks.Conclusions: Our approach incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve forecasting accuracy for epidemics of COVID-19 and its variants, which may help improve public health agencies' interventions and resource allocation in mitigating and controlling new waves of COVID-19 or other relevant epidemics.",,,,,"huang, wen/GXW-0661-2022; Huang, WW/GXH-0977-2022; Chen, Zhuo/A-1261-2007","Huang, wayne/0000-0001-7150-0844; Wang, Qingnan/0000-0002-4373-8000; SIA, Choon Ling/0000-0002-9778-9196; Chen, Zhuo/0000-0002-5351-3489; Li, Jingwei/0000-0002-6129-2751",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,JUN,2022,8,6,,,,,,,e35266,,,,,,,,,,35507921,,,,,WOS:000828155000018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20%) exporting/importing more than 90% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.",,,,,"wang, youming/HJB-0541-2022","Tang, Hao/0000-0002-3932-4016; CAI, CHANG/0000-0002-1122-3045; Bruce, Mieghan/0000-0003-3176-2094",,,,,,,,,,,,,1865-1674,1865-1682,,,,2022 JUL,2022,69,4,,,,,E775,E787,,10.1111/tbed.14351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14351,,NOV 2021,,,,,,34693647,,,,,WOS:000714419500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: A literature search to identify CPGs revised since 2019 that provide recommendations regarding the five intra-articular injection treatments for knee OA (corticosteroid [CS], hyaluronic acid [HA], stem cell [SC], platelet-rich plasma [PRP], and botulinum toxin [BT]) was conducted to assess perspective changes for each treatment. Data from Google Trends were examined to identify changes in search volume from 2004 to 2021 using a join-point regression model. Relevant YouTube videos were divided into those uploaded before and after changes in CPGs and compared according to degrees of recom-mendation for each treatment to identify the effect of changes in CPGs on video production. Results: All eight identified CPGs released after 2019 recommended HA and CS use. Most CPGs were the first to state a neutral or opposing stance concerning the use of SC, PRP, or BT. Interestingly, relative searches on Google for SC, PRP, and BT has increased greater than those for CS and HA. YouTube videos produced after CPGs changed continue to recommend SC, PRP, and BT as much as those produced before CPGs were revised. Conclusions: Although knee OA CPGs have changed, public interest and healthcare information providers on YouTube have not reacted to this shift.

J,"Lee, M; You, M",,,,"Lee, Minjung; You, Myoungsoon",,,Direct and Indirect Associations of Media Use With COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in South Korea: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has not concluded. Despite the availability of vaccines, the high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy represents a significant challenge to public health, and raising vaccine acceptance among the public is critical. Although media has become an increasingly popular source of COVID-19 vaccine-related information, the question of whether and how media use is related to the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants exploration. Objective: This study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, (2) identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (3) explore the direct and indirect relationship between media use and vaccine hesitancy through psychological factors. Methods: A month before COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in South Korea, we conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey over 6 days (January 20-25, 2021). This study included 1016 participants, and a logit model for regression analyzed associations between sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, psychological factors, and media use toward one's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, we conducted a path analysis to examine the indirect effects of media use on vaccine hesitancy by using psychological factors (ie, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of COVID-19 vaccination). Results: Among the participants (N=1016), 53.3% (541/1016) hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 46.7% (475/1016) agreed to accept the vaccine. Of the sociodemographic factors, female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.967, 95% CI 1.36-2.86; P<.001), age in 50s (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.96; P=.004), and age over 60s (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.99; P=.04) were significant individual predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Perceived susceptibility of infection (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) and perceived benefits of vaccination (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Perceived barriers of vaccination (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.29-2.07; P<.001) and lower trust in government (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98; P=.04) were related to vaccine hesitancy. The use of offline and online media as sources for the perceived benefits of vaccination was associated with vaccine hesitancy, resulting in lower vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, perceived susceptibility of the disease and perceived barriers of vaccination mediated the association between social media use and vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Our findings revealed a considerable level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in South Korea. Gender-based and generation-based public health policies and communication are recommended. Efforts to lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived benefits of the vaccine are required. Although the use of media has a positive and negative effect on the population's vaccine hesitancy, efforts should be made to disseminate reliable and timely information on media while confronting misinformation or disinformation for successive implementation of vaccine programs during pandemics.",,,,,"You, Myoungsoon/AAQ-5431-2020","Lee, Minjung/0000-0002-0479-6523",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JAN 6,2022,24,1,,,,,,,e32329,10.2196/32329,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32329,,,,,,,,34870605,,,,,WOS:000766777200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence-based treatment options are scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address affected individuals in their online setting. This study presents a newly developed IMI for IUD disclosing treatment satisfaction and preliminary effects by exemplifying with a case report. Methods: The case of a female participant with IUD, characterized by an excessive use of social media, is analyzed. The case report follows the CARE guidelines and presents qualitative and quantitative outcomes regarding potential symptom reduction measured by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS), treatment satisfaction measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) and feasibility by analyzing participant's written feedback during treatment. Results: The case report shows that internet- and mobile-based interventions may be feasible in supporting an individual in reducing symptoms of IUD as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and procrastination behavior. Treatment satisfaction was reported as good. Discussion and conclusions: This case report illustrates that IMIs can have the potential to be an easily accessible and possibly effective treatment option for IUD.

This study presents an exploration into the utility of incorporating internet-based data to better understand smallholder farming communities within the UK, by using online text extraction and the subsequent mining of this data. Web scraping of the livestock fora was conducted, with text mining and topic modelling of data in search of common themes, words, and topics found within the text, in addition to temporal analysis through anomaly detection. Results revealed that some of the key areas in pig forum discussions included identification, age management, containment, and breeding and weaning practices. In discussions about poultry farming, a preference for free-range practices was expressed, along with a focus on feeding practices and addressing red mite infestations. Temporal topic modelling revealed an increase in conversations around pig containment and care, as well as poultry equipment maintenance. Moreover, anomaly detection was discovered to be particularly effective for tracking unusual spikes in forum activity, which may suggest new concerns or trends. Internet data can be a very effective tool in aiding traditional veterinary surveillance methods, but the requirement for human validation of said data is crucial.

This makes their application unrealistic in cases where multiple pathogens with similar symptoms are spreading concurrently within the same population. Here we describe a method which makes possible the application of multiple single-strain models under minimal conditions. As such, our method provides a bridge between theoretical models of epidemiology and data-driven approaches for modeling of influenza and other similar viruses. Our model extends the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to higher dimensions, allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple viruses. We further provide a method, based on an overcomplete dictionary of feasible realizations of SIR solutions, to blindly partition the time series representing the number of infected people in a population into individual components, each representing the effect of a single pathogen. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on five years of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, estimated from Twitter data. We demonstrate that our method describes, on average, 44% of the variance in the ILl time series. The individual infectious components derived from our model are matched to known viral profiles in the populations, which we demonstrate matches that of independently collected epidemiological data. We further show that the basic reproductive numbers (RO) of the matched components are in range known for these pathogens. Our results suggest that the proposed method can be applied to other pathogens and geographies, providing a simple method for estimating the parameters of epidemics in a population.

Objective: Our objective was to demonstrate a use case, in which patient-generated data were incorporated in pharmacovigilance, to understand the epidemiology and burden of illness in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods: We used data on systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that substantially impairs quality of life, from 2 independent data sets. To understand the disease's epidemiology, we analyzed a Japanese health insurance claims database. To understand the disease's burden, we analyzed text data collected from Japanese disease blogs (tobyoki) written by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Natural language processing was applied to these texts to identify frequent patient-level complaints, and term frequency-inverse document frequency was used to explore patient burden during treatment. We explored health-related quality of life based on patient descriptions. Results: We analyzed data from 4694 and 635 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in the health insurance claims database and tobyoki blogs, respectively. Based on health insurance claims data, the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is 107.70 per 100,000 persons. Tobyoki text data analysis showed that pain-related words (eg, pain, severe pain, arthralgia) became more important after starting treatment. We also found an increase in patients' references to mobility and self-care over time, which indicated increased attention to physical disability due to disease progression. Conclusions: A classical medical database represents only a part of a patient's entire treatment experience, and analysis using solely such a database cannot represent patient-level symptoms or patient concerns about treatments.

Mathematical models of transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data. However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within two secondary schools in England and test for associations between self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates from the local community were also sequenced to assess the representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission, increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age children may be an important source of community transmission.",,,,,"Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011; Holmes, Mark/JVO-1478-2024","Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958; Bellis, Katherine L/0000-0001-5368-7027; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-5454-1625; Aggarwal, Dinesh/0000-0002-5938-8172",,,,,,,,,,,,,2057-5858,,,,,APR,2023,9,4,,,,,,,993,10.1099/mgen.0.000993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000993,,,,,,,,37074324,,,,,WOS:000974293800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study was to describe the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos on the subject of E. coli to determine what consumers are viewing related to the hazards of, and reducing risk of exposure to, bacteria such as E. coli. Methods: The search term was conducted using the keywords E. coli. The 100 videos with the top view counts were included in this study. The sampling frame for this study included only videos that were in English. The source of the upload of each video was determined to be one of the following: (1) consumer, (2) professional (MD, RN)/government, (3) any news (television-based, internet-based, or print/radio). Content categories were created using a fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Videos uploaded by a news source tended to have been uploaded more recently (2015-2018) compared to other sources (p < 0.001). Videos uploaded by consumers or news sources tended to have more views than professional/government-uploaded videos (p=0.044). Videos uploaded by news sources were more likely to mention a specific outbreak (p < 0.001), statistics (p = 0.004), and transmission via raw meat (p = 0.036), feces (p = 0.006), vegetables or produce (p = 0.006), and processing techniques (p = 0.005). Conclusions: YouTube videos on the topic were widely divergent, and varied in content, emphasizing different aspects of concern over hazards associated with E. coli. Consumer sources, rather than experts, were the most common source of upload of the most highly viewed videos. Government agencies, which collect and analyze public health data, do not appear to use YouTube effectively to disseminate information. This underscores the need for media to work with government agencies to provide accurate, timely information to the public. (C) 2019 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control.

J,"Thakur, N",,,,"Thakur, Nirmalya",,,Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis of the Public Discourse on Twitter about COVID-19 and MPox,BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mining and analysis of the big data of Twitter conversations have been of significant interest to the scientific community in the fields of healthcare, epidemiology, big data, data science, computer science, and their related areas, as can be seen from several works in the last few years that focused on sentiment analysis and other forms of text analysis of tweets related to Ebola, E-Coli, Dengue, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Measles, Zika virus, H1N1, influenza-like illness, swine flu, flu, Cholera, Listeriosis, cancer, Liver Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, kidney disease, lupus, Parkinson's, Diphtheria, and West Nile virus. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and MPox have served as catalysts for Twitter usage related to seeking and sharing information, views, opinions, and sentiments involving both of these viruses. None of the prior works in this field analyzed tweets focusing on both COVID-19 and MPox simultaneously. To address this research gap, a total of 61,862 tweets that focused on MPox and COVID-19 simultaneously, posted between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023, were studied. The findings and contributions of this study are manifold. First, the results of sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) approach shows that nearly half the tweets (46.88%) had a negative sentiment. It was followed by tweets that had a positive sentiment (31.97%) and tweets that had a neutral sentiment (21.14%), respectively. Second, this paper presents the top 50 hashtags used in these tweets. Third, it presents the top 100 most frequently used words in these tweets after performing tokenization, removal of stopwords, and word frequency analysis. The findings indicate that tweets in this context included a high level of interest regarding COVID-19, MPox and other viruses, President Biden, and Ukraine. Finally, a comprehensive comparative study that compares the contributions of this paper with 49 prior works in this field is presented to further uphold the relevance and novelty of this work.",,,,,,"Thakur, Nirmalya/0000-0002-3225-1870",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2504-2289,,,,JUN,2023,7,2,,,,,,,116,10.3390/bdcc7020116,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bdcc7020116,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001013910500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: MSM and TGW in Bangkok and Pattaya who exchanged sex in the last year (n = 890) were recruited through social media, outreach, and word-of-mouth. Recent sex exchange was based on the primary question, In the last 30 days, have you sold or traded sex; secondary questions (regarding income source and client encounters) were also investigated. Results: Overall, 436 (48%) participants engaged in sex work in the last 30 days; among those, 270 (62%) reported exchanging sex by the primary question, and 160 (37%) based on secondary questions only. Recent sex exchange was associated with gonorrhea, syphilis, discussing PrEP with others, and using condoms, alcohol, methamphetamine, amyl nitrate, and Viagra. Exchanging sex based on secondary questions only was associated with being in a relationship, social media recruitment, less recent anal intercourse, and not discussing PrEP. Conclusions: Thai MSM and TGW who exchange sex need regular access to HIV/STI prevention, testing, and treatment services, and multiple approaches to assessing sex work will help identify and serve this diverse and dynamic population.

The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide attempts to explain suicide etiology and proposes that feelings of perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness lead to suicide ideation, but this has not been extensively studied in adolescents. This study aimed to use the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to examine factors that may be associated with suicide ideation in adolescents. The factors of interest were school connectedness, perceived availability of support, self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hopelessness, bullying and cyberbullying victimization, substance use, and social media use. Methods Data were from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a survey of 7th to 12th graders enrolled in a publicly funded school in Ontario. Weighted multivariate logistic regression of suicide ideation on all exposure variables was conducted. Results 13.6% of students in the sample endorsed having suicidal ideation in the preceding 12 months. Not knowing where to turn to for support, feeling worthless, endorsing low self-esteem, being bullied, and using cannabis were each associated with greater odds of suicide ideation. Feeling hopeless, social media use, using alcohol and tobacco, and being cyberbullied were not associated with suicide ideation in the weighted multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusions This study is consistent with the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness, two indicators of perceived burdensomeness, and not knowing where to turn to for support, an indicator of thwarted belongingness, were associated with greater odds of suicide ideation. These findings can help guide interventions aimed at reducing the burden of suicidality during adolescence and demonstrate the need to provide accessible mental health support for youth.",,,,,,"Rakoff, Jonah/0000-0002-5155-691X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0706-7437,1497-0015,,,,2023 MAY,2023,68,5,,,,,327,337,,10.1177/07067437221111364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/07067437221111364,,JUL 2022,,,,,,35822268,,,,,WOS:000824718800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit 13,000 individuals with AN and ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research. Methods: ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H. Results: Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable. Conclusions: Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some countries.

Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time. Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated. Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study.

It is thus of utmost importance to map the dissemination of information by mainstream media outlets and the public response to this information. However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize the media coverage and collective internet response to the COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada Methods: We collected a heterogeneous data set including 227,768 web-based news articles and 13,448 YouTube videos published by mainstream media outlets, 107,898 user posts and 3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views of COVID-19-related Wikipedia pages. To analyze the relationship between media coverage, epidemic progression, and users' collective web-based response, we considered a linear regression model that predicts the public response for each country given the amount of news exposure. We also applied topic modelling to the data set using nonnegative matrix factorization. Results: Our results show that public attention, quantified as user activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage; meanwhile, this activity declines rapidly while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, using an unsupervised, dynamic topic modeling approach, we show that while the levels of attention dedicated to different topics by media outlets and internet users are in good accordance, interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. Conclusions: Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perception and response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on people's collective awareness and risk perception and thus on their tendencies toward behavioral change.",,,,,"Gozzi, Nicolò/JCO-3332-2023; Ciulla, Fabio/AFS-2169-2022","Ciulla, Fabio/0000-0002-2637-1737; Gozzi, Nicolo/0000-0002-9996-3194; Panisson, Andre/0000-0002-3336-0374; starnini, michele/0000-0002-9161-5339; Tizzani, Michele/0000-0003-3068-5111; Perra, Nicola/0000-0002-5559-3064",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,OCT 12,2020,22,10,,,,,,,e21597,10.2196/21597,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21597,,,,,,,,32960775,,,,,WOS:000585061300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Epi Info V.7.2 and SPSS V.20 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Outcome Knowledge level. Results A total of 828 participants was involved with a response rate of 98%. Women were 61.7%. Participants' mean (+/- SD) age was 39 (+/- 14) years. Of the total participants 54.11% (95% CI 50.6% to 57.6%) had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 prevention. Significant associations were reported among women (AOR=1.41; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.92); age >= 65 years (AOR=2.72; 95% CI 1.45 to 5.11); rural residence (AOR=2.69; 95% CI 1.78 to 4.07); unable to read and write (AOR=1.60; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.51); information not heard from healthcare workers, mass media and social media (AOR=1.95; 95% CI 1.35 to 2.82), (AOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.58 to 4.19) and (AOR=2.13; 95% CI 1.33 to 3.42), respectively, with inadequate knowledge. Conclusion These findings revealed that more than 50% of participants had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19. It highlights the need for widespread awareness campaigns about COVID-19 through mass media, healthcare professionals and social media as sources of information. House-to-house awareness creation is recommended to address older adults who are more vulnerable to the pandemic.",,,,,"Tadesse, Abay Woday/AAI-4504-2020; Mekonen, Asnakew Molla/ABA-7257-2020; Bogale, Getahun Gebre/AFN-6695-2022","Tadesse, Abay Woday/0000-0003-0499-4690; Mekonen, Asnakew Molla/0000-0001-7573-1594; Bogale, Getahun Gebre/0000-0002-2594-9488; Muluneh Kassa, Ayesheshim/0000-0003-4774-8107",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,,2020,10,11,,,,,,,e044202,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044202,,,,,,,,33191269,,,,,WOS:000595137100023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mental aspects and sleep quality seem to be important potential risk factors, yet their association with RRIs needs to be elucidated. The aims of this study are to investigate the epidemiology of RRIs in recreational runners and the association of mental aspects, sleep, and other potential factors with RRIs. An internet-based questionnaire was sent to recreational runners recruited through social media, asking for personal and training characteristics, mental aspects (obsessive passion, motivation to exercise), sleep quality, perceived health, quality of life, foot arch type, and RRIs over the past six months. Data were analyzed descriptively and using logistic regression. Self-reported data from 804 questionnaires were analyzed. Twenty-five potential risk factors for RRIs were investigated. 54% of runners reported at least one RRI. The knee was the most-affected location (45%), followed by the lower leg (19%). Patellofemoral pain syndrome was the most-reported injury (20%), followed by medial tibial stress syndrome (17%). Obsessive passionate attitude (odds ratio (OR):1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.18-1.54), motivation to exercise (OR:1.09; CI:1.03-1.15), and sleep quality (OR:1.23; CI:1.15-1.31) were associated with RRIs, as were perceived health (OR:0.96; CI:0.94-0.97), running over 20 km/week (OR:1.58; CI:1.04-2.42), overweight (OR:2.17; CI:1.41-3.34), pes planus (OR:1.80; CI:1.12-2.88), hard-surface running (OR:1.37; CI:1.17-1.59), running company (OR:1.65; CI:1.16-2.35), and following a training program (OR:1.51; CI:1.09-2.10). These factors together explained 30% of the variance in RRIs. A separate regression analysis showed that mental aspects and sleep quality explain 15% of the variance in RRIs. The association of mental aspects and sleep quality with RRIs adds new insights into the multifactorial etiology of RRIs. We therefore recommend that besides common risk factors for RRI, mental aspects and sleep be incorporated into the advice on prevention and management of RRIs.",,,,,"Rajabi, Reza/GXM-9107-2022","Rajabi, Reza/0000-0002-0464-5688; Zwerver, Johannes/0000-0002-8499-2806",,,,,,,,,,,,,1303-2968,,,,,JUN,2021,20,2,,,,,204,215,,10.52082/jssm.2021.204,http://dx.doi.org/10.52082/jssm.2021.204,,,,,,,,33948098,,,,,WOS:000642336900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.",,,,,"Li, Yin/AAE-6546-2022; wang, youming/HJB-0541-2022","Li, Yin/0000-0001-5720-5267;",,,,,,,,,,,,,1865-1674,1865-1682,,,,2020 MAY,2020,67,3,,,,,1315,1329,,10.1111/tbed.13472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13472,,JAN 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000506822100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We evaluated whether social media reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and natural catastrophes. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan. Main outcome measure We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and epidemic incidence in Taiwan. Results With our approach, we noted that keywords (sic)(sic) ('common cold'), (sic)(sic) ('fever') and (sic)(sic) ('cough') exhibited good to excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza incidence (r=0.898, p < 0.001; r=0.773, p < 0.001; r=0.796, p < 0.001, respectively).

We present a protocol for a repeated self-report survey assessing risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being in school pupils aged 8-18 years with different socioeconomic backgrounds in England. The survey will provide a comprehensive picture of mental health and associated risks at the community level to inform the development of primary and secondary prevention and treatment strategies in schools. Methods and analysis This protocol is for a large-scale online repeated self-report survey, representative of children and adolescents aged 8-18 years attending schools or further education colleges in participating counties in England. The survey consists of around 300 questions, including validated measures of mental health and well-being, risk and protective factors, and care-seeking behaviour and preferences. Additional questions each year vary to address current events and novel hypotheses, developed by the research team, collaborators and stakeholders. Primary analyses will investigate current and changing risk and protective factors, care-seeking behaviour and attitudes to allowing linkage of their sensitive data to other databases for research, and will compare measures of mental health to measures of well-being. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the University of Oxford Research Ethics Committee (Reference: R62366). Tailored data summaries will be provided to participating schools and stakeholders within 3 months of data collection.

They are selected for different levels of impact from the pandemic.FindingsThe solidarity among the Thai people was a key contributing factor to societal resilience during the pandemic. Findings illustrate how three levels of social capital structure-family, community and local networks-mobilised resources from internal and external social networks to support people affected by the pandemic. The results also highlight different types of resources mobilised from the three levels of social capital, factors that affect resilience, collective action to combat the negative impacts of the pandemic, and the roles of social media and gender.ConclusionSocial capital plays significant roles in the resilience of individuals, households and communities to respond to and recover from the impacts of the pandemic. In many instances, social capital is a faster and more efficient response than other kinds of formal support. Social capital can be enhanced by interactions and exchanges in the communities. While face-to-face social contacts are challenged by the need for social distancing and travel restrictions, social media steps in as alternative socialisation to enhance social capital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,JAN,2023,13,1,,,,,,,e061647,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061647,,,,,,,,36669841,,,,,WOS:000924570800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social media is increasingly being used to promote it. This study aims to investigate the field of diabetes and obesity and related tweets in the context of health and disease. The database extracted using academic APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allowed the study to be run with content analysis and sentiment analysis techniques. These two analysis techniques are some of the tools of choice for the intended objectives. Content analysis facilitated the representation of a concept and a connection between two or more concepts, such as diabetes and obesity, on a purely text-based social platform such as Twitter. Sentiment analysis therefore allowed us to explore the emotional aspect related to the collected data related to the representation of such concepts. The results show a variety of representations connected to the two concepts and their correlations. From them it was possible to produce some clusters of elementary contexts and structure narrative and representational dimensions of the investigated concepts. The use of sentiment analysis and content analysis and cluster output to represent complex contexts such as diabetes and obesity for a social media community could increase knowledge of how virtual platforms impact fragile categories, facilitating concrete spillovers into public health strategies.",,,,,,"IAZZETTA, FERDINANDO/0000-0002-5641-8823",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2297-7775,,,,JUN 15,2023,8,,,,,,,,1155849,10.3389/fsoc.2023.1155849,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2023.1155849,,,,,,,,37397627,,,,,WOS:001018704300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed information shared on Twitter in Spanish language for insights into the public's communication and information needs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a mixed-methods analysis using a text mining approach. We used SAS Text Miner, an algorithmic-driven statistical program to capture 10,000 tweets posted between June 3, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We used the following search terms to capture relevant Twitter messages in Spanish language: coronavirus, covid-19, corona, and the hash tags #COVID19 and #Coronavirus. Key text topics were identified and categorized into themes using an emergent content analysis. Results: We identified 12 text topics and six themes: (1) prevention measures, (2) epidemiology/surveillance, (3) economic impact, (4) optimizing nursing workforce, (5) access to reliable information, and (6) call for a response from the local government. Top trending hashtags from our search included #COVID19 (n = 7,098), #Coronavirus (n = 6,394), and #SNTESALUD (n = 2,598). Conclusions: Spanish-language Tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic contained information from health departments and labor unions on the surveillance, prevention, and impact of COVID-19.

As such, the validity of the claim that media-violence must share blame for a rise in aggression in society is suspect. Approach: Here, the authors explain those five errors: (1) Subclinical psychopathologies interact with media messages in detectable ways. Media violence researchers never paid attention to the composition of their participant samples. Consequently, they were never aware of the inherent vulnerabilities, or immunities, to media violence of their participants. (2) Media violence researchers used convenience samples when they should have used random samples to study media violence. The nature of the research questions they were asking required the use of random samples. But, with the use of convenience samples, those samples never matched the populations they were designed to examine. (3) Media violence researchers used expansive variable lists that probably triggered family-wise interaction effects, thus reporting interactions between independent and dependent variables that were meaningless. (4) Most media violence data are correlational. So, researchers used converged data from correlational studies to infer causation. But their convergence procedures were improperly executed, which led to incorrect interpretations. (5) Media violence researchers, from the outset of their work in the 1980s, pathologized media violence first, then set about trying to find out how it presumably harmed society. Those researchers should have considered the idea that media violence is nothing more than mere entertainment for most people. Value: In addition to questioning the claims made by media violence researchers, these five errors serve as a cautionary tale to social media researchers. Scholars investigating the effects of social media use might consider the possibility that social media are nothing more than new modes of communication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-2060,,978-1-83909-111-7; 978-1-83909-112-4,,,,2021,20,,,,,,169,187,,10.1108/S2050-206020210000020015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S2050-206020210000020015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000835284100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Frailty seems to behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter. Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was the main purpose of our study. Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012, mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning, and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms, hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and tertiles of the total FI score. Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8% were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how the nodes are connected changed. Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network. Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of frailty in older adults.",,,,,"García-Peña, Carmen/F-1468-2011; PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/B-7265-2011","García-Peña, Carmen/0000-0002-9380-6964; PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/0000-0003-4374-976X; Parra-Rodriguez, Lorena/0000-0002-1107-1571; Gomez Verjan, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-7186-8067",,,,,,,,,,,,,0531-5565,1873-6815,,,,DEC,2019,128,,,,,,,,110747,10.1016/j.exger.2019.110747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2019.110747,,,,,,,,31665658,,,,,WOS:000498165000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Participants (n = 73) were predominantly male with an average age of 55.53 (SD, 7.3) years. Younger age, having been treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, and hypertension predict higher Web site logins, whereas higher education, comorbidity with hypertension and diabetes, larger family size, and having been treated with percutaneous coronary intervention predict higher chatroom engagement. The Web site logins, Web site data uploads, chatroom nurse consultation, age, number of family members, drinking, and coresidency status were identified as significant correlates and explained 41.8% of the improvement in behavior change. This study demonstrated empirical evidence that Web site visits, health data uploads, and nurse consultations are crucial for behavior modification.

Early nurturing care can lay the foundation for human capital accumulation with lifelong benefits. Conversely, early adversity undermines brain development, learning and future earning.Slums are among the most challenging places to spend those early years and are difficult places to care for a child. Shifting family and work structures mean that paid, largely informal, childcare seems to be becoming the 'new normal' for many preschool children growing up in rapidly urbanising Africa. However, little is known about the quality of this childcare.AimsTo build a rigorous understanding what childcare strategies are used and why in a typical Nairobi slum, with a particular focus on provision and quality of paid childcare. Through this, to inform evaluation of quality and design and implementation of interventions with the potential to reach some of the most vulnerable children at the most critical time in the life course.Methods and analysisMixed methods will be employed. Qualitative research (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) with parents/carers will explore need for and decision-making about childcare. A household survey (of 480 households) will estimate the use of different childcare strategies by parents/carers and associated parent/carer characteristics. Subsequently, childcare providers will be mapped and surveyed to document and assess quality of current paid childcare. Semistructured observations will augment self-reported quality with observable characteristics/practices. Finally, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with childcare providers will explore their behaviours and motivations.

Symptoms of ovarian cancer are non-specific or can be associated with other common conditions, and women experiencing these symptoms have been shown to self-manage them using over-the-counter medication. Results from a recent proof-of-concept study suggest there may be an increase in the purchases of painkillers and indigestion medication 10-12 months before ovarian cancer diagnosis. We propose a case-control study, as part of a larger project called the Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS), to investigate whether a significant change in medication purchases could be an indication for early signs of ovarian cancer, using data already collected through store loyalty cards. Methods and analysis Using a retrospective case-control design, we aim to recruit 500 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer (cases) and 500 women without ovarian cancer (controls) in the UK who hold a loyalty card with at least one participating high street retailer.

A survey was distributed through social media and email distribution lists. The survey was open for 14 days in April 2020 and 2441 participated. Information on IPV, COVID19-related IPV severity, sociodemographics, and COVID19-related behaviors (eg, job loss) were collected. Regression models were used to evaluate COVID19-related IPV severity across victimization types and sociodemographics. 18% screened positive for IPV. Among the respondents that screened positive, 54% stated the victimization remained the same since the COVID19 outbreak, while 17% stated it worsened and 30% stated it got better. The odds of worsening victimization during the pandemic was significantly higher among physical and sexual violence. While the majority of IPV participants reported victimization to remain the same, sexual and physical violence was exacerbated during the early stages of the pandemic. Addressing victimization during the pandemic (and beyond) must be multi-sectorial.",,,,,,"Molsberry, Rebecca/0000-0002-9657-9963",,,,,,,,,,,,,1353-8047,1475-5785,,,,FEB,2021,27,1,,,,,93,97,,10.1136/injuryprev-2020-043831,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2020-043831,,,,,,,,32873603,,,,,WOS:000614247300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

One particularly promising new data collection strategy is the use of Facebook's advertising platform in conjunction with Web-based surveys. Our research team at the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health has used this quick and cost-efficient method to recruit large samples and address unique scientific questions related to cannabis use. In conducting this research, we have gleaned several insights for using this sampling method effectively and have begun to document the characteristics of the resulting data. We believe this information could be useful to other researchers attempting to study cannabis use or, potentially, other health behaviors. The first aim of this paper is to describe case examples of procedures for using Facebook as a survey sampling method for studying cannabis use. We then present several distinctive features of the data produced using this method. Finally, we discuss the utility of this sampling method for addressing specific types of epidemiological research questions. Overall, we believe that sampling with Facebook advertisements and Web surveys is best conceptualized as a targeted, nonprobability-based method for oversampling cannabis users across the United States.",,,,,,"Marsch, Lisa/0000-0001-6429-0965; budney, alan/0000-0001-6308-6823; Borodovsky, Jacob T./0000-0001-7112-5677",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,APR-JUN,2018,4,2,,,,,370,383,e48,10.2196/publichealth.9408,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.9408,,,,,,,,29720366,,,,,WOS:000526815500034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Different wave setups, types of boards, and types of fins, as well as the use of safety equipment, can lead to overuse and injuries. Purpose:To analyze the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors of river surfing-related injuries for different types of waves and to evaluate the usage and appropriateness of safety equipment. Study Design:Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:An online survey was distributed via social media to river surfers in German-speaking countries to collect information on demographics, injury history for the previous 12 months, wave site attended, use of (safety) equipment, and health issues. The survey was accessible between November 2021 and February 2022. Results:A total of 213 participants completed the survey: 195 participants from Germany, 10 from Austria, 6 from Switzerland, and 2 from other countries. The mean age was 36 years (range, 11-73 years), 72% (n = 153) were male, and 10% (n = 22) took part in competitions. Overall, 60% (n = 128) of surfers experienced 741 surfing-related injuries over the previous 12 months. The most common mechanisms of injury were contact with the bottom of the pool/river (n = 75 [35%]), with the board (n = 65 [30%]), and with the fins (n = 57 [27%]). The most frequent injury types were contusions/bruises (n = 256), cuts/lacerations (n = 159), abrasions (n = 152), and overuse (n = 58). Injuries affected mainly the feet/toes (n = 90), head/face (n = 67), hand/fingers (n = 51), knee (n = 49), lower back (n = 49), and thighs (n = 45). Earplugs were used by 50 (24%) participants, and a helmet was used regularly by 38 (18%) participants and never by 175 (82%) participants.

METHODS: Data were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen treatment not needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or death. RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52) were significantly associated with disease severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.00 to 14.31), heart failure (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15), malignancy (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.45 to 4.72), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49) were associated with an increased risk of death.

We sought to examine associations between different types of screen activities (social media, internet, gaming, and TV) and mental health indicators separately for boys and girls. Methods We drew from a nationally representative sample of 13-15-year-old adolescents in the UK (n = 11,427) asking about hours per day spent on specific screen media activities and four mental health indicators: self-harm behavior, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. Results Hours spent on social media and Internet use were more strongly associated with self-harm behaviors, depressive symptoms, low life satisfaction, and low self-esteem than hours spent on electronic gaming and TV watching. Girls generally demonstrated stronger associations between screen media time and mental health indicators than boys (e.g., heavy Internet users were 166% more likely to have clinically relevant levels of depressive symptoms than low users among girls, compared to 75% more likely among boys). Conclusion Thus, not all screen time is created equal; social media and Internet use among adolescent girls are the most strongly associated with compromised mental health. Future research should examine different screen media activities and boys and girls separately where possible. Practitioners should be aware that some types of screen time are more likely to be linked to mental health issues than others.",,,,,"Twenge, Jean M./ABD-6562-2021","Twenge, Jean M./0000-0002-6542-8281",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,2021 FEB,2021,56,2,,,,,207,217,,10.1007/s00127-020-01906-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01906-9,,AUG 2020,,,,,,32743778,,,,,WOS:000554854000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study on information dissemination in social networks has attracted considerable attention. Many evidences show that emotionsof netizens are likely to spread with information and the emotional contagion also affect information dissemination in social networks. In this paper, we propose a cognitive emotional contagion model (CECM) which combines the model of individual characteristics, the topology of a social network, and the changing process as well as evolution of emotion contagion. Distinguished from conventional epidemiology-based models, our CECM model not only considers the changes of individuals' emotional statuses but also the influence of individuals to others during the information dissemination in a social network. Specifically, CECM first models an individual's emotions as emotional attributes and emotional statuses. Using Emotional statuses, we define the process of an individual's emotional change, which could be affected by one's emotional attributes (e.g. personality). CECM also models the network-wise features of an individual, including one's authority and the connection strength to one's neighbors in a social network. Finally, given emotional models and network-wise features of all users in a social network, a series of transition probabilities among the user's emotional status are defined to model the emotional evolution. A series of simulations is conducted to observe the characteristics of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reflect the real-world situation of emotional contagion for different distributions of personality factors.",,,,,"Wang, Jin/KAM-5595-2024; liu, yuhao/JWP-0475-2024; Liu, Haibo/JWP-8549-2024; wang, jun/JPY-3635-2023; Yang, Fan/JVO-8611-2024; xiang, wei/JXL-3308-2024; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023","Liu, Haibo/0000-0002-4213-2883; Hung, Chih-Chieh/0000-0002-6972-6577",,,,,,,,,,,,,1380-7501,1573-7721,,,,2023 MAY 30,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11042-023-15394-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-15394-x,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000999869700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We performed a bibliometric analysis based on PubMed database to characterize the distribution pattern of literature and knowledge structures related to PE. MethodsLiterature pertaining to PE from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, was retrieved from the PubMed database. Bibliographic information was generated using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder (BICOMB). The visualization matrix was established using gCLUTO software. Strategic diagram analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Social network analysis (SNA) was generated using Ucinet6.0 and NetDraw 2.084 software. ResultsOut of all the retrieved MeSH terms and subheadings, 52 MeSH terms/MeSH subheadings with a high frequency were found, and hot subjects were sorted into 6 clusters. The strategy diagram showed that the epidemiology, etiology, and drug therapy of PE were well advanced. In contrast, studies on diagnostic imaging, pathology, and complications of PE were still immature and offered potential research space. Social network analysis showed that marginal topics such as surgical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, prevention and control of postoperative complications, and metabolism and analysis of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were emerging research hotspots.

This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

In social media and scientific journals, some wrong references were given to a normal epidemic curve and also to a log-normal curve/distribution. For many years, textbooks and courses of reputable institutions and scientific journals have disseminated misleading concepts. For example, calling histogram to plots of epidemic curves or using epidemic data to introduce the concept of a Gaussian distribution, ignoring its temporal indexing. Although an epidemic curve may look like a Gaussian curve and be eventually modelled by a Gauss function, it is not a normal distribution or a log-normal, as some authors claim. A pandemic produces highly-complex data and to tackle it effectively statistical and mathematical modelling need to go beyond the onesize-fits-all solution. Classical textbooks need to be updated since pandemics happen and epidemiology needs to provide reliable information to policy recommendations and actions. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Factors that contribute to cardiac patients' lack of participation in rehabilitation programs are patient motivation, logistical difficulties in getting to the rehabilitation facilities, lack of psychosocial elements, and individualization of activities in the rehabilitation programs. Telerehabilitation has been proposed as a new way to address the challenge of engaging and motivating cardiac patients and their partners to participate in rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of cardiac patients and their partners of participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program (TTP). The Teledialog program consisted of a digital rehabilitation plan, transmission of health data from patient's home to hospital and health care center, and an interactive Web portal with information and training videos. Methods: This case study used a theoretical approach combining the community of practice approach and self-determination theory. A triangulation of data collection techniques was used, including documents, participant observation (72 hours), and qualitative interviews with cardiac patients and their partners enrolled in the telerehabilitation group. A total of 14 cardiac patients, 12 patient spouses/partners, and 1 son participated in the study. The participants were interviewed at enrollment in the telerehabilitation program and after 12 weeks of participation in the program. Interview data were analyzed using NVivo 11.0. Results: Patients and their partners found the Web portal ActiveHeart.dk and the electronic rehabilitation (e-rehabilitation) plan to be helpful tools for health education, coordinating rehabilitation goals, creating an overview of the data, and ensuring continuity in the rehabilitation process. The patients felt that the TTP treated them as individuals, gave them a sense of autonomy, and provided enhanced relatedness to health care professionals and partners and a sense of competence as active participants in their own rehabilitation process. Some patients missed being part of a community of practice with other cardiac patients and did not use the Web forum. Patients' partners found that the telerehabilitation program gave them a sense of security and helped them balance their involvement as a partner to the patient and not push the patient too hard. Conclusions: Cardiac patients and their partners found telerehabilitation technologies a useful digital toolbox in the rehabilitation process. Telerehabilitation motivated the patients to integrate rehabilitation activities into their work schedule and everyday life and made them feel like unique individuals. Participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program might not be a suitable strategy for all cardiac patients. Being a patient's partner in the telerehabilitation program was associated with a heightened sense of security, navigation between active involvement in the rehabilitation process, being an equal partner, and not pushing the patient too hard.",,,,,,"Spindler, Helle/0000-0002-7098-5699; Andreasen, Jan Jesper/0000-0002-2382-3734",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,APR 15,2019,21,4,,,,,,,e13281,10.2196/13281,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/13281,,,,,,,,30985284,,,,,WOS:000465548500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

V.",,,From the individual to the collective: The emergence of a psychological approach to collective memory,APPLIED COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Throughout much of the 20th century, psychologists have largely examined mnemonic processes through an individualistic lens at the expense of social influences. However, this perspective began to change toward the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, when psychologists began to better appreciate the social nature of remembering. In the present paper, we focus on a relatively recent and important evolution of this line of research: the emergence of a psychological approach to collective memory. Using an epidemiological approach to collective memory, we attempt to distil the extant and relevant psychological research and focus on how (collective) memories transmit, converge, and remain stable over time while considering the bidirectional relationship between collective memory and a mnemonic community's identity. We conclude with a discussion of research areas that psychologists should examine moving forward, which will ultimately provide a more holistic understanding of how collective memories emerge, remain stable, and/or change over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0888-4080,1099-0720,,,,JUL,2019,33,4,,,,,504,515,,10.1002/acp.3564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/acp.3564,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000475404200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: The objective of this study was to develop, evaluate, and deploy an automatic natural language processing pipeline to collect user-generated Twitter data as a complementary resource for identifying potential cases of COVID-19 in the United States that are not based on testing and, thus, may not have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Methods: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out reported speech (eg, quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between March 1 and August 21, 2020. Results: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644 (41%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen kappa). A deep neural network classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related to COVID-19, achieved an F-1-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76) for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19. Upon deploying our automatic pipeline, we identified 13,714 tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 and have US state-level geolocations. Conclusions: We have made the 13,714 tweets identified in this study, along with each tweet's time stamp and US state-level geolocation, publicly available to download.

The objective of this study was to describe the evaluation of a multifaceted, evidence-based population health strategy for the reduction of distracted driving. METHODS A multipronged campaign was undertaken from 2014 to 2016 for 16- to 44-year-olds, based on epidemiology, focused on personal stories and consequences, using the Es of injury prevention (epidemiology, education, environment, enforcement, and evaluation). Education consisted of distracted driving videos, informational cards, a social media AdTube campaign, and a movie theater trailer, which were evaluated with a questionnaire regarding CPWD attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Spatial analysis of data within a geographic information system was used to target advertisements. A random sample telephone survey evaluated public awareness of the campaign. Increased CPWD enforcement was undertaken by police services and evaluated by ARIMA time series modeling. RESULTS The AdTube campaign had a view rate of >10% (41,101 views), slightly higher for females. The top performing age group was 18- to 24-year-olds (49%). Our survey found 61% of respondents used handheld CPWD (14% all of the time) with 80% reporting our movie trailer made them think twice about future CPWD. A stakeholder survey and spatial analysis targeted our advertisements in areas of close proximity to high schools, universities, near intersections with previous motor vehicle collisions, high traffic volumes, and population density. A telephone survey revealed that 41% of the respondents were aware of our campaign, 17% from our print and movie theater ads and 3% from social media. Police enforcement campaign blitzes resulted in 160 tickets for CPWD. Following campaign implementation, there was a statistically significant mean decrease of 462 distracted driving citations annually (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION A multifaceted, evidence-based population health strategy using the Es of injury prevention with interdisciplinary collaboration is a comprehensive method to be used for the reduction of distracted driving.",,,,,"Gilliland, Jason/E-3393-2019","Gilliland, Jason/0000-0002-2909-2178; Clark, Andrew/0000-0002-3080-5833",,,,,,,,,,,,,2163-0755,2163-0763,,,,MAR,2021,90,3,,,,,535,543,,10.1097/TA.0000000000002948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TA.0000000000002948,,,,,,,,32976325,,,,,WOS:000625400000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

We shall use a large cohort of applicants for different social programmes to evaluate the effect of BFP receipt on premature all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Methods and analysis We will identify BFP recipients and non-recipients among new applicants from 2004 to 2015 in the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort, a database of 114 million individuals containing sociodemographic and mortality information of applicants to any Brazilian social programme. For individuals applying from 2011, when we have better recorded income data, we shall compare premature (age 30-69) cardiovascular and all-cause mortality among BFP recipients and non-recipients using regression discontinuity design (RDD) with household monthly per capita income as the forcing variable. Effects will be estimated using survival models accounting for individuals follow-up. To test the sensitivity of our findings, we will estimate models with different bandwidths, include potential confounders as covariates in the survival models, and restrict our data to locations with the most reliable data. In addition, we will estimate the effect of BFP on studied outcomes using propensity score risk-set matching, separately for individuals that applied <= 2010 and >2011, allowing comparability with RDD. Analyses will be stratified by geographical region, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position.

Three reviewers analysed all videos using validated criteria for the quality of consumer health information (DISCERN and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool [PEMAT]). High quality was defined as follows: DISCERN >= 4, PEMAT understandability >= 75% and PEMAT actionability >= 75%. A 5-point Likert scale was used to demonstrate the level of misinformation compared to American Urological Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Perceived race and ethnicity of people in the videos were assessed by consensus approach.Results: TK videos were shorter (median 3.7 vs. 0.5 min, p < 0.001) and had more views per month (5437.5 vs. 19.3, p = 0.03) than YT videos. Perceived Black and Hispanic representation was present in 10% and 6% of YT videos and 20% and 12% of TK videos, respectively. High-risk racial/ethnic groups were explicitly discussed in 46% of YT videos and 8% of TK videos. A total of 98% of YT videos and 100% of TK videos had low- to moderate-quality consumer health information, and 88% of YT videos and 100% of TK videos had moderate to high levels of misinformation based on screening guidelines.Conclusions: YT and TK videos about prostate cancer screening are widely viewed but do not provide quality consumer health information. Black and Hispanic men remain under-represented on both platforms, and high-risk racial groups were not discussed in most videos despite the importance for screening criteria.

In the last week, the trailer for a new bombshell documentary Plandemic has been doing the rounds, gaining notoriety for being repeatedly removed from YouTube and Facebook.

However, no studies to date have assessed the feasibility of using these recruitment sources for epidemiological research on ovulation and menstruation. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of recruiting a diverse sample of women to an epidemiological study of ovulation and menstruation (OM) health (OM Global Health Study) using digital recruitment sources. The feasibility and diversity were assessed via click and participation rates, geographic location, BMI, smoking status, and other demographic information. Methods: Participants were actively recruited via in-app messages using the menstrual tracking app Clue (BioWink GmbH) and a boosted Facebook post by DivaCup (Diva International Inc.). Other passive recruitment methods also took place throughout the recruitment period (eg, email communications, blogs, other social media). The proportion of participants who visited the study website after viewing and clicking the hypertext link (click rates) in the in-app messages and boosted Facebook post and the proportion of participants who completed the surveys per the number of completed consent and eligibility screeners (participation rates) were used to quantify the success of recruiting participants to the study website and study survey completion, respectively. Survey completion was defined as finishing the pregnancy and birth history section of the OM Global Health Study questionnaire. Results: The recruitment period was from February 27, 2018, through January 24, 2020. In-app messages and the boosted Facebook post were seen by 104,000 and 21,400 people, respectively. Overall, 215 participants started the OM Global Health Study survey, of which 140 (65.1%), 39 (18.1%), and 36 (16.8%) participants were recruited via the app, the boosted Facebook post, and other passive recruitment methods, respectively. The click rate via the app was 18.9% (19,700 clicks/104,000 ad views) and 1.6% via the boosted Facebook post (340 clicks/21,400 ad views.) The overall participation rate was 44.6% (198/444), and the average participant age was 21.8 (SD 6.1) years. In terms of geographic and racial/ethnic diversity, 91 (44.2%) of the participants resided outside the United States and 147 (70.7%) identified as non-Hispanic White. In-app recruitment produced the most geographically diverse stream, with 44 (32.8%) of the 134 participants in Europe, 77 (57.5%) in North America, and 13 (9.8%) in other parts of the world. Both human error and nonhuman procedural breakdowns occurred during the recruitment process, including a computer programming error related to age eligibility and a hacking attempt by an internet bot. Conclusions: In-app messages using the menstrual tracking app Clue were the most successful method for recruiting participants from many geographic regions and producing the greatest numbers of started and completed surveys. This study demonstrates the utility of digital recruitment to enroll participants from diverse geographic locations and provides some lessons to avoid technical recruitment errors in future digital recruitment strategies for epidemiological research.",,,,,,"Aschengrau, Ann/0000-0001-8153-7712; Rodriguez, Erika/0000-0003-4684-4180; Shea, Amanda Ann/0000-0002-8846-8841; Lane, Kevin/0000-0002-1038-6811; Peer, Komal/0000-0002-9685-4910; de Figueiredo Veiga, Alexis/0000-0003-4761-1311; Williams, Anna/0000-0003-3609-4355",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,SEP,2022,6,9,,,,,,,e39046,10.2196/39046,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/39046,,,,,,,,35969168,,,,,WOS:000904532900048,View Full Record in Web of Science

Preprints are now an essential complement to peer-reviewed publications. Eschewing preprints will slow scientific progress and reduce the public health impact of epidemiologic research. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted long-standing limitations of the peer-review process. Preprint servers, such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, served as crucial venues to rapidly disseminate research and provide detailed backup to sound-bite science that is often communicated through the popular press or social media. The major criticisms of preprints arise from an unjustified optimism about peer review. Peer review provides highly imperfect sorting and curation of research and only modest improvements in research conduct or presentation for most individual papers. The advantages of peer review come at the expense of months to years of delay in sharing research methods or results. For time-sensitive evidence, these delays can lead to important missteps and ill-advised policies. Even with research that is not intrinsically urgent, preprints expedite debate, expand engagement, and accelerate progress. The risk that poor-quality papers will have undue influence because they are posted on a preprint server is low.

For some patients, the pain persists, and one management option is a spinal epidural steroid injection (ESI). The aim of an ESI is to relieve leg pain, improve function and reduce the need for surgery. ESIs work well in some patients but not in others, but we cannot identify these patient subgroups currently. This study aims to identify factors, including patient characteristics, clinical examination and imaging findings, that help in predicting who does well and who does not after an ESI. The overall objective is to develop a prognostic model to support individualised patient and clinical decision-making regarding ESI.MethodsPOiSE is a prospective cohort study of 439 patients with sciatica referred by their clinician for an ESI. Participants will receive weekly text messages until 12 weeks following their ESIand then again at 24 weeks following their ESI to collect data on leg pain severity. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after their ESI to collect data on pain, disability, recovery and additional interventions. The prognosis for the cohort will be described. The primary outcome measure for the prognostic model is leg pain at 6 weeks. Prognostic models will also be developed for secondary outcomes of disability and recovery at 6 weeks and additional interventions at 24 weeks following ESI. Statistical analyses will include multivariable linear and logistic regression with mixed effects model.Ethics and disseminationThe POiSE study has received ethical approval (South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee 21/SC/0257).

Recently, there has been an increasing number of entertainment-education YouTube videos focused on hand hygiene. However, there is currently no understanding about the quality of these videos; therefore, this study aimed to explore the social media content and user engagement with these videos. Methods: The search terms hand hygiene and hand hygiene education were used to query YouTube. Video content had to be directed at a health care professional audience. Using author designed checklists, each video was systematically evaluated and grouped according to educational usefulness and was subsequently evaluated against the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness. Results: A total of 400 videos were screened, with 70 videos retained for analysis. Of these, 55.7%(n = 39) were categorized as educationally useful. Overall, educationally useful videos scored higher than noneducationally useful videos across the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness. Miscommunication of the concept of My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene was observed in several of the YouTube videos. Conclusions: The availability of educationally useful videos in relation to hand hygiene is evident; however, it is clear that there are opportunities for contributors using this medium to strengthen their alignment with social media best practice principles to maximize the effectiveness, reach, and sustainability of their content.

However, there is a lack of population-based evidence on EDs comprising the age range from early adolescence to emerging adulthood as well as considering both females and males equally. Additionally, the differential role of a comprehensive set of several relevant risk factors and particularly weight- and appearance-related discrimination warrants further attention. Thus, we aimed to contribute to a better understanding of sex- and age-related differences in associations between discrimination experience and other relevant personal risk factors (body image, social media use, self-efficacy, social support) with EDs. Furthermore, we were interested in the exploration of underlying mechanisms enhancing the risk of EDs by taking discrimination experience into account. Methods Based on a logistic regression model, we investigated associations between weight- and appearance-related discrimination and EDs while controlling for other relevant personal risk factors in a subsample of N = 8504 adolescents and emerging adults (54.4% female, mean age = 20.71 years, SD = 4.32 years) drawn from a German representative health survey (KiGGS Wave 2). In a second step, we investigated the mediating role of discrimination experience between the other risk factors and EDs with the help of a path model. Results While controlling for other relevant personal risk factors, weight- and appearance-related discrimination was significantly related to EDs. Whereas the risk of EDs was significantly enhanced in males and emerging adults frequently experiencing weight-related discrimination, adolescents showed a higher risk of EDs when experiencing appearance-related discrimination. Moreover, discrimination experience partly explained the associations between body image dissatisfaction, low self-efficacy, high media use and ED symptoms. Conclusions The results highlight weight- and appearance-related discrimination as one central factor to be considered in the pathogeneses of EDs and underpin the need for discrimination prevention as well as the promotion of adaptive coping with discrimination experience to reduce the risk of developing ED symptoms. Males and emerging adults need particular attention when facing weight-related discrimination whereas risk constellations and EDs particularly affecting females need further investigation.",,,,,"Cohrdes, Caroline/ABL-5334-2022","Cohrdes, Caroline/0000-0003-0063-4145",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,SEP 26,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1751,10.1186/s12889-021-11756-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11756-y,,,,,,,,34565379,,,,,WOS:000699914500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods Using R programming language, we collected Turkish Twitter posts containing the terms used for schizophrenia in Turkish through Twitter's Search API over a 47-day period between July and June 2019. After removing retweets, we randomly sampled 3000 tweets and manually categorized them in three dimensions: use type (metaphorical/non-metaphorical), topic and attitude. Qualitative analysis on representative tweets were performed and word frequencies were calculated. Results In total 44,266 tweets were collected and after removing retweets, 24,529 tweets were obtained. Overwhelming majority of the tweets (91.7%) used the terms metaphorically and the majority displayed stigmatizing (68.3%) and trivializing (23%) attitudes. Politics was the most common topic (58.2%) followed by everyday/social chatter (28.5%). Only a small number of tweets were part of awareness campaigns (0.2%) or displayed a supportive attitude (0.8%). Terms were often used metaphorically in a stigmatizing manner as personal or political insults, while in everyday/social contexts, they were used in a trivializing manner to label eccentricity, oddness, overthinking and suspiciousness. Popularity and reach metrics show that these tweets were extensively retweeted, liked and reached millions of users.

Study Design and Setting: An online survey was distributed to authors of observational studies recruited via social media, personal network snowballing, and mass mailings using targeted search strategies. Data on demographics, awareness, motivators, and usage were collected in conjunction with a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) scale on which confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. Results: One thousand fifteen participants completed the survey. Of these, 185 (18.2%) indicated they had never heard of STROBE nor used it previously, 195 (19.2%) had heard of it but never used it, and 635 (62.6%) had used it. Journals promoting STROBE were both key motivators and awareness mechanisms; peers and educational workshops were also important influencing factors to a lesser degree. The internal consistency of the modified UTAUT scale was strong (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). CFA supported a four-factor model with 23 questions.

Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with Diabetes, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for Diet included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for Exercise included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for Obesity included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.",,,,,"Dahl, Alicia/ITV-8301-2023; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle/I-7319-2019; Kharrazi, Hadi/Q-1725-2015; Leung, Wing Yin/HLW-3074-2023","Dahl, Alicia/0000-0002-6229-0926; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle/0000-0002-1683-5729; Kharrazi, Hadi/0000-0003-1481-4323; Karami, Amir/0000-0003-1936-7497",,,,,,,,,,,,,0268-4012,1873-4707,,,,FEB,2018,38,1,,,,,1,6,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000416954500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Participants had to be living/willing to travel to Manchester. Recruitment was in September 2017 and data collection was completed in January 2018.Participants26 participants aged>50 years with self-diagnosed symptomatic knee OA were recruited.Outcome measuresParticipants were provided with a consumer cellular smartwatch with a bespoke app that triggered a series of daily questions including two times per day questions about level of knee pain and one time per month question from the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. The smartwatch also recorded daily step counts.ResultsOf the 25 participants, 13 were men and their mean age was 65 years (standard deviation (SD) 8 years). The smartwatch app was successful in simultaneously assessing and recording data on knee pain and step count in real time. Knee pain was categorised into sustained high/low or fluctuating levels, but there was considerable day-to-day variation within these categories. Levels of knee pain in general correlated with pain assessed by KOOS. Those with sustained high/low levels of pain had a similar daily step count average (mean 3754 (SD 2524)/4307 (SD 2992)), but those with fluctuating pain had much lower step count levels (mean 2064 (SD 1716)).ConclusionsSmartwatches can be used to assess pain and physical activity in knee OA. Larger studies may help inform a better understanding of causal links between physical activity patterns and pain.

While it is challenging to predict specific outbreaks, understanding the factors contributing to Monkeypox's pandemic potential is important. This discussion paper explores the future risks and preparedness measures concerning Monkeypox in Saudi Arabia. The study reviews the past and current knowledge on the Monkeypox outbreak, including its clinical presentation, transmission dynamics (animals-to-humans and humans-to-human), epidemiology, and diagnostic methods. Furthermore, it explores the potential risk factors for the spread of Monkeypox within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, mainly in the Saudi Arabian context, considering factors such as urbanization and travel and trade patterns. The paper emphasizes the importance of early virus detection, surveillance systems, and laboratory capacity in vaccinating and responding to Monkeypox cases. Additionally, it highlights the future risks and preparedness in Saudi Arabia and the usage of social media during the pandemic seeking support and awareness about Monkeypox, and it also highlights the need for effective communication strategies of leaders through social media channels to disseminate accurate information to the public, healthcare providers, and policymakers. The discussion concludes by calling for collaborative efforts among health authorities, researchers, and international medical partners to enhance surveillance, develop outbreak response plans, and ensure the availability of vaccines and treatment options. This research serves as a foundation for guiding future preventive measures and strengthening the overall preparedness of Saudi Arabia in facing the potential emergence of Monkeypox as a future pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,NOV 8,2023,11,,,,,,,,1254545,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1254545,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1254545,,,,,,,,38026424,,,,,WOS:001104850200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such method has been applied to many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO) returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree centrality (72.2%) and density (44.4%). Studies were found to belong to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service providers.

This relationship for vulnerable children and young people has not hitherto been systematically reviewed. This narrative synthesis aims to consolidate research to provide a foundational basis for future health-related social network research and interventions for children and young people. Methods This mixed methods systematic review synthesises research investigating whole, egocentric social networks of 32 vulnerable child groups with a mean age below 18. There were no setting, language or date restrictions. The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 6360 search results, 49 were included for narrative synthesis. Results The majority of pertinent research originates from the USA; the most frequently investigated vulnerabilities were minority ethnic status, homelessness and the presence of special educational needs. Research aims and methodologies varied significantly between studies. Key findings included (i) vulnerable (excluding minority ethnic) children and young people have impoverished networks (ii) access to networks is a protective factor against negative outcomes (iii) social ties, primarily immediate family, provide access to personal resources and (iv) network ties are to a degree substitutable. Conclusions Networks are associated with wellbeing and vulnerable children and young people commonly have impoverished networks, excluding cases where vulnerability classification relates to minority ethnic status. Network embeddedness is associated with positive outcomes, particularly for homeless children. Family are typically primary providers of support, but ties are substitutable when networks are restricted. Egocentric social network research is currently limited for vulnerable child populations.

The goal of this study was to determine whether the informative quality of videos of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV +CPC) is associated with metrics of popularity. METHODS This cross-sectional study used comprehensive search terms to identify videos pertaining to ETV and ETV + CPC presented on the first 3 pages of search results on YouTube. Two pediatric neurosurgeons, 1 neurosurgery resident, and 2 patient families independently reviewed the selected videos. Videos were assessed for overall informational quality by using a validated 5-point Global Quality Score (GQS) and compared to online metrics of popularity and engagement such as views, likes, likes/views ratio, comments/views ratio, and likes/dislikes ratio. Weighted kappa scores were used to measure agreement between video reviewers. RESULTS A total of 58 videos (47 on ETV, 7 on ETV + CPC, 4 on both) of 120 videos assessed met the inclusion criteria. Video styles included technical (62%), lecture (24%), patient testimonial (4%), and other (10%). In terms of GQS, substantial agreement was seen between surgeons (kappa 0.67 [95% CI 0.55, 0.801) and excellent agreement was found between each surgeon and the neurosurgical resident (0.77 [95% CI 0.66, 0.88] and 0.89 [95% CI 0.82, 0.97]). Only fair to moderate agreement was seen between professionals and patient families, with weighted kappa scores ranging from 0.07 to 0.56. Academic lectures were more likely to be rated good or excellent (64% vs 0%, p < 0.001) versus surgical procedure and testimonial video types. There were significant associations between a better GQS and more likes (p = 0.01), views (p = 0.02), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p = 0.016). The likes/views ratio (p = 0.31) and comments/views ratio (p = 0.35) were not associated with GQS. The number of likes (p = 0.02), views (p = 0.03), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p = 0.015) were significantly associated with video style (highest for lecture-style videos). CONCLUSIONS Medical professionals tended to agree when assessing the overall quality of YouTube videos, but this agreement was not as strongly seen when compared to parental ratings. The online metrics of likes, views, and likes/dislikes ratio appear to predict quality. Neurosurgeons seeking to increase their online footprint via YouTube would be well advised to focus more on the academic lecture style because these were universally better rated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1933-0707,1933-0715,,,,JUN,2020,25,6,,,,,607,614,,10.3171/2019.12.PEDS19523,http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2019.12.PEDS19523,,,,,,,,32114541,,,,,WOS:000577124700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite rapid methodological advances, how to effectively and efficiently estimate the parameters of spatial dynamic panel models remains a challenging problem. To tackle this problem, we construct consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model.

NLP techniques have been implemented to analyse large volumes of text from social media platforms to gain insights on disease symptoms, understand barriers to care and predict disease outbreaks. However, AI-based decisions may contain biases that could misrepresent populations, skew results or lead to errors. Bias, within the scope of this paper, is described as the difference between the predictive values and true values within the modelling of an algorithm. Bias within algorithms may lead to inaccurate healthcare outcomes and exacerbate health disparities when results derived from these biased algorithms are applied to health interventions. Researchers who implement these algorithms must consider when and how bias may arise. This paper explores algorithmic biases as a result of data collection, labelling and modelling of NLP algorithms. Researchers have a role in ensuring that efforts towards combating bias are enforced, especially when drawing health conclusions derived from social media posts that are linguistically diverse.

Networks are a common abstraction in these applications for representing complex relationships. Typically, these networks are dynamic-, i.e., they evolve over time. A number of methods have been proposed for anomaly detection in such dynamic network data sets, which are primarily based on changes in network properties. We provide a survey of the various formulations of anomaly detection in dynamic networks with a focus on window-based methods. Window-based methods first define a time window of past network snapshots to model normal behavior and then mark a snapshot as anomalous if it has significantly different patterns from those observed in the time window. We describe two classes of techniques: 1) generalizations of Steiner connectivity; and 2) dense subgraph mining. Both have been used extensively in window-based graph anomaly detection.

Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms.

Most deployed systems employ approaches that rely on simple keyword matching and do not distinguish between relevant and irrelevant keyword mentions making them susceptible to false positives as a result of the fact that keyword volume can be influenced by several social phenomena that may be unrelated to disease occurrence. Furthermore, most solutions are intended for a single language and those meant for multilingual scenarios do not incorporate semantic context. In this paper we experimentally examine different approaches for classifying text for epidemiological surveillance on the social web in addition we offer a systematic comparison of the impact of different input representations on performance. Specifically we compare continuous representations against one-hot encoding for word-based, class-based (ontology-based) and subword units in the form of byte pair encodings.

Methods Using Monitoring the Future data (N = 1244 young adults, modal age: 19, Fall 2020 supplement), we examined internalizing symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 separately), dividing the sample into those without clinically significant scores, significant scores but minimal pandemic-attributed symptoms, and significant scores with substantial pandemic-attributed symptoms. Logistic regression analyses linked demographic factors, pandemic-related experiences, and coping methods to symptom groups. Results Internalizing symptoms were highly prevalent, with many occurring among a majority at least several days over the past 2 weeks. Major changes in education, employment, and resource availability predicted elevated symptom risk (e.g., lacking a place to sleep or money for rent, gas, or food led to 4.43 [95% confidence interval: 2.59-7.55] times the risk of high depressive symptoms significantly attributed to the pandemic). High internalizing symptoms were linked to underutilization of healthy coping behaviors, substance use overutilization, and dietary changes. High depressive and anxious symptoms attributed to the pandemic were marked by high levels of taking breaks from the news/social media and contacting healthcare providers. Conclusions The pandemic's associations with young adults' depressive and anxious symptoms warrants urgent attention through improved mental health treatment infrastructure and stronger structural support.",,,,,"Walther, Cordula/HNI-7449-2023","Kreski, Noah/0000-0003-3725-156X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1091-4269,1520-6394,,,,2022 JUN,2022,39,6,,,,,536,547,,10.1002/da.23273,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/da.23273,,MAY 2022,,,,,,35621201,,,,,WOS:000800546100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the impact of collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought to examine the association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults. METHODS: From the prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who were aged >= 60 years or were married to those aged >= 60 years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups separate from the major social group were defined as group-level-segregated. The CVH score was calculated as the number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and CVH. RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years; 60.0% female), 108 (20.5%) were segregated at baseline. In the cross-sectional analysis, group-level segregation was significantly associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at baseline after adjusting for socio-demographic factors and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.95). Among 274 participants who completed an 8-year follow-up, group-level segregation at baseline was marginally associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse CVH.

Longitudinal studies facilitate estimation of EBF duration, but often suffer from loss to follow-up and missing information. The study estimates the prevalence of EBF, duration and predictors of EBF duration while adjusting for missing data using multiple imputation (MI). Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted on all women giving birth between September 2009-February 2010 in selected hospitals (N=2119). Data on EBF and socio-demographic and other characteristics were collected at birth, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. Information on EBF status and duration was missing for 29%. To deal with missing data, we generated multiple datasets using logistic regression-based MI to impute missing EBF practice, and an accelerated failure time (AFT) model to impute missing duration of EBF. The latter model also identified factors associated with EBF duration. Results: The observed 64% of women practicing EBF (95% CI; 62%-66%) was adjusted, after imputation, to 62% (95% CI; 60%-65%). After imputation, the estimated median time of EBF among women practicing EBF was 4.9 months. Predictors of EBF duration were stated intention to breastfeed, religious observance, and giving formula milk while in hospital. Conclusion: Adjusting estimates of EBF practice and duration using MI is feasible and potentially important. Using an AFT model for EBF duration enables the execution of MI in such studies and allows direct interpretation of the impact of various factors on EBF duration.",,,,,"Hayek, Samah/GRR-3582-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2282-2305,2282-0930,,,,,2019,16,1,,,,,,,e13008,10.2427/13008,http://dx.doi.org/10.2427/13008,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000461994400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Neisseria meningitidis is carried in the pharynx, with adolescents having the highest rates of carriage. A vaccine designed to offer protection against serogroup B (4CMenB) is licensed in Australia. The SA MenB vaccine carriage study aims to assess the impact of 4CMenB on carriage of N. meningitidis in adolescents. Methods and analysis This is a parallel cluster randomised controlled trial enrolling year 10, 11 and 12 school students (approximately 16-18 years of age) throughout SA, in metropolitan and rural/remote areas. Schools are randomised to intervention (4CMenB vaccination at baseline) or control (4CMenB vaccination at study completion) with randomisation stratified by school size and socioeconomic status, as measured by the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (Australian Curriculum). Oropharyngeal swabs will be taken from all students at visit 1, and 12 months later from year 11 and 12 students. Students unvaccinated in 2017 will receive vaccine at the 12-month follow-up. Carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis will be determined by PCR at baseline and 12 months following 4CMenB vaccination and compared with carriage prevalence at 12 months in unvaccinated students. A questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 12 months to assess risk factors associated with carriage. The primary outcome of carriage prevalence of disease causing N. meningitidis at 12 months will be compared between groups using logistic regression, with generalised estimating equations used to account for clustering at the school level.

The magnitude of a potential outbreak, and the impact of disease prevention and control strategies, can be estimated using simulation modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the potential spread of equine influenza in a network of horses associated with a 2-day equestrian show in Ontario, Canada; and (2) determine the effectiveness of several interventions during a simulated outbreak. A discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic agent-based simulation model was constructed to represent horses associated with the show, including those in attendance at the show, and those that were not in attendance but co-boarded with attending horses at their home facilities. At the beginning of each simulation run, one random horse in attendance at the show was infected with equine influenza. In the absence of interventions, the median attack rate was 0.029 (IQR: 0.016-0.056; mean: 0.043; 95% CI: 0.040-0.044) and the average outbreak duration was 19.58 days (95% CI: 19.31-19.85). The most effective intervention was the implementation of either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period, which both resulted in the same median attack rate of 0.0026 (IQR 0.0013-0.0039), although the mean attack rates differed (mean: 0.0043, 95% CI: 0.0039-0.0046; and mean: 0.0029, 95% CI: 0.0028-0.0029; respectively). In instances where implementing either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period would not be feasible, quarantine for shorter time periods was effective when combined with targeted increases in initial facility-level vaccine coverage. The combined implementation of a 2-day quarantine period and an increased vaccine coverage of 75% in facilities with four or more owners resulted in a median attack rate of 0.013 (IQR: 0.0052-0.026; mean: 0.022; 95% CI: 0.020-0.024).

Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. Methods We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. Results 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic.

We will include any study using Jadad (1997) or another method to assess discordance. The first 30 studies screened at the full-text stage by two independent reviewers will be included. We will replicate the authors' Jadad assessments. We will compare our outcomes qualitatively and evaluate the differences between our Jadad assessment of discordance and the authors' assessment. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval was required as no human subjects were involved. In addition to publishing in an open-access journal, we will disseminate evidence summaries through formal and informal conferences, academic websites, and across social media platforms. This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate and replicate Jadad algorithm assessments of discordance across multiple SRs.",,,,,"Ferri, Nicola/HDN-5156-2022; Thabet, Pierre/GRS-0558-2022; Ferri, Nicola/ABC-3776-2020; Tasnim, Sara/HKH-3324-2023; Tricco, Andrea C/B-9920-2011","Ferri, Nicola/0000-0002-8563-9967; Thabet, Pierre/0000-0002-4584-0228; Ferri, Nicola/0000-0002-8563-9967; Tricco, Andrea C/0000-0002-4114-8971; /0000-0002-3311-9804; Tasnim, Sara/0009-0002-4217-2575",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,APR,2022,12,4,,,,,,,e054223,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054223,,,,,,,,35443948,,,,,WOS:000784798300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Retrospective study,SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for one million deaths annually. Greater understanding of the causal risk factors is needed, especially in large urban centers. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the epidemiological profile and temporal trend of suicides over two decades and correlate prevalence with social indicators. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive population-based longitudinal retrospective study conducted in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A temporal trend series for suicide mortality in this city was constructed based on data from the Ministry of Health's mortality notification system, covering 2000-2017. It was analyzed using classic demographic variables relating to social factors. RESULTS: Suicide rates were high throughout this period, increasing from 4.6/100,000 inhabitants in the 2000s to 4.9/100,000 in 2017 (mean: 4.7/100,000). The increase in mortality was mainly due to increased male suicide, which went from 6.0/100,000 to the current 8.0/100,000. Other higher coefficients corresponded to social risk factors, such as being a young adult (25-44 years old), being more educated (eight years of schooling) and having white ethnicity (67.2%). Suicide was also twice as likely to occur at home (47.8%). CONCLUSION: High suicide rates were seen over the period 2000-2017, especially among young adults and males. High schooling levels and white ethnicity were risk factors. The home environment is the crucial arena for preventive action. One special aspect of primary prevention is the internet and especially social media, which provides a multitude of information for suicide prevention.",,,,,"Juliano, Yára/AAQ-3043-2020; Ribeiro, Ana Paula/J-6368-2013; Novo, Neil/AAP-8238-2020; Colombo-Souza, Patricia/G-2288-2014","Ribeiro, Ana Paula/0000-0002-1061-3789; Colombo-Souza, Patricia/0000-0003-0247-4245",,,,,,,,,,,,,1516-3180,,,,,MAY-JUN,2020,138,3,,,,,253,258,,10.1590/1516-3180.2019.0539.R1.05032020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2019.0539.R1.05032020,,,,,,,,32578744,,,,,WOS:000551693500012,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Sandifer, PA",,,,"Sandifer, Paul A.",,,Linking coastal environmental and health observations for human wellbeing,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coastal areas have long been attractive places to live, work, and recreate and remain so even in the face of growing threats from global environmental change. At any moment, a significant portion of the human population is exposed to both positive and negative health effects associated with coastal locations. Some locations may be hotspots of concern for human health due to ongoing climatic and other changes, accentuating the need for better understanding of coastal environment-human health linkages. This paper describes how environmental and health data could be combined to create a coastal environmental and human health observing system. While largely based on information from the US and Europe, the concept should be relevant to almost any coastal area. If implemented, a coastal health observing system would connect a variety of human health data and environmental observations for individuals and communities, and where possible cohorts. Health data would be derived from questionnaires and other personal sources, clinical examinations, electronic health records, wearable devices, and syndromic surveillance, plus information on vulnerability and health-relevant community characteristics, and social media observations. Environmental data sources would include weather and climate, beach and coastal conditions, sentinel species, occurrences of harmful organisms and substances, seafood safety advisories, and distribution, proximity, and characteristics of health-promoting green and blue spaces. Where available, information on supporting resources could be added. Establishment of a linked network of coastal health observatories could provide powerful tools for understanding the positive and negative health effects of coastal living, lead to better health protections and enhanced wellbeing, and provide significant benefits to coastal residents, including the historically disadvantaged, as well as the military, hospitals and emergency departments, academic medical, public health, and environmental health programs, and others.

After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI. Methods and analysis RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors.

DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were consistently used and the same psychiatrist was responsible for the final diagnostic decision. Incidence rates (IRs) were calculated for: the total population (all ages), females overall, and females per 5-year age category. Time trends in IRs were analyzed using JoinPoint regression analyses.ResultsIn four decades, the incidence of AN among 10- to 14-year-old females increased significantly from 8.6 to 38.6 per 100,000 person-years (average period percentage change [APPC] = 56.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.5-130.6. The overall incidence of AN was stable, with IRs ranging from 6.0 (95% CI = 4.3-8.1) to 8.4 (95% CI = 6.4-10.8). The IR of BN decreased significantly from 8.7 (95% CI = 6.7-11.0) to 3.2 (95% CI = 2.0-4.9) in the 2000s, before leveling off in the 2010s (IR 3.2; 95% CI = 2.0-4.8).DiscussionThe incidence of AN among 10- to 14-year-old girls increased significantly over four decades. Both biological and sociocultural factors, for example, early pubertal timing and the impact of social media, might explain this. In other age groups and overall, the incidence of AN remained stable. The significant decrease of the incidence of BN in the previous decades halted in the last decade.Public SignificanceAn important finding of the present study is that for 10- to 14-year-old girls, the risk for developing anorexia nervosa has increased significantly over 40 years. More healthcare facilities for younger people are needed, and prevention programs could include social media use. For bulimia nervosa, the general decrease in the occurrence of new cases has halted in the 2010s.",,,,,,"van Hoeken, Daphne/0000-0003-2956-059X; van Eeden, Annelies/0000-0002-7847-296X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0276-3478,1098-108X,,,,2023 DEC,2023,56,12,,,,,2295,2303,,10.1002/eat.24064,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.24064,,SEP 2023,,,,,,37773004,,,,,WOS:001075102400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the ambiguous nature of how pain is described in text, it presents a unique natural language processing (NLP) challenge. Understanding how pain is described in text and utilizing this knowledge to improve NLP tasks would be of substantial clinical importance. Not much work has previously been done in this space. For this reason, and in order to develop an English lexicon for use in NLP applications, an exploration of pain concepts within free text was conducted. The exploratory text sources included two hospital databases, a social media platform (Twitter), and an online community (Reddit). This exploration helped select appropriate sources and inform the construction of a pain lexicon. The terms within the final lexicon were derived from three sources-literature, ontologies, and word embedding models. This lexicon was validated by two clinicians as well as compared to an existing 26-term pain sub-ontology and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. The final validated lexicon consists of 382 terms and will be used in downstream NLP tasks by helping select appropriate pain-related documents from electronic health record (EHR) databases, as well as pre-annotating these words to help in development of an NLP application for classification of mentions of pain within the documents.

Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation.

Cannabis vaping is an emerging issue, and it is unknown whether the patterning and correlates of early-onset cannabis vaping differ from those of cannabis smoking.Methods: We used repeat cross-sectional data from a nationally representative biennial survey (2012-2018) of students aged 14-15 years in New Zealand (N = 11,405), response rate 65% (2012), 64% (2014-2016) and 59% (2018).Results: Between 2012 and 2018 lifetime cannabis use decreased, but regular use (past month, weekly, daily) was stable. Prevalence of past month, weekly and daily use in 2016-2018 (pooled) was 8.6%, 3.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Cannabis vaping was reported by 24% of past month cannabis users. The demographic profile of early-onset cannabis smokers and vapers was similar, with elevated use of both modes among Maori (Indigenous), same- or both-sex attracted students and those in low decile (high-deprivation) schools. Correlates were similar for both modes. Cannabis use was strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol use. The next strongest associations (after adjustment) were exposure to second-hand smoke at home, student income >$50/week and low parental monitoring of whereabouts. Past week social media use, psychological distress and low parental monitoring of spending were also associated with both modes.Discussion and conclusions: Early-onset cannabis use is much higher in structurally disadvantaged groups, and among those who use tobacco and alcohol. Comprehensive multisubstance approaches to prevention are indicated in this age group. Efforts to reduce socio-economic inequity and exposure to other risk factors may reduce cannabis-related harm.",,,,,"Hammond, David/JPW-9267-2023; Edwards, Richard/JAX-3732-2023","Ball, Jude/0000-0002-4717-5495",,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-5236,1465-3362,,,,2023 JAN 16,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/dar.13597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dar.13597,,JAN 2023,,,,,,36645714,,,,,WOS:000916698600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, oral diseases are rarely considered as a health priority and evidence-informed policy generation is challenging. Science communication and health advocacy are critical in that respect. However, due to time limitations, research workload and other factors, academics are usually hindered from participating in such lengthy endeavours. Here, we make the case that 'science communication and health advocacy task forces' should be a priority at academic institutions. The two main duties of these task forces are knowledge transfer about the burden of oral conditions and patterns of inequalities, and their underlying social and commercial determinants, and advocacy and mediation between the stakeholders involved directly or indirectly in policy making. These interdisciplinary task forces, including both academics and non-academics, should collectively have skills that include (1) knowledge about oral health, dental public health and epidemiology, (2) ability to communicate clearly and coherently and make the case in both lay and scientific language terms, (3) familiarity with digital and social media platforms and ability to create visual aids, videos and documentaries, (4) good negotiation skills and (5) maintaining scientific transparency and avoiding getting involved in confrontation with political parties.

In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. Objectives: In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, 'mental health', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled. Results: The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India.

While global, broad-based research is being conducted, little is known about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and well-being or how protective and resilience factors influence the human response in Australian rural and regional communities. Rural and regional communities often have less resources to deal with such public health emergencies and face additional environmental adversity. Healthcare workers, including those in rural and regional areas, have felt the immediate impacts of COVID-19 in a multitude of ways and these impacts will continue for years to come. Therefore, this study aims to describe and understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rural and regional healthcare workforce within the Loddon Mallee region, Victoria, Australia. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort of rural and regional healthcare workers will be recruited and followed over 3 years to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health and well-being. Self-administered online questionnaires will be administered every 6 months for a 36-month period. Multiple outcomes will be assessed; however, the primary outcomes are emotional health and well-being and psychological resilience. Emotional health and well-being will be measured using validated instruments that will assess multiple domains of the emotional health and well-being continuum. Linear and logistic regression and latent growth curve modelling will be used to examine the association between baseline and follow-up participant emotional health, well-being and resilience while adjusting for potentially time-varying confounding variables. Participant characteristics measured at baseline will also be tested for association with incident health, morbidity, mortality and health service utilisation outcomes at follow-up.

We aimed to assess HIV-testing behaviour and associated factors in MSM by urbanisation of place of residence. Design Data were derived from online survey ('Men & Sexuality') in the Netherlands, which was mainly advertised on social media (Facebook and Instagram), dating websites, apps for MSM (Grindr and PlanetRomeo) and gay media. Primary and secondary outcome measures HIV testing was defined as recent (<1 year), not recent (>= 1 year) or never. Using multinominal regression analyses, factors associated with not recent testing and never testing, compared with recent testing, were assessed among MSM living in highly (>2500 residences/km(2)) or non-highly (<= 2500 residences/km(2)) urbanised areas. Participants The study sample included 3815 MSM, currently living in the Netherlands. The mean age was 36 years (SD 14.7), and 67.6% were highly educated. Results In highly urbanised areas, 11.8% was never and 19.8% was not recently HIV-tested. In non-highly urbanised areas, this was 25.2% and 19.6%. Among MSM living in highly urbanised areas, independently associated with never and not recent testing were younger age, self-identification as bisexual, fewer sex partners, never notified of HIV and no recent condomless anal intercourse. Among MSM living in non-highly urbanised areas, lower perceived HIV severity, higher perceived HIV risk and a lower proportion gay friends were associated with never and not recent testing. Among never tested MSM, those in non-highly urbanised areas preferred self-sampling/self-testing over facility-based testing; those in highly urbanised areas preferred testing at healthcare facilities. Conclusions The proportion of never tested MSM was high (25%) in non-highly urbanised areas in the Netherlands. MSM living in non-highly urbanised areas may possibly be reached with targeted approaches to increase HIV testing uptake such as self-testing/self-sampling strategies.",,,,,"Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole/M-7178-2014","den Daas, Chantal/0000-0003-0955-3691",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,JAN,2022,12,1,,,,,,,e049175,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049175,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049175,,,,,,,,35027414,,,,,WOS:000743675300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design Nationwide, cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey. Setting 56 randomly selected communities in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone. Participants 1253 adults aged 18 years and older of which 52% were men. Main outcome measures We calculated proportions of core indicators (awareness, knowledge, risk perception, practices). A composite variable for knowledge (based on seven variables) was created, and categorised into low (0-2 correct), medium (3-4) and high (5-7). Predictors of knowledge were analysed with multilevel ordinal regression models. Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression models. Results We found that 75% of the respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A majority (70%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared with 61% of men. 60% of men and 54% of women had already taken action to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap and water (87%). Radio (73%) was the most used source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (39%). Having a medium or high level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.3).

However, the prevalence of physical inactivity, which is considered a key modifiable driver of childhood obesity, has reached alarming levels among European youth. There is a need to update the data for Spain, in order to establish if current measures are effective or new approaches are needed. Methods and analysis We present the protocol for Physical Activity, Sedentarism, lifestyles and Obesity in Spanish youth (PASOS). This observational, nationally representative, multicentre study aims to determine the PA levels, sedentary behaviours and prevalence of physical inactivity (defined as <60 min of moderate to vigorous PA per day) in a representative sample of Spanish children and adolescents. The PASOS study has recruited a representative random sample of children and adolescents aged 8-16 years from 242 educational centres in the 17 'autonomous regions' into which Spain is divided. The aim is to include a total of 4508 youth participants and their families. Weight, height and waist circumference will be measured by standardised procedures. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, quality of life, sleep duration, PA and sedentary behaviour are being measured by validated questionnaires. PA is measured by the Physical Activity Unit 7-item Screener. A representative subsample (10% of participants) was randomly selected to wear accelerometers for 9 days to obtain objective data on PA. Parents are asked about their educational level, time spent doing PA, diet quality, self-perceived stress, smoking habit, weight, height, their child's birth weight and if the child was breast fed.

However, its prevalence in the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains unclear. We aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of dizziness in a large sample of the Saudi population. MethodsIn this is cross-sectional study, we used an electronic survey, which was completed by 1.478 respondents, with a response rate of 84% across five regions of Saudi Arabia. The online survey was launched on the Qualtrics website and distributed via social media channels to obtain heterogeneous responses. The study included adults aged >= 18 years who resided in Saudi Arabia during data collection. We used t-test and chi-square test for descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression model to assess prevalence and predictors of dizziness. ResultsMore than half of the participants were aged between 26 years and 45 years (58.66%). Of the participants, 42.97% reported having dizziness at the time of taking the survey. Women were less likely than men to report dizziness (OR = 0.65; CI, 0.49, 0.87; p = 0.003). A description of the type of dizziness by age revealed that vertigo slightly decreased with age. Unclear vision with movement or blurry vision was common in young adults, whereas imbalance was common in older adults. A multiple regression model adjusted for demographic characteristics revealed a statistically significant association between dizziness and age group. Participants in the age group of 46-55 years were 1.83 times more likely to report dizziness compared to those aged >65 years (odds ratio = 1.83; confidence interval, 0.62, 5.41; p = 0.0009).

Design A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had self-isolated due to COVID-19. Setting University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK (UHBFT). Participants 956 healthcare workers were recruited by open invitation via UHBFT trust email and social media between 27 April 2020 and the 8 June 2020. Intervention Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of their original illness and ethnodemographic variables. Results Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG, IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2% (n=442/956). The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3%, 18.7% and 8.1% for IgG, IgA and IgM, respectively. IgGAM identified serological responses in 40.6% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a positive predictive value of 92.3% for seropositivity in self-isolating individuals a time when Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 was predominant. Conclusions and relevance Assays employing combined antibody detection demonstrate enhanced seroepidemiological sensitivity and can detect prior viral exposure even when PCR swabs have been negative.

Data from Twitter could be used to better understand the interest in and perceptions of a variety of diseases and medical conditions, including rheumatological diseases which have increased in prevalence over the past several decades. The aim of this study was to perform a content analysis of tweets referring to rheumatological diseases. Methods: The content of each tweet was rated as medical (including a reference to diagnosis, treatment, or other aspects of the disease) or non-medical (such as requesting help). The type of user and the suitability of the medical content (appropriate content or, on the contrary, fake content if it was medically inappropriate according to the current medical knowledge) were also evaluated. The number of retweets and likes generated were also investigated. Results: We analyzed a total of 1514 tweets: 1093 classified as medical and 421 as non-medical. The diseases with more tweets were the most prevalent. Within the medical tweets, the content of these varied according to the disease (some more focused on diagnosis and others on treatment). The fake content came from unidentified users and mostly referred to the treatment of diseases. Conclusions: According to our results, the analysis of content posted on Twitter in regard to rheumatological diseases may be useful for investigating the public's prevailing areas of interest, concerns and opinions.

The purpose of this investigation was to identify characteristics associated with HBV knowledge in this disproportionately affected population. Methods: A cross-sectional, multilingual survey study using convenience sampling was conducted in a Midwestern urban city to collect information on respondents' demographics, health care access, and HBV knowledge. Hepatitis B virus knowledge was categorized into epidemiology, natural history, transmission, and vaccination. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. Results: Of the 174 individuals who completed surveys, 139 (79.9%) were Asian. Characteristics of univariate analyses associated with higher knowledge scores included younger age (18-49 years), proficiency in reading English, college education, current employment status, physician using preferred language, last physician's visit in 2018 or prior, perceived lack of time to see a physician, use of emergency department, prior HBV vaccination, prior HBV testing, higher level of self-reported knowledge about HBV, and acquiring health information from the Internet, messaging applications, friends, and family (P < .05). In the multivariable analysis, shorter residency in the United States (0-10 years), current employment status, having heard of HBV, and confidence in their HBV knowledge were associated with higher knowledge scores.

Methods: We collected self-reported health information from an Internet-based sample of adults residing within the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in 2017. We created Bayesian hierarchical models with three sets of predictor variables for each of six common health behaviors and outcomes, with results poststratified using the American Community Survey to estimate region and ZIP Code Tabulation Area -level prevalence. Results: When comparing MRP estimates with a population-based sample as a reference, we found that adjustment using MRP can reduce bias in prevalence estimates and provide estimates for local area prevalence. 14 of 18 adjusted estimates were closer to the benchmark than the unadjusted estimates and MRP using all three covariate sets resulted in better overall agreement with the benchmark compared with the unadjusted estimates. Conclusions: MRP can improve prevalence estimates from self-selected Internet-based samples, although a nonnegligible amount of bias may remain. Illustrating the utility and limitations of this method will help researchers develop relevant estimates of the local public health burden, helping local health officials better understand and reduce poor health outcomes.

This article provides practical guidance on using social media data for measuring public sentiment.Methods:We describe the main steps of such research, including data collection, data cleaning, binary sentiment analysis, and visualization of findings. We randomly sampled 55,844,310 publicly available tweets from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2021 using Twitter's Application Programming Interface. We restricted analyses to US tweets in English using one or more 90 race-related keywords. We used a Support Vector Machine, a supervised machine learning model, for sentiment analysis.Results:The proportion of tweets referencing racially minoritized groups that were negative increased at the county, state, and national levels, with a 16.5% increase at the national level from 2011 to 2021. Tweets referencing Black and Middle Eastern people consistently had the highest proportion of negative sentiment compared with all other groups. Stratifying temporal trends by racial and ethnic groups revealed unique patterns reflecting historical events specific to each group, such as the killing of George Floyd regarding sentiment of posts referencing Black people, discussions of the border crisis near the 2018 midterm elections and anti-Latinx sentiment, and the emergence of COVID-19 and anti-Asian sentiment.Conclusions:This study demonstrates the utility of social media data as a quantitative means to measure racial sentiment over time and place.

While our ability to study environment and health associations across countries and continents grows, data protection rules and greater patient control over the use of their data present new challenges to using health data in research. Innovative tools that circumvent the need for the physical sharing of data by supporting non-disclosive sharing of information, or that permit spatial analysis without researchers needing access to underlying patient data can be used to support analyses while protecting data confidentiality. User-friendly visualizations, allowing small-area data to be seen and understood by non-expert audiences, are revolutionizing public and researcher interactions with data.

Yet, the postnatal environment may affect the risk of ASD as well. Objective: To determine whether a set of five postnatal variables are associated with ASD. These variables are: acetaminophen exposure, antibiotic exposure, incidence of ear infection, decreased duration of breastfeeding, and decreased consumption of oral vitamin D drops. Materials and methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted. Participants were parents living in the USA with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years of age. Potential participants were informed about the survey via postings on social media, websites, and listservs and were offered an opportunity to participate in a raffle as well. Participants were also recruited through the Interactive Autism Network. Results: There were 1,741 completed survey responses. After exclusions, there remained 1,001 responses associated with children with ASD (cases) and 514 responses associated with children who do not have ASD (controls). In this data set, doses of postnatal acetaminophen (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.016, CI: 1.003-1.032, .0.026), courses of postnatal antibiotics (aOR 1.103, CI: 1.046-1.168, p<0.001), incidence of postnatal ear infection (aOR 1.137, Cl: 1.046-1 .236, p=0.003), and decreased duration of breastfeeding (aOR 0.948, CI: 0.932-0.965, p<0.001) are all associated with ASD when adjusted for eight demographic variables. A weak association between oral vitamin D drop exposure and ASD was also found when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics (aOR 1.025, CI: 0.995-1.056,p=0.102). Conclusion: This study adds to evidence that postnatal acetaminophen use, postnatal antibiotic use, incidence of ear infection, and early weaning are associated with an increased risk of ASD. It also finds that postnatal oral vitamin D drops are weakly associated with ASD when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics.",,,,,,"Bell, Kathleen/0000-0003-0452-8139; Bittker, Seth/0000-0002-1942-3914",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1178-2021,,,,,2018,14,,,,,,1399,1414,,10.2147/NDT.S158811,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S158811,,,,,,,,29910617,,,,,WOS:000434035000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods and analysis This cross-sectional study was designed to collect a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18-65 years; estimated start/end-June/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics. For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance and regression analyses.

Substantial literature demonstrates that existential and spiritual well-being has positive effects on health. While people turn to existential and spiritual orientations and practices during ageing, struggle with illness and approaching death, patients with severe illnesses like, for example, cancer similarly experience existential and spiritual needs. These needs are often unmet in secular societies leading to spiritual pain, unnecessary suffering, worse quality of life and higher medical costs of care. Methods and analysis EXICODE is a national cohort comprising a 10% random sample of the adult Danish population with individual-level register and survey data. Specific patient subgroups are oversampled to ensure diseased respondents. The questionnaire used in the survey consists of a collection of validated instruments on existential and spiritual constructs suited for secular culture as well as some ad hoc questions compiled in the comprehensive EXICODE Questionnaire. Ethics and dissemination The project is registered for legal and GDPR concerns by the University of Southern Denmark, journal number: 10.367. Ethical approval was not required by Danish law since EXICODE collects only interview, survey and register data, but due to institutional best-practice policy an ethical evaluation and approval were nevertheless obtained from the University of Southern Denmark Research Ethics Committee (institutional review board), journal number: 20/39546.

We identify factors indicating COVID-19 positivity in non-hospitalized patients and prognosticators of moderate-to-severe disease. Methods: Appeals conducted in April-June 2020 in social media, collaborating medical societies and patient advocacy groups recruited 20,476 participants >= 18 years who believed they had COVID-19 exposure. Volunteers consented on-line and reported height, weight, concomitant illnesses, medication and supplement use, residential, occupational or community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2279 reported a COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1414 negative (COVID-). Results: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever best distinguished COVID+ from COVID-participants (OR 6.07, 95% CI: 4.39 to 8.47). COVID + subjects with BMI>30, concomitant respiratory disorders or an organ transplant had increased risk of moderate-to- severe dyspnoea. Race and anti-autoimmunity medication did not affect moderate-to-severe dyspnea risk. Conclusions: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever differentiates COVID-19.

How it may be longitudinally associated with depressive symptoms and functioning, and with daily momentary affect, remains to be investigated. A total of 3,033 young people were consecutively recruited from a large-scale epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong Kong. A subsample (n = 936) was followed-up after 1 year, with experience sampling data collected from 177 participants. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were applied to examine the prospective associations between smartphone overuse and depressive symptoms, with multilevel models fitted to examine its associations with momentary affect. The prevalence of smartphone overuse in the Hong Kong youth population was 29.3%. Smartphone overuse was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms and functional impairments both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The associations between smartphone overuse and 1-year depressive symptoms were significant, even when accounting for baseline symptoms, social media use, and other risk and protective factors. Baseline depressive symptoms, in contrast, were not associated with 1-year smartphone overuse after adjusting for baseline smartphone overuse. Smartphone overuse was also significantly associated with higher levels of momentary negative affect, even when accounting for depressive symptoms.

However, whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated with future hallucinatory experiences. Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50% higher, and bully-victims had a 89% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory experiences three years later than children who were not involved in bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim = 1.89, 95% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks, but not peer acceptance networks, were associated with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection = 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024). Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory experiences in pre-adolescence.

It provides a massive amount of data for real-time monitoring of infectious diseases (such as COVID-19) and freeing disease-prevention organizations from the tedious labor involved in public health surveillance. Personal health mention (PHM) detection is one of the critical methods to keep up-to-date on an epidemic's condition; it attempts to identify a person's health condition based on online text information. This paper explores PHM identification for COVID-19 through Twitter. We built a COVID-19 PHM data set containing tweets annotated with four types of COVID-19-related health conditions. A masked attention model was devised to classify the tweets as self-mention, other-mention, awareness, and non-health. We obtained promising results on the PHM identification task. The classification results facilitate timely health monitoring and surveillance for digital epidemiology.

These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (similar to 94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.",,,,,"Alvarez, Julio/H-8292-2013; Pozo, Pilar/O-1728-2018; Pozo, Pilar/CAG-1393-2022; Grisi-Filho, Jose/J-2523-2012","Alvarez, Julio/0000-0002-8999-9417; Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873; Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873; Grisi-Filho, Jose/0000-0002-3263-2147; Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2607,,,,FEB,2021,9,2,,,,,,,227,10.3390/microorganisms9020227,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9020227,,,,,,,,33499225,,,,,WOS:000622821000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It aims to assess vaccination perceptions and evaluate the willingness to pay for the vaccine among Belarusian HCPs, thereby enhancing pandemic preparedness. Methods: in October 2022, a cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted among Belarusian HCPs using a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ). Invitations were disseminated via social media platforms using a snowball sampling method. The SAQ encompassed various categories, including sociodemographic details, medical history, sources of mpox information, perceived and factual mpox knowledge, and perceptions of the mpox vaccine according to the health belief model (HBM), mpox vaccine acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP). Results: while a large proportion of respondents had good knowledge of mpox epidemiology and its clinical manifestations, their awareness of available vaccines and treatment options was limited. Consequently, a significant correlation was found between the history of influenza vaccination and mpox-related knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed that just over half of the participants (51.4%) were willing to receive the mpox vaccine if offered for free, safely, and effectively, with their decision largely influenced by perceived benefits (Spearman's rho = 0.451) and cues to action (Spearman's rho = 0.349). However, a considerable degree of hesitancy (30.6%) and resistance (18.1%) towards the mpox vaccine was observed, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to address these issues. Conclusions: this study highlights a significant knowledge gap among Belarusian HCPs about mpox vaccines and treatments, despite a general awareness of the disease's epidemiology and symptoms, and it underscores the need for targeted interventions to enhance mpox knowledge and vaccine acceptance.",,,,,"Riad, Abanoub/AAU-7046-2020; Klugar, Miloslav/E-5748-2018; Koscik, Michal/ACJ-9399-2022","Riad, Abanoub/0000-0001-5918-8966; Klugar, Miloslav/0000-0002-2804-7295; Koscik, Michal/0000-0002-9243-6391; DROBOV, Anton/0000-0001-8946-591X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,AUG,2023,11,8,,,,,,,1368,10.3390/vaccines11081368,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11081368,,,,,,,,37631936,,,,,WOS:001056151700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population.

The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the development and assessment of the effectiveness of a workplace intervention aimed at reducing these harmful phenomena. Methods and analysis This protocol describes a two-wave quasi-experimental intervention. Each of the three participating Finnish public sector organisations (cities) will select four work units (a total of 450-500 employees) to participate in an intervention including 2-3 workshops for the work unit, 2-3 consultative meetings with the supervisor of the work unit, a follow-up meeting for the entire work unit (a maximum of 6-month time lag) and online meetings with the supervisor to monitor achievements and discuss about difficult cases, if any. Three age-matched, sex-matched and occupation-matched controls for each participants of the intervention group will be randomly selected, a total 1350-1500 individuals in the control group. For intervention and control groups, premeasurement is based on responses to a survey that was conducted in 2020. Postintervention measurement will be based on survey responses in 2022.

When traditional nCPAP pressures are insufficient, other modes including nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are used. In recent years, high nCPAP pressures (>= 9 cmH2O) have also emerged as an alternative. However, the comparative benefits and risks of these modalities remain unknown.Methods and analysis In this multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial, infants < 29 weeks' gestational age (GA) who either: (A) fail treatment with traditional nCPAP or (B) being extubated from invasive mechanical ventilation with mean airway pressure >= 10 cmH(2)O, will be randomised to receive either high nCPAP (positive end-expiratory pressure 9-15 cmH2O) or NIPPV (target mean Paw 9-15 cmH(2)O). Primary outcome is feasibility of the conduct of a larger, definitive trial as assessed by rates of recruitment and protocol violations. The main secondary outcome is failure of assigned treatment within 7 days postrandomisation. Multiple other clinical outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be ascertained.

To reduce salt intake, Action on Salt China (ASC) was launched in 2017. As one of four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the ASC programme, a comprehensive intervention study was designed to test whether all the components of the interventions adopted by other RCTs are acceptable, scalable and effective when provided to a region in the real world. Methods and analysis Using a cluster RCT design, 2688 participants were selected from 48 towns (clusters) in 12 counties in 6 provinces and assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Randomisation was performed after the baseline survey was completed. Information on salt-related knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP), blood pressure and 24-hour urinary sodium were collected. The intervention includes government engagement, health education and other intervention components targeting restaurants, home cooks and primary school students and their families that have been used in other RCTs. The control group will not receive the intervention. The project will be followed up for 2 years, with the intervention being carried out for the first year only. The primary outcome is salt intake measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion after 1 year. The secondary outcomes are the long-lasting effectiveness on salt intake and blood pressure measured by the same method, as well as salt-related KAP and blood pressure at the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups.

Observational studies suggest that digital health interventions can be an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, evidence from large randomised clinical trials is lacking. Methods and analysis The CV-PREVITAL study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label interventional trial designed to compare the effectiveness of an educational and motivational mobile health (mHealth) intervention versus usual care in reducing CV risk. The intervention aims at improving diet, physical activity, sleep quality, psycho-behavioural aspects, as well as promoting smoking cessation and adherence to pharmacological treatment for CV risk factors. The trial aims to enrol approximately 80 000 subjects without overt CVDs referring to general practitioners' offices, community pharmacies or clinics of Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care (Italian acronym IRCCS) affiliated with the Italian Cardiology Network. All participants are evaluated at baseline and after 12 months to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on short-term endpoints, namely improvement in CV risk score and reduction of major CV risk factors. Beyond the funded life of the study, a long-term (7 years) follow-up is also planned to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on the incidence of major adverse CV events. A series of ancillary studies designed to evaluate the effect of the mHealth intervention on additional risk biomarkers are also performed. Ethics and dissemination This study received ethics approval from the ethics committee of the coordinating centre (Monzino Cardiology Center; R1256/20-CCM 1319) and from all other relevant IRBs and ethics committees.

The BC COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns Survey (BC-Mix) was established as a surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the demographic characteristics of respondents. Participants The ongoing repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow-up survey is sent to participants 2-4 weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are weighted to BC's population by age, sex, geography and ethnicity to obtain generalisable estimates. Additional indices such as the Material and Social Deprivation Index, residential instability, economic dependency, and others are generated using census and location data. Findings to date As of 26 July 2021, over 61 000 baseline survey responses were received of which 41 375 were eligible for analysis. Of the eligible participants, about 60% consented to follow-up and about 27% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with healthcare databases. Approximately 83.5% of respondents were female, 58.7% were 55 years or older, 87.5% identified as white and 45.9% had at least a university degree. After weighting, approximately 50% were female, 39% were 55 years or older, 65% identified as white and 50% had at least a university degree.

Evaluation of patient experience among racial and ethnic minority groups has been difficult due to lack of representation in traditional health care surveys. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying racial and ethnic disparities in patient experience across the United States from 2013 to 2016. Methods: In total, 851,973 patient experience tweets with geographic location information from the United States were collected from 2013 to 2016. Patient experience tweets included discussions related to care received in a hospital, urgent care, or any other health institution. Ordinary least squares multiple regression was used to model patient experience sentiment and racial and ethnic groups over the 2013 to 2016 period and in relation to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. Results: Racial and ethnic distribution of users on Twitter was highly correlated with population estimates from the United States Census Bureau's 5-year survey from 2016 (r(2) =0.99; P<.001). From 2013 to 2016, the average patient experience sentiment was highest for White patients, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native patients. A reduction in negative patient experience sentiment on Twitter for all racial and ethnic groups was seen from 2013 to 2016. Twitter users who identified as Hispanic/Latino showed the greatest improvement in patient experience, with a 1.5 times greater increase (P<.001) than Twitter users who identified as White. Twitter users who identified as Black had the highest increase in patient experience postimplementation of the ACA (2014-2016) compared with preimplementation of the ACA (2013), and this change was 2.2 times (P<.001) greater than Twitter users who identified as White. Conclusions: The ACA mandated the implementation of the measurement of patient experience of care delivery. Considering that quality assessment of care is required, Twitter may offer the ability to monitor patient experiences across diverse racial and ethnic groups and inform the evaluation of health policies like the ACA.",,,,,"Williams, David/HKN-3732-2023; Subramanian, S V/K-6730-2015","Viswanath, K/0000-0002-4795-5803; SEWALK, KARA/0000-0002-2917-0869; Tuli, Gaurav/0000-0002-5626-7463; Hawkins, Jared/0000-0002-6352-1618; Subramanian, S V/0000-0003-2365-4165",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,AUG 21,2020,22,8,,,,,,,e17048,10.2196/17048,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/17048,,,,,,,,32821062,,,,,WOS:000575055700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Raina",,,Using Open-Source Intelligence to Detect Early Signals of COVID-19 in China: Descriptive Study,JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and the first cases were officially identified around December 8, 2019. Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using open-source data. Methods: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu. Results: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17. Conclusions: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31, 2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship, given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22 was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting that the infection was present prior to December.",,,,,"MacIntyre, Chandini Raina/D-4182-2011","Chen, Xin/0000-0002-9905-2307; Zhu, Mengyao/0000-0002-7898-173X; Kpozehouen, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8642-7547; MacIntyre, C Raina/0000-0002-3060-0555",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,JUL-SEP,2020,6,3,,,,,415,420,e18939,10.2196/18939,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18939,,,,,,,,32598290,,,,,WOS:000578947300039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding of persistent vaccine hesitancy during the 608 campaign to vaccinate those aged over 60 years and 8 medical risk groups was needed. On-the-ground surveys place further demands on resources and are scale limited. We leveraged the University of Maryland COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (UMD-CTIS), a digital health survey conducted among daily Facebook user samples, to fill this need and inform regional vaccine rollout policy.Objective: The aims of this study were to characterize COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, frequent reasons for hesitancy, mitigating risk behaviors, and the most trusted sources of COVID-19 information through which to combat vaccine hesitancy in Bangkok, Thailand during the 608 vaccine campaign.Methods: We analyzed 34,423 Bangkok UMD-CTIS responses between June and October 2021, coinciding with the third COVID-19 wave. Sampling consistency and representativeness of the UMD-CTIS respondents were evaluated by comparing distributions of demographics, 608 priority groups, and vaccine uptake over time with source population data. Estimates of vaccine hesitancy in Bangkok and 608 priority groups were tracked over time. Frequently cited hesitancy reasons and trusted information sources were identified according to the 608 group and degree of hesitancy. Kendall tau was used to test statistical associations between vaccine acceptance and vaccine hesitancy.Results: The Bangkok UMD-CTIS respondents had similar demographics over weekly samples and compared to the Bangkok source population. Respondents self-reported fewer pre-existing health conditions compared to census data overall but had a similar prevalence of the important COVID-19 risk factor diabetes. UMD-CTIS vaccine uptake rose in parallel with national vaccination statistics, while vaccine hesitancy and degree of hesitancy declined (-7% hesitant per week). Concerns about vaccination side effects (2334/3883, 60.1%) and wanting to wait and see (2410/3883, 62.1%) were selected most frequently, while not liking vaccines (281/3883, 7.2%) and religious objections (52/3883, 1.3%) were selected least frequently. Greater vaccine acceptance was associated positively with wanting to wait and see and negatively with don't believe I need (the vaccine) (Kendall tau 0.21 and -0.22, respectively; adjusted P<.001). Scientists and health experts were most frequently cited as trusted COVID-19 information sources (13,600/14,033, 96.9%), even among vaccine hesitant respondents.Conclusions: Our findings provide policy and health experts with evidence that vaccine hesitancy was declining over the study timeframe. Hesitancy and trust analyses among the unvaccinated support Bangkok policy measures to address vaccine safety and efficacy concerns through health experts rather than government or religious officials. Large-scale surveys enabled by existing widespread digital networks offer an insightful minimal-infrastructure resource for informing region-specific health policy needs.",,,,,,"Remmel, Christopher/0000-0002-4696-3692; Tuli, Gaurav/0000-0002-5626-7463; Kosiyaporn, Hathairat/0000-0002-7203-8089; Han, Aimee/0000-0001-8927-3432; Netrpukdee, Chanikarn/0000-0001-7796-384X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,,2023,9,,,,,,,,,10.2196/40186,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/40186,,,,,,,,36811852,,,,,WOS:001008842600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board, the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics boards of each participating study centre.

They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MethodsWe conducted a telephone survey (May-June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. FindingsMass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice. ConclusionOur paper adds to the literature on people living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19 prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further attention.",,,,,"Boehnke, Jan R./H-3468-2019","Boehnke, Jan R./0000-0003-0249-1870; Aslam, Faiza/0000-0002-7847-7250; Siddiqi, Najma/0000-0003-1794-2152; Nizami, Asad Tamizuddin/0000-0002-7853-8519; Paton, Lewis William/0000-0002-3328-5634",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-0640,,,,,FEB 14,2022,13,,,,,,,,785059,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.785059,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.785059,,,,,,,,35237185,,,,,WOS:000770667400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Topic Models are widely used in microblog analytics for analyzing and integrating the textual data within a corpus. This paper uses health tweets as microblogs and attempts the health data clustering by topic models. The traditional topic models, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (PLSI), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and integer Joint NMF(intJNMF) methods are used for health data clustering; however, they are intractable to assess the number of health topic clusters. Proper visualizations are essential to extract the information from and identifying trends of data, as they may include thousands of documents and millions of words. For visualization of topic clouds and health tendency in the document collection, we present hybrid topic models by integrating traditional topic models with VAT. Proposed hybrid topic models viz., Visual Non-negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) and Visual Latent Schematic Indexing (VLSI) are promising methods for accessing the health tendency and visualization of topic clusters from benchmarked and Twitter datasets.

However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products. To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations. Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested with and without manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and Tween 20) as well as the impact of temperature (4 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 45 degrees C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance. Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer) resulted in false-positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2 positive controls tested under proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is nonspecific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function. Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of temperature and humidity outside manufacturer claims. Our data support strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false-positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation. IMPORTANCE With the Panbio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test being deployed in over 120 countries worldwide, understanding conditions required for its ideal performance is critical. Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed. While erroneous results from improper use of a test may not be surprising to some health care professionals, understanding why false positives occur can help reduce the propagation of misinformation and provide a scientific rebuttal for these aberrant findings. This study demonstrated that the kit buffer's pH, ionic strength, and buffering capacity were critical components to ensure proper kit function and avoid generation of false-positive results. Typically, false positives arise from cross-reacting or interfering substances; however, this study demonstrated a mechanism where false positives were generated under conditions favoring nonspecific interactions between the two antibodies designed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2165-0497,,,,,OCT,2021,9,2,,,,,,,e00683-21,10.1128/Spectrum.00683-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/Spectrum.00683-21,,,,,,,,34668722,,,,,WOS:000728629300085,View Full Record in Web of Science

This new disease has significant social and financial impacts. The objective is to determine the prevalence of long COVID in the Tunisian population and identify its predictive factors.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study conducted among Tunisians who were infected with COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2022. An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed through social media, radio, and television channels over the course of one month (February 2022). Long COVID was defined as the persistence of existing symptoms or the development of new symptoms within three months after onset, lasting for at least two months, and with no differential diagnosis. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using binary stepwise logistic regression with a significance level set at 5%.ResultsA total of 1911 patients participated in our study, and the prevalence of long COVID was 46.5%. The two most frequent categories were general and neurological post-COVID syndrome, with a prevalence of 36.7% each. The most commonly observed symptoms were fatigue (63.7%) and memory problems (49.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive factors for long COVID were female gender and age of 60 years or older, while complete anti-COVID vaccination was found to be a protective factor.ConclusionsOur study found that complete vaccination was a protective factor against long COVID, while female gender and age of 60 years or older were identified as the main risk factors.

BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). Conclusions and relevance We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers.

Nursing students being future first-line healthcare workers are more at risk of being infected and exposed to various stressors from shared information. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 among nursing students and to estimate predictors of their risk perception. Methods We conducted an online survey among undergraduate nursing students at three selected Japanese Universities. Data on knowledge, attitude, and perception toward COVID-19 were collected using a structured questionnaire. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with the risk perception toward COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 414 nursing students who participated in the study, 368 (90.4%) reported that the media including radio, television, internet, and/or social media were the main source of knowledge. Fever (96.1%) and dry cough (89.6%) were reported as the main symptoms. Regarding the attitude toward the treatment and preventive measures, almost 92.8% of participants recommended the use of vaccines. Being female appeared to be three times associated with the fear of getting infected (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-7.58). Students who took part in extracurricular activities reported that they feared being infected with COVID-19 (aOR:2.62; 95% CI:1.33-5.16). Other factors did not show an association. Conclusion Knowledge and attitude of nursing students toward COVID-19 were accurate for the majority of them, with the main source of information being the media. Practicing extracurricular activities and being female were associated with the fear of the disease.

The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information. Material and methods We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as experience, fact or opinion, and as positive, negative and neutral. Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus. Results We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (approximate to 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial.",,,,,"; Plaza, Laura/H-9995-2015",", Javier/0000-0002-9006-9639; Carrillo-de-Albornoz, Jorge/0000-0002-1449-1547; Plaza, Laura/0000-0001-5144-8014",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 29,2018,13,11,,,,,,,e0207996,10.1371/journal.pone.0207996,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207996,,,,,,,,30496232,,,,,WOS:000451763800072,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design Before-and-after study design. Setting Primary health facilities in Gombe State, Northeastern Nigeria. Participants Monitoring and evaluation officers and maternal, newborn and child health coordinators for state-level and all 11 local government areas (district-equivalent) overseeing 492 primary care facilities offering maternal and newborn care services. Intervention Between April 2017 and December 2018, we implemented an integrated data quality intervention which included: introduction of job aids and regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support through social media. Outcome measures 9 metrics for the data quality dimensions of completeness and timeliness, internal consistency of reported data, and external consistency. Results The data quality intervention was associated with improvements in seven of nine data quality metrics assessed including availability and timeliness of reporting, completeness of data elements, accuracy of facility reporting, consistency between related data elements, and frequency of outliers reported. Improvement differed by data element type, with content of care and commodity-related data improving more than contact-related data. Increases in the consistency between related data elements demonstrated improved internal consistency within and across facility documentation.

The main purpose of the knowledge base is to discover and evaluate risk factors and situations which can lead to such diseases, and to enable the formation and support of a preventative measures plan. The present version of the knowledge base is implemented using a heterogeneous semantic network approach and utilizes expert opinions about risk factors and events influencing an individual's health. Data includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and external environment. Data is compiled with the aid of questionnaires, mobile devices, case histories and information from social media. Information from social media is analyzed using data and text mining methods with the goal of evaluating the user's condition. All of the data obtained is accumulated in a single database. The knowledge base establishes risk factors, including changes in those factors over the course of time, and circumstances or events which might precipitate the emergence of pathology. Hypotheses are generated about the current state of the user's health, the active risk factors which created conditions for the onset of disease, and circumstances which might produce an increase or decrease in risk factors. Prophylactic measures to reduce those risks are suggested through analysis of the hypotheses generated. Recommendations regarding prophylactic measures are formed with the aid of the knowledge base, the user case-library, and collaborative filtering methods. Recommendations are based on 4P medicine, which re-quires mandatory participation of system users in maintaining their health. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Main outcome measures Symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; modified Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) above screening thresholds. Adjusting for multiple covariates and comorbidities, multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the association between COVID-19 severity and mental morbidities. Results Compared with individuals without a diagnosis of COVID-19, patients recovering from COVID-19 had increased risk of depression (22.1% vs 16.2%; adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.48, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.82) and PTSD (19.5% vs 15.6%; aRR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75) but not anxiety (13.1% vs 11.3%; aRR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.64). Elevated relative risks were limited to patients recovering from COVID-19 that were 40 years or older and were particularly high among individuals with university education.

Methods A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. Results We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship.

Nevertheless, recent years have seen a rapid increase in the frequency at which people eat out. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed for salt reduction in restaurants through a randomised controlled trial in China. Methods and analysis As a randomised controlled trial with restaurants as study subjects, we recruited 192 restaurants from 12 counties of 6 provinces in China. After the baseline survey, restaurants were randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Using social cognitive theory, comprehensive intervention activities were designed to encourage salt reduction in all restaurant foods, and at the same time, to encourage consumers to choose lower salt options when eating out. The interventions will be conducted only in restaurants of the intervention group during the first year. The follow-up assessment will be conducted at the end of the trial. The primary outcome is the change in the average salt content of the five best-selling dishes of the restaurant, as measured by laboratory tests. Secondary outcomes include differences in the monthly use of salt and salty condiments between intervention and control restaurants, and the knowledge, attitude and practice on salt among restaurant consumers.

This study aimed to assess medical students' knowledge and attitude about Mpox and to identify factors affecting their level of knowledge and attitude in low-income and high-income countries. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on 11,919 medical students from 27 countries. A newly-developed validated questionnaire was used to collect data on knowledge (14 items), attitude (12 items), and baseline criteria. The relationship between a range of factors with knowledge and attitude was studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results46% of the study participants were males; 10.7% were in their sixth year; 54.6% knew about smallpox; 84% received the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine; and 12.5% had training on Mpox. 55.3% had good knowledge of Mpox and 51.7% had a positive attitude towards it. Medical students in their third, fifth, or sixth year high- income countries who obtained information on Mpox from friends, research articles, social media and scientific websites were positive predictors for good knowledge. Conversely, being male or coming from high-income countries showed a negative relation with good knowledge about Mpox. Additionally, a positive attitude was directly influenced by residing in urban areas, being in the fifth year of medical education, having knowledge about smallpox and a history of receiving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Receiving information about Mpox from social media or scientific websites and possessing good knowledge about Mpox were also predictors of a positive attitude. On the other hand, being male, employed, or receiving a training program about Mpox were inversely predicting positive attitude about Mpox. ConclusionThere were differences in knowledge and attitude towards Mpox between medical students in low and high-income countries, emphasizing the need for incorporating epidemiology of re-emerging diseases like Mpox into the medical curriculum to improve disease prevention and control.",,,,,"Ghazy, ramy Mohamed/AAH-4373-2019; Abd ElHafeez, Samar/IUN-0236-2023; Abdel-Rahman, Suzan/AAW-7679-2021; Youssef, Naglaa FA/GQP-7870-2022; Sallam, Malik/O-5021-2014","Ghazy, ramy Mohamed/0000-0001-7611-706X; Abd ElHafeez, Samar/0000-0002-3250-2780; Abdel-Rahman, Suzan/0000-0002-5779-0926; Youssef, Naglaa FA/0000-0002-0368-1759; Sallam, Malik/0000-0002-0165-9670; Gebreal, Assem/0000-0002-2155-8500; Elehamer, Nafisa M K/0000-0002-5416-7370",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,JUL 26,2023,11,,,,,,,,1192542,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1192542,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1192542,,,,,,,,37575128,,,,,WOS:001037061300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although >50 prolonged symptoms of LC have been described, it remains a diagnostic challenge for military providers and therefore threatens operational readiness. MethodsOn 9 September 2021, an online survey was emailed to 2192 Belgian Defence personnel who had previously tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 17 August 2020 and 31 May 2021. A total of 718 validated responses were received.Descriptive analyses determined the prevalence of LC and 10 most common symptoms and their duration following infection. In the explanatory analyses, risk factors related to LC were identified. To establish the health-related impact of LC on quality of life (HRQoL), we used the results from the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire. ResultsThe most frequent symptoms that were reported for >3 months were fatigue, lack of energy and breathing difficulties.47.35% of the respondents reported at least one persistent symptom, while 21.87% reported more than 3 symptoms lasting for at least 3 months after the initial COVID-19 infection. Most patients with LC suffered from symptoms of a neuropsychiatric nature (71.76%).LC was significantly associated with obesity; pre-existing respiratory disease and blood or immune disorders. Physical activity of >3 hours per week halved the risk of LC.The total QoL is reduced in patients with LC. Considering the five dimensions of the questionnaire, only the self-care dimension was not influenced by the presence of LC.

Frailty and pain can interact, such that symptoms of frailty can make pain assessment difficult and pain can exacerbate the progression of frailty. The prevalence of frailty and pain and their concurrence in hospital settings are not well understood, and patients with cognitive impairment are often excluded from pain prevalence studies due to difficulties assessing their pain. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of frailty and pain in adult inpatients, including those with cognitive impairment, in an acute care private metropolitan hospital in Western Australia. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational, single-day point prevalence, cross-sectional study of frailty and pain intensity of all inpatients (excluding day surgery and critical care units) will be undertaken. Frailty will be assessed using the modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale. Current pain intensity will be assessed using the PainChek smart-device application enabling pain assessment in people unable to report pain due to cognitive impairment. Participants will also provide a numerical rating of the intensity of current pain and the worst pain experienced in the previous 24 hours. Demographic and clinical information will be collected from patient files. The overall response rate of the survey will be reported, as well as the percentage prevalence of frailty and of pain in the sample (separately for PainChek scores and numerical ratings). Additional statistical modelling will be conducted comparing frailty scores with pain scores, adjusting for covariates including age, gender, ward type and reason for admission.

This study seeks to highlight the global significance of the Vietnamese response model in the fight against COVID-19. The study suggests that the Vietnamese Government's procedures, from central officials to grassroots cadre, have significance on three levels with comparative importance. First, attention is given to the use of tracking mechanisms enabled by medical surveillance and record systems. Then, the role of social media in educational epidemiology. Finally, we highlight the adjustment of Vietnamese social practices, behaviours, and cultural habituation, which were crucial in fighting the pandemic.

These semi-mechanistic models are relatively new to the infectious diseases toolkit and enable us to combine disease specific information such as the infectious profile with statistical rigour to recreate temporal disease transmission. We show that these methods are very suited to modelling malaria in communities close to eliminating malaria-in particular China and Eswatini-where we are able to disentangle the contribution of exogenous (external) transmission and endogenous (person-to-person) transmission. This is particularly important for developing policies when counties are approaching elimination. Developing new methods for modelling infectious diseases outbreaks is important for monitoring transmission and developing policy. In this paper we propose using semi-mechanistic Hawkes Processes for modelling malaria transmission in near-elimination settings. Hawkes Processes are well founded mathematical methods that enable us to combine the benefits of both statistical and mechanistic models to recreate and forecast disease transmission beyond just malaria outbreak scenarios. These methods have been successfully used in numerous applications such as social media and earthquake modelling, but are not yet widespread in epidemiology. By using domain-specific knowledge, we can both recreate transmission curves for malaria in China and Eswatini and disentangle the proportion of cases which are imported from those that are community based.",,,,,"Bhatt, Samir/JPA-1390-2023; Mishra, Swapnil/AAT-3955-2020; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei/R-6167-2019","Bhatt, Samir/0000-0002-0891-4611; Mishra, Swapnil/0000-0002-8759-5902; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei/0000-0003-0381-669X; /0000-0002-6175-5648; Lai, Shengjie/0000-0001-9781-8148; Unwin, Juliette/0000-0002-9120-4003; Cohen, Justin/0000-0003-4481-6784",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,APR,2021,17,4,,,,,,,e1008830,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008830,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008830,,,,,,,,33793564,,,,,WOS:000636466800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nonetheless, existing efforts mostly focus on general graphs without time information, few studies concentrate on temporal graphs, where a relationship between two vertices takes place at a specific moment and lingers for some time. Moreover, real-world temporal networks become increasingly large, and are usually distributed over multiple machines. These foster the need for evaluating pattern matching on distributed temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a new notion so-called time-respecting flow graph, in which all paths spreading from one vertex to another are time-respecting (i.e., a series of contacts with non-decreasing time), and one vertex is distinguished as the root from which other vertices can be reached via a time-respecting path. Based on this, we explore the problem of distributed time-respecting flow graph pattern matching on temporal graphs, which could be applied in many fields such as epidemiology, social media, national security, communication, to name just a few. We present a distributed baseline algorithm based on GraphX as well as an optimized algorithm that utilizes the properties of time-respecting flow graph and the analyses of distributed algorithms to boost efficiency.

Yet the environmental factors in the existing literature do not appear to provide a satisfactory explanation for this increase. Objective: To determine whether nine variables are associated with CD in children. These variables are: incidence of ear infection before 2 years old, courses of antibiotics before 2 years old, duration of breastfeeding, vitamin D drop exposure in infancy, vitamin D supplement exposure between 2-3 years old, age at gluten introduction into the diet, fat content of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, quantity of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, and type of water consumed at 2 years old. Methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted among parents living in the US with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years old. Potential participants were informed about the survey through social media, websites, electronic newsletters, and advertisements. Results: After exclusions, there remained 332 responses associated with children with CD (cases), and 241 responses associated with children who do not have CD (controls).

We will report unadjusted and risk-adjusted DAOH values between Maori and non-Maori using direct risk standardisation. We will risk adjust first for age and sex, then for each of deprivation (NZDep18), levels of morbidity (M3 score) and rurality. We will report DAOH values across three time periods, 30, 90 and 365 days and across nine deciles of the DAOH distribution (0.1-0.9 inclusive). We will interpret all results from a Kaupapa Maori research positioning, acknowledging that Maori health outcomes are directly tied to the unequal distribution of the social determinants of health. Ethics and disseminationEthics approval for this study was given by the Auckland Health Research Ethics Committee. Outputs from this study are likely to interest a range of audiences. We plan to disseminate our findings through academic channels, presentations to interested groups including Maori-specific hui (meetings), social media and lay press.",,,,,"tamatea, jade/AAT-8230-2021","tamatea, jade/0000-0002-4144-4316; Merry, Alan/0000-0001-7100-009X; Boyle, Luke/0000-0001-6114-1833",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,JUL,2023,13,7,,,,,,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066876,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066876,,,,,,,,37518091,,,,,WOS:001042144300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Newspaper reports are an important factor in shaping public attitudes towards mental illnesses, as well as working as a barometer reflecting public opinion. This study aims to assess the way that coverage of mental health topics and different mental illnesses has changed since 2008. Method Articles covering mental health in 18 different newspapers were retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days of each month in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. A content analysis approach using a structured coding framework was used to extract information from the articles. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the change in odds of each hypothesised stigmatising or anti-stigmatising element occurring in 2019 compared to 2008 and 2016 with a Wald test to assess the overall significance of year as a predictor in the model. Further logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the diagnosis that an article was about and the odds that it was stigmatising, and whether this relationship is moderated by year of publication. Results A total of 6731 articles were analysed, and there was a significant increase in anti-stigmatising articles in 2019 compared to 2008 (OR 3.16 (2.60-3.84), p < 0.001) and 2016 (OR 1.40 (1.16-1.69), p < 0.001). Of the 5142 articles that specified a diagnosis, articles about schizophrenia were 6.37 times more likely to be stigmatising than articles about other diagnoses (OR 6.37 (3.05-13.29) p < 0.001), and there was evidence that the strength of this relationship significantly interacted with the year an article was published (p = 0.010). Articles about depression were significantly less likely to be stigmatising (OR 0.59 (0.69-0.85) p = 0.018) than those about other diagnoses, while there was no difference in coverage of eating disorders v. other diagnoses (OR 1.37 (0.67-2.80) p = 0.386); neither of these relationships showed an interaction with the year of publication. Conclusion Anti-stigma programmes should continue to work with newspapers to improve coverage of mental illness. However, interventions should consider providing specific guidance and promote awareness of rarer mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, and evaluation should examine whether reductions in stigma extend to people with all mental illness diagnoses.",,,,,,"Satchwell, Laura Charlotte/0000-0002-2935-6532; Hildersley, Rosanna/0000-0002-1850-6101",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7960,2045-7979,,,,,2020,29,,,,,,,,e177,10.1017/S204579602000089X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S204579602000089X,,,,,,,,33148367,,,,,WOS:000586288500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have measured alcohol imagery content and branding in popular Indian films, in total and in relation to language and age rating. Design In this observational study we measured alcohol imagery semiquantitatively using 5-minute interval coding. We coded each interval according to whether it contained alcohol imagery or brand appearances. Setting India. Participants None. Content analysis of a total of 30 national box office hit films over a period of 3years from 2015 to 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures To assess alcohol imagery in Indian films and its distribution in relation to age and language rating has been determined. Results The 30 films included 22 (73%) Hindi films and 8 (27%) in regional languages. Seven (23%) were rated suitable for viewing by all ages (U), and 23 (77%) rated as suitable for viewing by children subject to parental guidance for those aged under 12 (UA). Any alcohol imagery was seen in 97% of the films, with 195 of a total of 923 5-minute intervals, and actual alcohol use in 25 (83%) films, in 90 (10%) intervals. The occurrence of these and other categories of alcohol imagery was similar in U-rated and UA-rated films, and in Hindi and local language films. Episodes of alcohol branding occurred in 10 intervals in five films. Conclusion Almost all films popular in India contain alcohol imagery, irrespective of age rating and language. Measures need to be undertaken to limit alcohol imagery in Indian films to protect the health of young people, and to monitor alcohol imagery in other social media platforms in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,MAY,2021,11,5,,,,,,,e040630,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040630,,,,,,,,34078627,,,,,WOS:000763691200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: This study was based on the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey established in early May 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms. The sociodemographic information and routine dietary patterns before and after lockdown of participants were investigated. t tests and chi (2) tests were used to compare the differences in consumption patterns of twelve major food groups and beverages between sex and across educational levels before and after lockdown. Factor analysis was employed to obtain the main dietary patterns. Settings: China. Participants: A total of 10 082 youths. Results: A significant decrease was observed in the average weekly frequency of rice intake, while significant increases were observed in the frequency of intake of wheat products, other staple foods, fish, eggs, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit and dairy products (all P values < 0 center dot 01). Heterogeneities of average weekly frequency existed between sex and across educational levels to different extents. The three main dietary patterns derived were loaded most heavily on dairy products, rice and wheat products, separately; the rice pattern became more dominant than the wheat products pattern after lockdown. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased, while the frequency of other beverages had increased. Conclusions: Our timely survey would inform policymakers and health professionals of these significant changes in youths' dietary patterns after lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sex and across educational levels, for better policy-making and public health practice.",,,,,"Jia, Peng/K-1446-2017","Jia, Peng/0000-0003-0110-3637; Yu, Bin/0000-0003-2683-2262; Zhang, Dong/0000-0002-7522-9630; Yang, Shujuan/0000-0002-6929-4823",,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-9800,1475-2727,,,,AUG,2021,24,11,,,,,3221,3232,PII S1368980020005170,10.1017/S1368980020005170,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020005170,,,,,,,,33993895,,,,,WOS:000679049000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and women. Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative measures was 44.9-58.8% for males and 53.4-68.1% for females. After adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.45, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not touching face (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive information from their cancer institutes and social media.

Lavista; Grannis, Shaun J.",,,Capturing COVID-19-Like Symptoms at Scale Using Banner Ads on an Online News Platform: Pilot Survey Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Identifying new COVID-19 cases is challenging. Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors. Methods: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. Results: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R-2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. Conclusions: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.",,,,,"Dixon, Brian E/A-9494-2013","Dixon, Brian E/0000-0002-1121-0607; Wiensch, Ashley/0000-0001-6694-8089; Lavista, Juan M/0000-0002-9654-3178; Grannis, Shaun/0000-0002-8093-6639",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAY 20,2021,23,5,,,,,,,e24742,10.2196/24742,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24742,,,,,,,,33872190,,,,,WOS:000653122500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: In July 2020 and January 2021, we used social media to survey 2 samples of women of reproductive age who had not been surgically sterilized and were not currently pregnant about their experiences seeking contraception. We explore whether experiences differed for people experiencing social and/or economic disadvantage due to COVID-19, using multivariable logistic regression to control for age, education and income. Results: In July 2020, 51.5% of respondents who sought contraception (total N = 3064) reported barriers to care compared to 55.3% in January 2021 (total N = 2276). A larger percent (14% in July 2020 and 22% in Jan 2021) reported not using their preferred method of contraception due to COVID-19. Individuals experiencing income loss (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.04 early in the COVID-19 pandemic and OR = 1.58, 1.21-2.06 mid COVID-19 pandemic) and hunger (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.40 early and OR = 2.02, 1.55-2.64 mid-COVID-19 pandemic) were more likely to report they would be using a different method if not for COVID-19, compared to respondents without income loss or hunger. Conclusions: COVID-19 has complicated access to contraception, especially for disadvantaged populations. Implications: Effort s are needed to ensure access to contraception despite the COVID-19 epidemic, especially for disadvantaged populations. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean section in the world (45%); much higher than what we would expect. We do not fully understand why this is happening, but we think social influences are important. We know that traditional and social media are important social influences on health and health-seeking behaviors in other countries. In our study, we aimed to explore how cesarean section is portrayed in Facebook Mexican media pages, and how people (Facebook users) interacted with these articles. To do this, we identified the most popular Facebook media pages in Mexico. Next, we searched for all articles posted to these pages. We found 80 articles and studied them to understand how they discussed cesarean section. We found that media articles posted on Facebook did not encourage women to have cesarean section, and they correctly showed risks and consequences. Then, we explored the comments from Facebook users that were attached to these posts about cesarean section. We found 6350 comments, and classified each comment based on the what the Facebook users said. Lastly, we connected the main themes of the articles to the types of comments. We found that Facebook users distrusted the Mexican health system, rejected information about the consequences of cesarean section, and often responded with the content with sexist and aggressive comments against women. Our research shows that while there is accurate and useful information on social media about cesarean section, other social issues like gender inequality and violence may influence pregnancy and childbirth. Background Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean sections globally at over 45%. There is limited research about social factors influencing these rates. This study explores the portrayal and perceptions of cesarean section in Facebook media pages to better understand the socio-cultural context of childbirth in Mexico. Methods This is a mixed-methods social media analysis using two data sources. First, to study the portrayal of cesarean section, we identified ten Mexican media Facebook pages with the largest audiences (based on number of page likes). We searched these pages for articles containing the word cesarea (Spanish for cesarean section), and posts (articles) were eligible for inclusion if they contained the word cesarea. Second, to understand perceptions of cesarean section portrayal, we extracted comment threads of each Facebook post sharing the included articles. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of articles and a quantitative content analysis of comments. Results We included 133 Facebook posts depicting 80 unique articles and identified three major themes: (1) information about cesarean section, (2) inequality and violence against women, (3) governance failures. Cesarean section was portrayed as a lifesaving procedure when medical necessary, and riskier than vaginal birth, with a longer recovery time, and possible negative health consequences. We extracted comments from 133 Facebook posts, and 6350 comments were included. We inductively developed 20 codes to then classify comments under six major categories: (1) violence and discrimination, (2) health and health services, (3) mode of birth choice, (4) disbelief at information about cesarean section, (5) abortion, and (6) discontent at the government. Conclusions We found that Facebook media did not promote cesarean section over vaginal birth, and risks and consequences were mostly represented reliably. Perceptions about the portrayal of cesarean section showed strong discontent and distrust against providers and the health system, as well as rejection of factual information about the consequences of cesarean section. We documented gross gender inequality and violence against women, highlighting the urgent need for human rights approaches to maternal health to address these inequalities and prevent harmful practices. Our study also contributes to the emerging field of social media analysis, and demonstrates clear areas where social media communication can be improved.",,,,,"Vazquez Corona, Martha/HSE-4990-2023","Vazquez Corona, Martha/0000-0003-2061-9540; Bohren, Meghan/0000-0002-4179-4682",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1742-4755,,,,FEB 22,2022,19,1,,,,,,,49,10.1186/s12978-022-01351-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12978-022-01351-8,,,,,,,,35193590,,,,,WOS:000759559900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

During a pandemic, vitamins and minerals are vital to health. Therefore, the prevalence and epidemiology of supplement use in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic must be known. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online survey. The study was con-ducted from June to March 2022 on both adults and children. The link to the survey was shared on social media platforms. The survey included questions on participants' demographics, vaccination status, supplements they used, and side effects of supplements. Participation in this study was optional, and there was no obligation to participate. There was a declaration about the aim of the study and different objectives before starting the survey. Results: The present study reported that most of the participants reported that they used vitamin C (64.6 %), zinc (51.9 %), multivitamins (46.1 %), black seeds (26.7 %), garlic (Allium sativum) (15.4 %), omega-3 (22.1 %), vitamin D (22.2 %), echinacea (10.1 %), manuka honey (26.0 %), curcumin (13.6 %), ginger (22.5 %), royal jelly (12.9 %), and propolis (7.5 %) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Researchers have now begun to exploit the vast online data accumulated through passive crowdsourcing for studies in ecology and epidemiology. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of iParasitology, i.e. the use of internet data for tests of parasitological hypotheses, using hairworms (phylum Nematomorpha) as examples. These large worms are easily noticeable by people in general, and thus likely to generate interest on the internet. First, we show that internet search queries (collated with Google Trends) and photos uploaded to the internet (specifically, to the iNaturalist platform) point to parts of North America with many sightings of hairworms by the public, but few to no records in the scientific literature. Second, we demonstrate that internet searches predict seasonal peaks in hairworm abundance that accurately match scientific data. Finally, photos uploaded to the internet by non-scientists can provide reliable data on the host taxa that hairworms most frequently parasitize, and also identify hosts that appear to have been neglected by scientific studies.

It is also an area which has seen a rapid increase in the number of publications in the past 40 years. With the advent of online media and social media platforms, the volume of news has also increased. This review considered five types of nutrition research and how press releases linked to publications might be reported by the media. MethodsExamples were taken from nutrition-related articles published in the areas of in vitro work, animal data, epidemiology, clinical trials and data modelling publications which had press releases deposited in online repositories (EurekAlert! and AlphaGalileo). A critical narrative of the source of the media message, estimates of its reach and any potential exaggeration or source of confusion were identified. ResultsIt was clear that research has been reported by funders, journals and researchers' institutions in ways that claim extended findings of the data beyond that reported in the manuscript. This included inferences of health benefits in humans from laboratory studies, splitting outcome data for the same exposure in epidemiological studies based on perceived public interest, using clinical trials to make media claims that would not be permitted in advertisements and claiming modelled data for cases were actual changes in numbers of cases. ConclusionsIt is essential that funding bodies and institutions along with academic journals apply pressure to discourage exaggeration of research.

These datasets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical laws that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis.

There is little evidence of the models of care that optimise outcomes for injured older patients. This study aims to describe clinician perspectives of existing models of acute care for injured older patients in Australia and New Zealand.Methods: This cross-sectional online survey of healthcare professionals (HCP) managing injured older patients in Australia or New Zealand hospitals was conducted between November 2nd and December 12th, 2020. Recruitment was via survey link and snowball sampling to professional organisations and special interest groups via email and social media. HCP were asked, using a Likert scale, how likely four typical case vignettes were to be admitted to one of twelve options for ongoing care. Additional questions explored usual care components.Results: Participants (n = 157) were predominantly Australian medical professionals in a major trauma service (MTS) or metropolitan hospital. The most common age defining geriatric was aged 65 years and older (43%). HCP described variability in the models and components of acute care for older injured pa-tients in Australia and New Zealand. As a component of care, cognitive, delirium and frailty screening are occurring (60%, 61%, 46%) with HCP from non-major trauma services (non-MTS) reporting frailty and cog-nitive impairment screening more likely to occur in the emergency department (ED). Access to an acute pain service was more likely in a MTS. Participants described poor likelihood of a geriatrician (highest 16%) or physician (highest 12%) review in EDConclusion: Despite a low response rate, HCP in Australia and New Zealand describe variability in acute care pathways for injured older patients. Given the change in epidemiology of injury towards older pa-tients with low force mechanisms, models of acute injury care should be evaluated to define a cost-effective model and components of care that optimise patient-centred outcomes relevant to injured older patients. HCP described some factors they perceive to determine care, and outcomes of variability, offer-ing guidance for future research and resource allocation in the Australia and New Zealand trauma system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to characterize pelvic floor symptoms in cisgender women with EDS and to describe their impact on quality of life. Methods An online questionnaire on obstetric and gynecological experiences of cisgender women with EDS was disseminated through EDS patient societies and social media. This study was a sub-analysis of the broader questionnaire and focused on pelvic floor disorders, whereby self-reported symptoms and validated questionnaires were used to assess pelvic floor symptom severity (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, PFDI-20), impact on quality of life (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, PFIQ-7), and sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI-6). Groups based on age and EDS type were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests. Results A total of 1,303 participants were included in the analysis. Pelvic floor symptom prevalence included: stress urinary incontinence in 60%, urgency urinary incontinence in 54%, fecal incontinence in 24%, and pelvic organ prolapse in 21%. Bladder symptoms were reported to be the most bothersome. The impact of prolapse symptoms on quality of life was higher in women under age 40 than in older participants (p<0.001). Pelvic pain was reported in 71%. Pain ratings were highest for dysmenorrhea, muscle and joint pain, and backache (median 7 out of 10 for each).

Our study sought to assess factors contributing to HCW infection and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Design We conducted a cross sectional survey of HCWs (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), non-clinical staff) during May 2020. Participants completed a 42-item survey assessing disease transmission risk (clinical role, work environment, availability of personal protective equipment) and mental health (anxiety, depression and burn-out). Setting The questionnaire was disseminated over various social media platforms. 3083 respondents from 48 states, the District of Columbia and US territories accessed the survey. Participants Using a convenience sample of HCWs who worked during the pandemic, 3083 respondents accessed the survey and 2040 participants completed at least 80% of the survey. Primary outcome Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 infection, in addition to burn-out, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results Participants were largely from the Northeast and Southern USA, with attending physicians (31.12%), nurses (26.80%), EMTs (13.04%) with emergency medicine department (38.30%) being the most common department and specialty represented. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents met the criteria for being a probable case due to reported COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study to collect self-reported data on demographics, lifestyle, and endometriosis symptoms of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients from April 2019 to February 2020. The EPHect Minimal Clinical Questionnaire (EPQ-M) was translated into Spanish. Comprehension and length of the translated survey were assessed by Spanish-speaking women. An electronic link was distributed via social media of endometriosis patient associations from 11 Latin American countries and Spain. Descriptive statistics (frequency, means and SD, percentages, and proportions) and correlations were conducted using SPSSv26. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 1,378 participants from 23 countries; 94.6% had self-reported diagnosis of endometriosis. Diagnostic delay was 6.6 years. Most participants had higher education, private health insurance, and were employed. The most common symptoms were back/leg pain (85.4%) and fatigue (80.7%). The mean number of children was 1.5; 34.4% had miscarriages; the mean length of infertility was 3.7 years; 47.2% reported pregnancy complications. The most common hormone treatment was oral contraceptives (47.0%). The most common comorbidities were migraines (24.1%), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (22.2%), and irritable bowel syndrome (21.1%). Most participants (97.0%) experienced pelvic pain during menses; for 78.7%, pain was severe; 86.4% reported dyspareunia. The mean age of dysmenorrhea onset was 16.2 years (SD +/- 6.1). Hormone treatments were underutilized, while impact was substantial. Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly correlated with pain intensity (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive effort to generate a clinical-demographic profile of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients.

Midwives have a key role in advising women about alcohol during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate UK midwives' practices regarding the 2016 Chief Medical Officers Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy, and factors influencing their implementation during antenatal appointments.MethodsOnline cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of UK midwives recruited through professional networks and social media. Data were gathered using an anonymous online questionnaire addressing knowledge of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy; practice behaviours regarding alcohol assessment and advice; and questions based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to evaluate implementation of advising abstinence at antenatal booking and subsequent antenatal appointments.ResultsOf 842 questionnaire respondents, 58% were aware of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines of whom 91% (438) cited abstinence was recommended, although 19% (93) cited recommendations from previous guidelines. Nonetheless, 97% of 842 midwives always or usually advised women to abstain from alcohol at the booking appointment, and 38% at subsequent antenatal appointments. Mean TDF domain scores (range 1-7) for advising abstinence at subsequent appointments were highest (indicative of barriers) for social influences (3.65 sd 0.84), beliefs about consequences (3.16 sd 1.13) and beliefs about capabilities (3.03 sd 073); and lowest (indicative of facilitators) for knowledge (1.35 sd 0.73) and professional role and identity (1.46 sd 0.77). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TDF domains: beliefs about capabilities (OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.88), emotion (OR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.67, 0.90), and professional role and identity (OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.51, 0.95) were strong predictors of midwives advising all women to abstain from alcohol at appointments other than at booking.ConclusionsOur results suggest that skill development and reinforcement of support from colleagues and the wider maternity system could support midwives' implementation of alcohol advice at each antenatal appointment, not just at booking could lead to improved outcomes for women and infants. Implementation of alcohol care pathways in maternity settings are beneficial from a lifecourse perspective for women, children, families, and the wider community.",,,,,"Scholin, Lisa/IXE-0254-2023","Scholin, Lisa/0000-0002-1348-672X; Smith, Lesley/0000-0002-6418-0317; Dyson, Judith/0000-0002-0928-0438",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2393,,,,FEB 15,2021,21,1,,,,,,,134,10.1186/s12884-021-03583-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03583-1,,,,,,,,33588774,,,,,WOS:000620615500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Household overcrowding is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with migrants more likely to live in overcrowded households than UK-born individuals. We aimed to estimate the total effect of migration status on SARS-CoV-2 infection and to what extent household overcrowding mediated this effect. MethodsWe included a subcohort of individuals from the Virus Watch prospective cohort study during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave (1 September 2020-30 April 2021) who were aged & GE;18 years, self-reported the number of rooms in their household and had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection pre-September 2020. We estimated total, indirect and direct effects using Buis' logistic decomposition regression controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, clinical vulnerability, occupation, income and whether they lived with children. ResultsIn total, 23 478 individuals were included. 9.07% (187/2062) of migrants had evidence of infection during the study period vs 6.27% (1342/21 416) of UK-born individuals. Migrants had 22% higher odds of infection during the second wave (total effect; OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.47). Household overcrowding accounted for approximately 36% (95% CI -4% to 77%) of these increased odds (indirect effect, OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12; proportion accounted for: indirect effect on log odds scale/total effect on log odds scale=0.36). ConclusionMigrants had higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave compared with UK-born individuals and household overcrowding explained 36% of these increased odds.

However, sometimes this assumption can be disadvantageous, for example, when analyzing social media posts or moving objects. This article examines for the case of point geometries how a change from fixed to random spatial indexes affects inferences about global Moran's I, a popular spatial autocorrelation measure. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Matern and Thomas cluster processes are studied and for each of these processes, 10,000 random point patterns are simulated for investigating three aspects that are key in an inferential context: the null distributions of I when the underlying geometries are varied; the effect of the latter on critical values used to reject null hypotheses; and how the presence of point processes affects the statistical power of Moran's I. The results show that point processes affect all three characteristics. Inferences about spatial structure in relevant application contexts may therefore be different from conventional inferences when this additional source of randomness is taken into account.",,,,,"Westerholt, René/P-5634-2019","Westerholt, René/0000-0001-8228-3814",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7363,1538-4632,,,,2023 OCT,2023,55,4,,,,,621,650,,10.1111/gean.12349,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gean.12349,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000868926500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The automated annotation process can reduce users' cognitive overhead in tagging and improve tag management for better search, browsing, and recommendation of documents. It can be formulated as a multilabel classification problem. We propose a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels. The network separately models the title and the content of each document and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each sentence. To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption, which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics. The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN). We conducted a comprehensive evaluation study and compared JMAN to the state-of-the-art baseline models, using four large, real-world social media data sets. In terms of F-1, JMAN significantly outperformed bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) relatively by around 12.8%-78.6% and the hierarchical attention network (HAN) by around 3.9%-23.8%. The JMAN model demonstrates advantages in convergence and training speed. Further improvement of performance was observed against latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). When applying the semantic-based loss regularizers, the performance of HAN and Bi-GRU in terms of F-1 was also boosted. It is also found that dynamic update of the label semantic matrices (JMAN(d)) has the potential to further improve the performance of JMAN but at the cost of substantial memory and warrants further study.",,,,,"; Huang, Kaizhu/O-4721-2014","Dong, Hang/0000-0001-6828-6891; Huang, Kaizhu/0000-0002-3034-9639",,,,,,,,,,,,,2162-237X,2162-2388,,,,MAY,2021,32,5,,,,,2224,2238,,10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3002798,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3002798,,,,,,,,32584774,,,,,WOS:000647397200033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge, information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors, papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic ranking applications.",,,,,"Pensa, Ruggero G./B-5994-2011","Pensa, Ruggero G./0000-0001-5145-3438",,,,,,,,,,,,,0885-6125,1573-0565,,,,JUN,2020,109,6,,,,,1205,1229,,10.1007/s10994-019-05828-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-019-05828-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000542345400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the relationship between WRSM among the general population of emerging adults and various physical activity and screen time behaviors. This paper examines associations between WRSM app use and various forms of physical activity and screen time among a population-based sample of emerging adults. Data come from EAT 2018 (N = 1,568, mean age = 22.0 +/- 2.0 years), a population-based sample of emerging adults from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants reported on the types of WRSM apps used (physical activity and/or dietary focused), in addition to how much time they spent doing physical activity, whether they practiced yoga, compulsive exercise, recreational screen time, social media use, and whether they viewed dieting/weight loss materials. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess adjusted means and prevalences of outcomes. We found that physical activity-focused WRSM app users engaged in more hours of total (8.7 vs 7.2, P < .001), and moderate-to-vigorous (5.1 vs 4.3, P = .002) physical activity compared to non-users. Similar results were found for dietary WRSM app users compared to non-users. However, WRSM app users had higher levels of compulsive exercise and were more likely to view dieting/weight loss materials (Ps < .001).

J,"Warin, T",,,,"Warin, Thierry",,,Global Research on Coronaviruses: Metadata-Based Analysis for Public Health Policies,JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions. We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories: conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results: Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the United States and China were the primary contributors to global coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policy makers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for effective health responses.",,,,,"Warin, Thierry/G-9409-2016","Warin, Thierry/0000-0002-5921-3428",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2291-9694,,,,NOV,2021,9,11,,,,,,,e31510,10.2196/31510,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31510,,,,,,,,34596570,,,,,WOS:000738580700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks.SARS, MERS, swine flu, and COVID19.has demonstrated that the causative viruses were circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies chronologically from prehuman predictive technologies to population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally, as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks and pandemics.",,,,,"Mehta, Saurabh/L-8490-2017","Mehta, Saurabh/0000-0003-3788-0665; Oeschger, Taylor/0000-0001-8544-9656",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4842,1520-4898,,,,2021 OCT 5,2021,54,19,,,,,3656,3666,,10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00383,,SEP 2021,,,,,,34524795,,,,,WOS:000705964600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are millions of water pipe tobacco smokers worldwide, and in the United States, water pipe use is more common among youth and young adults than among adults. The spread of water pipe tobacco smoking has been abetted by the marketing of flavored tobacco, a social media environment that promotes water pipe smoking, and misperceptions about the addictive potential and potential adverse health effects of this form of tobacco use. There is growing evidence that water pipe tobacco smoking affects heart rate, blood pressure regulation, baroreflex sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, and vascular function over the short term. Long-term water pipe use is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. Several harmful or potentially harmful substances present in cigarette smoke are also present in water pipe smoke, often at levels exceeding those found in cigarette smoke. Water pipe tobacco smokers have a higher risk of initiation of cigarette smoking than never smokers. Future studies that focus on the long-term adverse health effects of intermittent water pipe tobacco use are critical to strengthen the evidence base and to inform the regulation of water pipe products and use. The objectives of this statement are to describe the design and operation of water pipes and their use patterns, to identify harmful and potentially harmful constituents in water pipe smoke, to document the cardiovascular risks of water pipe use, to review current approaches to water pipe smoking cessation, and to offer guidance to healthcare providers for the identification and treatment of individuals who smoke tobacco using water pipes.",,,,,"Goldstein, Larry/AGA-1247-2022; Maziak, Wasim/V-7567-2017; Thurston, George/ABB-1359-2021; , Thomas/AAD-4757-2020","Goldstein, Larry/0000-0001-7747-128X; Maziak, Wasim/0000-0001-6126-8420; Sutfin, Erin/0000-0003-2660-8383",,,,,,,,,,,,,0009-7322,1524-4539,,,,MAY 7,2019,139,19,,,,,E917,E936,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000671,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000671,,,,,,,,30845826,,,,,WOS:000469322900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Access to health information enables adolescents to make appropriate decisions. However, the relationship between access to health information through mass media and teenage pregnancy has not received much attention in existing literature. We therefore examined the association between access to mass media and teenage pregnancy in Zambia. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Zambia.

The objective of our study was to identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January 2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models and controlled for respondents' sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants. Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.02-3.79).

As web-based health information (WHI)-seeking affects health-related decision support and chronic symptom self-management, WHI-seeking from online sources may impact health care decisions and outcomes, including care-seeking decisions. Patients who are routinely connected to physicians are more likely to receive better and more consistent care. Little is known about whether WHI-seeking impacts the frequency at which patients engage with health care providers. Objective: Our primary objective was to describe the associations between the use of web-based methods to seek information about one's own health and the time since last engaging with a health care provider about one's own health. Additionally, we aimed to assess participants' trust in health care organizations to contextualize our findings. Methods: We analyzed data from US adults participating in the nationally representative Tufts Equity in Health, Wealth, and Civic Engagement Survey (N=1034). Bivariate associations between demographic characteristics and health information-seeking methods were assessed with Pearson chi-squared tests. Bivariate associations of Medical Mistrust Index (MMI) scores with each health information-seeking method and time since provider engagement were assessed with F tests and adjusted Wald tests. We fit a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the association between WHI-seeking within the 12 months prior to survey (alone or in combination with provider-based methods versus provider only) and engagement with a provider more than 1 year prior to the time of survey, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, education, insurance coverage, and MMI. Results: Age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance source, MMI, and time since provider engagement were each significantly associated with the health information-seeking method in bivariate analyses. Compared to using only provider-based health information seeking methods, WHI-based methods alone or in combination with provider-based methods were associated with a 51% lower likelihood (odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.87) of engaging with a provider within the previous year. Participants who used WHI-seeking methods alone and those who had not engaged with a health care provider within the previous year demonstrated a higher mean MMI score; however, MMI was not a significant predictor of time since engagement with a provider in the multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Our findings from a nationally representative survey suggest that for those who use WHI-seeking methods (alone or in combination with provider-based information-seeking methods), there is a statistically significant lower likelihood of engaging with a provider in a year compared to those who only use provider-based methods.

Results: A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years) responded, 23 (17.6%) had received training on infection control in ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75%), and 38.2% were not provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Most ophthalmologists (79.5%) thought that the virus could be detected in tears, and 72.2% thought that red eye as a symptom of COVID-19. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in Jordan were aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and related infection preventive measures. Knowledge was lacking regarding ocular aspects of the disease. Training on infection prevention needs to be improved. Access to guidelines from international ophthalmological organizations should be promoted and seeking updated literature from peer-reviewed journals needs to be encouraged.",,,,,"Jammal, Hisham/AAW-9323-2020; Khader, Yousef Saleh/AAE-9620-2019","Jammal, Hisham/0000-0002-1265-7224; Khader, Yousef Saleh/0000-0002-7830-6857; Alqudah, Noor/0000-0001-5341-9137",,,,,,,,,,,,,1177-5483,,,,,,2020,14,,,,,,2195,2202,,10.2147/OPTH.S260460,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S260460,,,,,,,,32801630,,,,,WOS:000555820400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is increasing evidence that patient-derived health data may contain information that complements traditional methods of clinical phenotyping. The utility of these data for defining meaningful phenotypic groups is of great interest because social media and online resources make it possible to query large cohorts of patients with health conditions. Methods We evaluated the degree to which patient-reported categorical data is useful for discovering subclinical phenotypes and evaluated its utility for discovering new measures of disease severity, treatment response and genetic architecture. Specifically, we examined the responses of 1961 patients with inflammatory bowel disease to questionnaires in search of sub-phenotypes. We applied machine learning methods to identify novel subtypes of Crohn's disease and studied their associations with drug responses. Results Using the patients' self-reported information, we identified two subpopulations of Crohn's disease; these subpopulations differ in disease severity, associations with smoking, and genetic transmission patterns. We also identified distinct features of drug response for the two Crohn's disease subtypes. These subtypes show a trend towards differential genotype signatures.

Changes to behavior during an outbreak limit the reliability of syndromic surveillance using large-scale data sources, such as online social media or search behavior, which could otherwise supplement healthcarebased outbreak-prediction methods. Here, we measure behavior change reflected in mobile-phone call-detail records (CDRs), a source of passively collected real-time behavioral information, using an anonymously linked dataset of cell-phone users and their date of influenza-like illness diagnosis during the 2009 H1N1v pandemic. We demonstrate that mobile-phone use during illness differs measurably from routine behavior: Diagnosed individuals exhibit less movement than normal (1.1 to 1.4 fewer unique tower locations; P < 3.2 x 10(-3)), on average, in the 2 to 4 d around diagnosis and place fewer calls (2.3 to 3.3 fewer calls; P < 5.6 x 10(-4)) while spending longer on the phone (41- to 66-s average increase; P < 4.6 x 10(-10)) than usual on the day following diagnosis.

Limited resources and human response to crises can lead members of local communities to turn to one another to fulfil immediate needs. This spontaneous citizen-led response can be crucial to a community's ability to cope in a crisis. It is thus essential to understand the scope of such initiatives so that support can be provided where it is most needed. Nevertheless, quickly developing situations and varying definitions can make the community response challenging to measure. Aim To create an accessible interactive map of the citizen-led community response to need during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, UK that combines information gathered from multiple data providers to reflect different interpretations of need and support. Approach We gathered data from a combination of official data providers and community-generated sources to create 14 variables representative of need and support. These variables are derived by a reproducible data pipeline that enables flexible integration of new data. The interactive tool is available online (www.covidresponsemap.wales) and can map available data at two geographic resolutions. Users choose their variables of interest, and interpretation of the map is aided by a linked bee-swarm plot. Discussion The novel approach we developed enables people at all levels of community response to explore and analyse the distribution of need and support across Wales. While there can be limitations to the accuracy of community-generated data, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used alongside traditional data sources to maximise the understanding of community action. This adds to our overall aim to measure community response and resilience, as well as to make complex population health data accessible to a range of audiences.

Self-harm incidents not only cause loss to individuals but also incur a negative impact on the nation's economy. Studies have demonstrated an increase in trends of self-harm that are correlated with the emergence of technological advancements and swift urban expansion in developing countries. The capacity to nowcast and forecast national-level patterns of self-harm trends could be imperative to policymakers and stakeholders in the public health sector, as it would enable them to implement prompt measures to counteract the underlying factors or avert these projected calamities. Prior research has utilized historical data to predict self-harm trends at the population level in various nations using conventional statistical forecasting methods. However, in some countries, such historical statistics may be challenging to obtain or insufficient for accurate prediction, impeding the ability to comprehend and project the national self-harm landscape in a timely manner. This paper proposes FAST, a framework designed to forecast self-harm patterns at the national level by analyzing mental signals obtained from a large volume of social media data. These signals serve as a proxy for real-world population mental health that could be used to enhance the forecastability of self-harm trends. Specifically, language-agnostic language models are first trained to extract different mental signals from collected social media messages. Then, these signals are aggregated and processed into multi-variate time series, on which the time-delay embedding algorithm is applied to transform into temporal embedded instances. Finally, various machine learning regressors are validated for their forecastability. The proposed method is validated through a case study in Thailand, which utilizes a set of 12 mental signals extracted from tweets to forecast death and injury cases resulting from self-harm. The results show that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ARIMA baseline by 43.56% and 36.48% on average in terms of MAPE on forecasting death and injury cases from self-harm, respectively. As far as current understanding permits, our research represents the initial exploration of utilizing aggregated social media information for the purposes of nowcasting and forecasting trends of self-harm on a nationwide scale. The results not only provide insight into improved forecasting techniques for self-harm trends but also establish a foundation for forthcoming social-network-driven applications that hinge on the capacity to predict socioeconomic factors.",,,,,,"Tuarob, Suppawong/0000-0002-5201-5699",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2023,11,,,,,,64796,64814,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289295,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001024151700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This mental health burden has also been fueled by an infodemic: an information overload that includes misinformation and disinformation. Suicide, the worst mental health outcome, is a serious public health problem that can be prevented with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Suicide ideation, one important risk factor for suicide, is thus important to measure and monitor, as are the factors that may impact on it. Objective: This investigation had 2 primary aims: (1) to estimate and compare country-specific prevalence of suicide ideation at 2 different time points, overall and by gender and age groups, and (2) to investigate the influence of sociodemographic and infodemic variables on suicide ideation. Methods: A repeated, online, 8-country (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, and New Zealand), cross-sectional study was undertaken with adults aged 18 years, with measurement wave 1 conducted from May 29, 2020 to June 12, 2020 and measurement wave 2 conducted November 6-18, 2021. Self-reported suicide ideation was derived from item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Age-standardized suicide ideation rates were reported, a binomial regression model was used to estimate suicide ideation indication rates for each country and measurement wave, and logistic regression models were then employed to relate sociodemographic, pandemic, and infodemic variables to suicide ideation. Results: The final sample totaled 17,833 adults: 8806 (49.4%) from measurement wave 1 and 9027 (50.6%) from wave 2. Overall, 24.2% (2131/8806) and 27.5% (2486/9027) of participants reported suicide ideation at measurement waves 1 and 2, respectively, a difference that was significant (P<.001). Considerable variability was observed in suicide ideation age-standardized rates between countries, ranging from 15.6% in Belgium (wave 1) to 42.9% in Hong Kong (wave 2). Frequent social media usage was associated with increased suicide ideation at wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.25-1.72; P<.001) but not wave 1 (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96-1.23; P=.16). However, having a weaker sense of coherence (SOC; AOR 3.80, 95% CI 3.18-4.55 at wave 1 and AOR 4.39, 95% CI 3.66-5.27 at wave 2; both P<.001) had the largest overall effect size. Conclusions: Suicide ideation is prevalent and significantly increasing over time in this COVID-19 pandemic era, with considerable variability between countries. Younger adults and those residing in Hong Kong carried disproportionately higher rates. Social media appears to have an increasingly detrimental association with suicide ideation, although having a stronger SOC had a larger protective effect. Policies and promotion of SOC, together with disseminating health information that explicitly tackles the infodemic's misinformation and disinformation, may importantly reduce the rising mental health morbidity and mortality triggered by this pandemic.",,,,,"Walther, Cordula/HNI-7449-2023; Hung, Kevin KC/H-8327-2016","Hung, Kevin KC/0000-0001-8706-7758; Landaverde, Elsa/0000-0001-5036-5807; Schluter, Philip/0000-0001-6799-6779",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,JAN,2022,8,1,,,,,,,e32140,10.2196/32140,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32140,,,,,,,,34727524,,,,,WOS:000749005400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: We analyzed data from the Care, Health and Ageing of Russian-speaking Minority (CHARM) study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling, Russian-speaking adults aged 50 years or older residing permanently in Finland (men: 616/1082, 56.93%; age: mean 63.2 years, SD 8.4 years; response rate: 1082/3000, 36.07%). Data were collected in 2019 using a postal survey. Health was measured using depressive symptoms (measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and SRH. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the two health indicators and the following six outcomes: daily internet use, smartphone ownership, the use of the internet for messages and calls, social media use, the use of the internet for personal health data, and obtaining health information from the internet. A number of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the logistic regression regression analysis. Analyses were performed with weights accounting for the survey design and nonresponse. Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.37-5.24; P=.004) and poor SRH (OR 7.90, 95% CI 1.88-33.11; P=.005) were associated with a higher likelihood of not using the internet daily. Depressive symptoms (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35; P=.03) and poor SRH (OR 5.05, 95% CI 1.58-16.19; P=.006) also increased the likelihood of smartphone nonuse. Depressive symptoms were additionally associated with a lower likelihood of social media use, and poor SRH was associated with a lower likelihood of using the internet for messaging and calling. Conclusions: Poor SRH and depressive symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of DIT use in older adults. Longitudinal studies are required to determine the directions of these relationships.",,,,,"Kemppainen, Laura/GQH-7785-2022; Kemppainen, Laura/AAZ-3907-2021","Kemppainen, Laura/0000-0001-9320-2442; Ketonen, Eeva-Leena/0000-0003-1053-2097; Kouvonen, Anne/0000-0001-6997-8312; Kemppainen, Teemu/0000-0002-0450-4439; Wrede, Sirpa/0000-0001-7358-2097; Olakivi, Antero/0000-0002-7011-8536",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUN 14,2021,23,6,,,,,,,e20988,10.2196/20988,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20988,,,,,,,,34125069,,,,,WOS:000663238300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0.0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5.2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

Although YouTube has advantages in this context, there are potential dangers as videos may contain nonscientific, misleading, or even harmful information. Objective: As little is known about YouTube as a source of information on atopic dermatitis (AD), we investigated the content-related quality of AD videos and their perception among YouTube users. Methods: The quality of the 100 most viewed AD videos was assessed by using the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and the DISCERN instrument. Videos were classified as useful, misleading, and potentially harmful, and the correlations of viewers' ratings (likes) with the GQS and DISCERN scores were assessed. Results: Among the 100 videos, 68.0% (68/100) and 62.0% (62/100) were of poor and very poor scientific quality, respectively. Additionally, 32.0% (32/100) of the videos were classified as useful, 48.0% (48/100) were classified as misleading, and 34.0% (34/100) were classified as potentially harmful. Viewers' ratings did not correlate with the GQS and DISCERN scores. Overall, 50.0% (50/100) of the videos were posted by private individuals and promoters of complementary/alternative treatments, 42.0% (42/100) by therapeutical advertisers, and only 8.0% (8/100) by nonprofit organizations/universities. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that two-thirds of the videos analyzed were below acceptable medical quality standards and that many videos were disseminating misleading or even dangerous content. Subjective and anecdotal content was over-represented, and viewers did not appear to be able to distinguish between high- and low-quality videos.

The disease is characterised by mucosal inflammation and localised fibrosis resulting in life-threatening blockage of the upper airway. Because of high recurrence rates, patients with iSGS will frequently require multiple procedures following their initial diagnosis. Both the disease and its therapies profoundly affect patients' ability to breathe, communicate and swallow. A variety of treatments have been advanced to manage this condition. However, comparative data on effectiveness and side effects of the unique approaches have never been systematically evaluated. This study will create an international, multi-institutional prospective cohort of patients with iSGS. It will compare three surgical approaches to determine how well the most commonly used treatments in iSGS 'work' and what quality of life (QOL) trade-offs are associated with each approach. Methods and analysis A prospective pragmatic trial comparing the 'Standard of Care' for iSGS at multiple international institutions. Patients with a diagnosis of iSGS without clinical or laboratory evidence of vasculitis or a history of endotracheal intubation 2 years prior to symptom onset will be included in the study. Prospective evaluation of disease recurrence requiring operative intervention, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as well as patient-generated health data (mobile peak flow recordings and daily steps taken) will be longitudinally tracked for 36 months. The primary endpoint is treatment effectiveness defined as time to recurrent operative procedure. Secondary endpoints relate to treatment side effects and include PRO measures in voice, swallowing, breathing and global QOL as well as patient-generated health data. Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the local IRB Committee of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in July 2015. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and directly to patient with iSGS via social media-based support groups.",,,,,"Gelbard, Alexander/K-1976-2014; Daniero, James Joseph/AFH-8000-2022","Gelbard, Alexander/0000-0003-0078-1305; Daniero, James Joseph/0000-0003-3693-4617; Garrett, Catherine Gaelyn/0000-0002-3434-8844; Netterville, James/0000-0002-7282-8769; Shyr, Yu/0000-0003-2086-9670",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,APR,2018,8,4,,,,,,,e022243,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022243,,,,,,,,29643170,,,,,WOS:000435176700248,View Full Record in Web of Science

Improving awareness about NTDs is a powerful affordable long-term intervention for infection control. In literature, there is a limited number of studies in the developing countries assessing the awareness of healthcare providers regarding these diseases. The present study aimed at assessing the awareness of a sample of Cairo University medical and nursing students regarding NTDs. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 184 medical and nursing students in Cairo University. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire in English language with an estimated completion time of 15 minutes was used for evaluation. It included question categories which cover the knowledge about NTDs and control measures as well as the willingness to participate in NTDs control activities. Content analysis was performed on the materials and specifications of the epidemiology course given to medical and nursing students. Out of the study participants, 26% knew the meaning of NTDs. The main source of their knowledge was social media followed by the epidemiology course. A percentage of 33% of the students agreed that NTDs are of public health importance in Egypt. Thirty four percent of the participants expressed their willingness to participate in control activities for NTDs. Comparing medical and nursing students, a higher percentage of the nursing students stated that NTDs are causing a public health problem in Egypt with a statistically significant difference (P value < 0.001), while a statistically significant higher percentage of medical students believed that the awareness level regarding NTDs in Egypt is low (P value = 0.002). Cairo University medical and nursing students in this study showed a gap in the level of knowledge regarding NTDs and their control activities which represents a great threat to the control of these diseases. Author summary Egypt vision 2030 aiming that all Egyptians should have healthy, safe, and secure life. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Egypt has the highest rate of NTDs. Current medical and nursing students are the future healthcare workers who will be responsible to participate in control activities for the elimination of these diseases in Egypt. The present study aimed to provide information about the awareness of medical and nursing students regarding NTDs and their control activities. We targeted medical and nursing students who have finished an epidemiology course. Our results showed that only one fourth of the students knew the meaning of NTDs and nearly half of them agreed that the awareness of NTDs is poor among Egyptians. Although only 5% of the included students are aware of NTDs control activities, about one third of them agreed to participate in these activities. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to update the curricula of medical students in Egypt, especially because of the new program the medical schools in Egypt are experiencing currently (five years of studying and two years for training). Also, the engagement of medical and nursing students in research and prevention activities to combat NTDs should be encouraged in the training years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1935-2735,,,,,NOV,2020,14,11,,,,,,,e0008826,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008826,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008826,,,,,,,,33206641,,,,,WOS:000595265400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods A YouTube search was performed on https://www.youtube.com/for videos pertaining to retinopathy of prematurity and ROP. The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. Two ophthalmologist reviewers independently evaluated and classified the videos as useful or misleading. The videos were accepted as useful, if they provide scientifically correct information about any aspect of ROP: cause, pathogenesis, symptoms, findings, treatments, procedure details of the treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis. The videos contain scientifically unproven information are defined as misleading. Videos were also classified according to the source: surgeon/practitioner, independent user, hospital/free clinic, social media/TV, medical site, university, and advertisement. Results The mean duration, the mean days on YouTube, the mean comments per videos, and the mean dislikes per video were similar in useful and misleading videos. However, the mean likes per day, mean view per video, and mean view per day were significantly higher in useful videos than those of misleading videos (p = 0.004, p = 0.022, and p = 0.011, respectively). Most of the useful videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals including source from university, hospital/free clinic, and surgeon/practitioner (48/64).

Successfully control and minimization of related morbidity and mortality require changing the behavior, which is influenced by knowledge and perceptions. This study aimed to explore the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of medical students (MS) regarding COVID-19 and to identify their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 431 ungraduated MS was conducted in Sfax Medical School, Southern Tunisia, in November 2020. Results: The global scores of COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice among MS were 74.6 +/- 13, 69 +/- 10.2, and 78.8 +/- 13.6/100, respectively. Prevalence of good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice was 47.1%, 19.3%, and 61.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the independent factors of good knowledge were current smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.8; p=0.04), assistance to training sessions (AOR=1.5; p=0.04) and specialized residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.02). History of chronic disease was an independant predictor of positive attitude (AOR=2.4; p=0.009), while current smoking (AOR=0.4; p=0.01) wasindependantly associated with negative attitude. Social media used as a main source of information about COVID-19 was independently associated with poor knowledge (AOR=0.5; p=0.01) and negative attitude (AOR=0.4; p=0.008). Independant factors of good practice were specialized residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.01), being in close contact exposure with COVID-19 cases (AOR= 2.1; p=0.04) and having good knowledge (AOR=2.2; p < 0.001).

In addition, we conducted a manual search of gray literature.ResultsA total of 4690 records were identified. After duplicate removal and full-text assessment, 14 articles were examined. Our findings indicate that children and adolescents may often be exposed to alcohol advertisements on social media and websites due to industry's self-regulatory age-affirmation systems being largely ineffective at preventing under-aged access. Cases of self-regulatory violations by the alcohol industry, and increasingly innovative 'gray-area' advertising approaches have also been noted. Additionally, research illustrates a lack of developed statutory restrictions of digital alcohol advertising and instead continued reliance on voluntary industry self-regulation.ConclusionsThere is a substantial need for further research to examine the effectiveness of digital alcohol advertising restrictions in social media, websites and image/video sharing platforms.

Methods Using snowball sampling, the Families' Importance in Nursing Care-Nurses' Attitudes questionnaire was initially administered to a broad, convenience sample of Danish registered nurses through social media: Facebook interest groups and the homepage of the Danish Family Nursing Association. These nurses were encouraged to send the invitation to participate in their network of nursing colleagues. Complete data sets from 1,720 nurses were available for analysis. Results In general, the nurses considered the family as important in patient care. Nurses who held master's and doctorate degrees scored significantly higher than nurses with a basic nursing education. Nurses who had had experience with illness within their own families tended to score higher on the family as a conversational partner subscale than those without this experience. Nurses with the longest engagement within hospital settings scored significantly lower than those with the longest engagement within primary health care and/or psychiatry. Conclusions Families are considered important in nursing care. Younger nurses with a basic education, short-term engagement at a hospital and no experiences with illness within their own families were predictors of less supportive attitudes towards including the family in nursing care.

We have started a registry to determine the burden, phenotype, risk factors, disease course and outcomes of IBD in Zimbabwe. Methods and analysis A prospective observational registry with a nested case-control study has been established at a tertiary hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. The registry is recruiting confirmed IBD cases from the hospital, and other facilities throughout Zimbabwe. Demographic and clinical data are obtained at baseline, 6 months and annually. Two age and sex-matched non-IBD controls per case are recruited-a sibling or second-degree relative, and a randomly selected individual from the same neighbourhood. Cases and controls are interviewed for potential risk factors of IBD, and dietary intake using a food frequency questionnaire. Stool is collected for 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling, and along with germline DNA from peripheral blood, is being biobanked. The estimated sample size is 86 cases and 172 controls, and the overall registry is anticipated to run for at least 5 years. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographic and phenotypic characteristics of IBD, and incidence and prevalence will be estimated for Harare. Risk factors for IBD will be analysed using conditional logistic regression. For microbial analysis, alpha diversity and beta diversity will be compared between cases and controls, and between IBD phenotypes. Mann-Whitney U tests for alpha diversity and Adonis (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) for beta diversity will be computed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Parirenyatwa Hospital's and University of Zimbabwe's research ethics committee and the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe. Findings will be discussed with patients, and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health.

High penetration of smartphone usage and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in PLWH in China. Methods: A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects. Discussion: The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective, Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic diseases.",,,,,"Zeng, Chengbo/HGD-0355-2022; Zeng, Chengbo/AAU-1517-2020; Qiao, Jiaying/GWZ-5827-2022; yang, cui/E-7403-2012; cai, wei/JPY-3260-2023","Qiao, Jiaying/0000-0003-1171-5098; Hong, Y.

Observational studies can aid our understanding of the impact of health and structural oppression based on the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity, age and other factors, as they frequently collect this data. However, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline, does not provide guidance related to reporting of health equity. The goal of this project is to develop a STROBE-Equity reporting guideline extension.MethodsWe assembled a diverse team across multiple domains, including gender, age, ethnicity, Indigenous background, disciplines, geographies, lived experience of health inequity and decision-making organizations. Using an inclusive, integrated knowledge translation approach, we will implement a five-phase plan which will include: (1) assessing the reporting of health equity in published observational studies, (2) seeking wide international feedback on items to improve reporting of health equity, (3) establishing consensus amongst knowledge users and researchers, (4) evaluating in partnership with Indigenous contributors the relevance to Indigenous peoples who have globally experienced the oppressive legacy of colonization, and (5) widely disseminating and seeking endorsement from relevant knowledge users. We will seek input from external collaborators using social media, mailing lists and other communication channels.DiscussionAchieving global imperatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDG 10 Reduced inequalities, SDG 3 Good health and wellbeing) requires advancing health equity in research. The implementation of the STROBE-Equity guidelines will enable a better awareness and understanding of health inequities through better reporting. We will broadly disseminate the reporting guideline with tools to enable adoption and use by journal editors, authors, and funding agencies, using diverse strategies tailored to specific audiences.",,,,,"Chamberlain, Catherine R/A-4218-2013; Pottie, Kevin/ABC-4385-2020; Dewidar, Omar/AEI-7649-2022; Cuervo Amore, Luis Gabriel Cuervo/A-9464-2009; Ramke, Jacqueline/I-8844-2019; Kristjansson, Elizabeth/AAT-9709-2020; Magwood, Olivia/IST-7319-2023; Akl, Elie/K-5269-2019; Rader, Tamara/H-9469-2013","Dewidar, Omar/0000-0001-6420-887X; Cuervo Amore, Luis Gabriel Cuervo/0000-0003-2732-5019; Ramke, Jacqueline/0000-0002-5764-1306; Magwood, Olivia/0000-0003-0262-5621; Pottie, Kevin/0000-0002-1874-8346; Okwen, Patrick/0000-0002-9017-7496; Chamberlain, Catherine/0000-0003-3446-0227; Craig, Peter/0000-0002-7653-5832; Sharma Waddington, Hugh/0000-0003-3859-3342; Wasif, Muhammad/0009-0004-1374-302X; Kasonde, Mwenya/0000-0001-8608-8493; Pantoja, Tomas/0000-0002-5473-3053",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1475-9276,,,,MAR 30,2023,22,1,,,,,,,55,10.1186/s12939-023-01854-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-023-01854-1,,,,,,,,36991403,,,,,WOS:000963566400001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Macnaughton, J",,,,"Macnaughton, Jane",,,Does medical humanities matter? The challenge of COVID-19,MEDICAL HUMANITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Medical humanities has tended first and foremost to be associated with the ways in which the arts and humanities help us to understand health. However, this is not the only or necessarily the primary aim of our field. What the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed above all is what the field of critical medical humanities has insisted on: the deep entanglement of social, cultural, historical life with the biomedical. The pandemic has been a time for reinstating the power of expertise of a particular kind, focusing on epidemiology, scientific modelling of potential outcomes and vaccine development. All of this delivered by science at speed.It has been challenging for medical humanities researchers to find purchase in these debates with insights from our more contemplative, 'slow research' approaches. However, as the height of the crisis passes, our field might now be coming into its own. The pandemic, as well as being productive of scientific expertise, also demonstrated clearly the meaning of culture: that it is not a static entity, but is produced and evolves through interaction and relationship. Taking a longer view, we can see the emergence of a certain 'COVID-19 culture' characterised by entanglements between expert knowledge, social media, the economy, educational progress, risk to health services and people in their socio-economic, political ethnic and religious/spiritual contexts. It is the role of medical humanities to pay attention to those interactions and to examine how they play out in the human experience and potential impact of the pandemic. However, to survive and grow in significance within the field of healthcare research, we need to engage not just to comment. There is a need for medical humanities scholars to assert our expertise in interdisciplinary research, fully engaged with experts by experience, and to work proactively with funders to demonstrate our value.",,,,,,"Macnaughton, Jane/0000-0002-7289-4037",,,,,,,,,,,,,1468-215X,1473-4265,,,,2023 DEC,2023,49,4,,,,,545,552,,10.1136/medhum-2022-012602,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medhum-2022-012602,,JUN 2023,,,,,,37268405,,,,,WOS:001004819000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrating injury epidemiology theory and big data technology, we developed a data platform consisting of four layers (data acquisition, data processing, application and data storage) to automatically collect reports from online Chinese media concerning road traffic crashes every 24 h. We built a text classification model using 20,000 manually annotated news stories based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and then used natural language processing algorithms to extract data concerning 27 structured variables from the news sources. The accuracy of the BERT-based text classification model was 0.9271, with information extraction accuracy exceeding 80% for 22 variables. As of November 30, 2021, the data platform collected 244,650 eligible media reports covering all 333 prefecture-level divisions in China. These reports were from 37,073 websites or social media accounts, which were geographically located in all 31 provinces and over 98% of prefecture-level divisions. Data availability varied greatly from 0.9% to 100% across the 27 structured variables. Additionally, the platform identified 645,787 potentially relevant keywords when applying natural language processing techniques to the textual media reports. Platform data were highly correlated with road police data in province-based road traffic crash statistics (crashes, r(s) = 0.799; non-fatal injuries, r(s) = 0.802; deaths, r(s) = 0.775). In particular, the platform offers valuable data (like crashes involving electric vehicles) that are not included in official mad traffic crash statistics. The new automated data platform shows great potential for timely detection of emerging characteristics of mad traffic crashes. Further research is needed to improve the platform and apply it to real-time monitoring and analysis of road traffic injuries.",,,,,"Schwebel, David C./GXH-9944-2022; Cheng, Yuan/JKJ-0794-2023","Schwebel, David C./0000-0002-2141-8970;",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4575,1879-2057,,,,2022 SEP,2022,174,,,,,,,,106727,10.1016/j.aap.2022.106727,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2022.106727,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35667199,,,,,WOS:000832781400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The condition has been associated with several preventable risk factors. Objective: The objective of this study is to calculate the prevalence of dry eye and determine the associated risk factors among adults and children in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study targeting all Saudi populations, including all the regions of Saudi Arabia. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the five-item Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ-5) were used for data collection. Data were collected using an online form that was distributed through social media. Results: A total of 541 responses were analyzed. The OSDI scores showed that females represented 70.9%, and the age group of 20-40 years represented 59.7%. The prevalence of DED, including all severity levels, was 74.9%. The distribution across levels was as follows: mild cases at 26.2%, moderate cases at 18.2%, and severe at 30.4%. On the other hand, DEQ-5 has shown a prevalence of 37% among the pediatric age group. Several risk factors have been significantly associated with adults' dry eye, including low humidity (Pvalue=0.002), reading, driving, or watching electronic screens for extended durations (P-value=0.019), autoimmune diseases (P-value=0.033), and undergoing eye procedures (P-value-0.013). Conclusion: The current study reports a high prevalence rate of dry eyes among the Saudi population.

Despite several measures undertaken to limit the socio-economic effect of coronavirus, various challenges remain pervasive, and one such challenge is mental health, particularly depression and anxiety. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out via social media platforms and 1544 Malaysians were selected. The level of depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9) and scored accordingly for categorization. Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used as a self-assessment survey to quantify the level of anxiety of persons experiencing anxiety-related symptoms. Percentage distribution and logistic regression analysis were used in the data analysis. Results: Results showed that one-fourth (25.1%) of the participants had severe depressive symptoms. Almost one sixth (18.7%) had mild depressive symptoms and one-third (34.1%) had mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. Age, gender, and friends infected with virus were the three important predictors of depression and anxiety. The odds of having depression (OR = 1.44; C.I. = 1.32-1.62) and anxiety (OR = 1.36; C.I. = 1.27-1.47) were significantly higher among females than in males.

Although Nigeria implemented a COVID-19 vaccination program on 15 March 2021, low vaccine acceptance remains a major challenge. To provide insight on factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), we conducted a national survey among healthcare workers, academics, and tertiary students, between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2021. We fitted a logistic regression model to the data and examined factors associated with VH to support targeted health awareness campaigns to address public concerns and improve vaccination rates on par with global efforts. A total of 1525 respondents took part in the survey, composed of healthcare-workers (24.5%, 373/1525), academics (26.9%, 410/1525), and students (48.7%, 742/1525). Only 29% (446/1525) of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of this study. Of the 446 vaccinated respondents, 35.7% (159/446), 61.4% (274/446) and 2.9% (13/446) had one, two and three or more doses, respectively. Reasons for VH included: difficulty in the vaccination request/registration protocols (21.3%, 633/1079); bad feelings towards the vaccines due to negative social media reports/rumours (21.3%, 633/1079); personal ideology/religious beliefs against vaccination (16.7%, 495/1079); and poor confidence that preventive measures were enough to protect against COVID-19 (11%, 323/1079). Some health concerns that deterred unvaccinated respondents were: innate immunity issues (27.7%, 345/1079); allergic reaction concerns (24.6%, 307/1079); and blood clot problems in women (21.4%, 266/1079). In the multivariable model, location of respondents/geopolitical zones, level of education, testing for COVID-19, occupation/job description and religion were significantly associated with VH.

Data for this study came from a sample of African Americans (N = 304) who responded to an online survey. Perceptions of mental health were assessed using a single item developed by the research team. Exposure to police brutality and protests was measured by asking how often they had seen or heard about African Americans being victims of police brutality and seen or heard about protests on television, social media, or other outlets. Participants were also asked about the extent to which these events caused them emotional distress. Social activism was assessed by asking participants if they had ever participated in political activities, such as calling their representative. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted using linear regression. Moderation analyses showed that greater emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and protests was associated with worse perceptions of mental health only when engagement in social activism was low. In contrast, mediation analyses indicated that greater frequency of and emotional distress from exposure to media coverage was indirectly associated with worse perceptions of mental health through increased engagement in social activism.

A perspective on technology fit and social capital,DIGITAL HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"IntroductionWith the widespread use of mobile devices and the rapid development of mobile networks, connecting mobile personal health record (mPHR) apps to wearable devices to collect personal health data for analysis and community activities has become a trend for health promotion. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the vital factors that impact the sustained usage of mPHR apps. ObjectiveIn this study, we identified social lock-in as a major research gap in the current era of social media and the Internet. Therefore, to explore the effects of mPHR apps on continued app usage intention, we combined technology fit (individual-technology, synchronicity-technology, and task-technology fit) and social capital (structural, relational, and cognitive capital) to develop a novel study model. MethodsThe purpose of this research is to investigate the willingness to participate in the mPHR apps. It collected 565 valid users' responses through the online questionnaire with a structural equation modeling approach. ResultsThat technology and social lock-in significantly affected the willingness of users to continue using mPHR apps (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) and that the effects of social lock-in (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) were more pronounced than those of technology lock-in (beta = 0.22, P < 0.001).

Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed to capture the demographics, disease characteristics, healthcare use, informal care, employment, and wellbeing. Referencing international studies, standardized survey instruments were included (e.g. CSRI, MFIS-5, EQ-5D) or adapted (EDSS) for inclusion in an online survey platform. Recruitment was directed at people with MS via the MS Society mailing list and social media platforms, as well as in traditional media. The economic costing was primarily conducted using a bottom-up' methodology, and national estimates were achieved using prevalence-based' extrapolation. Results: A total of 594 people completed the survey in full. The sample had geographic, disease, and demographic characteristics indicating good representativeness. At an individual level, average societal cost was estimated at (sic)47,683; the average annual costs for those with mild, moderate, and severe MS were calculated as (sic)34,942, (sic)57,857, and (sic)100,554, respectively. For a total Irish MS population of 9,000, the total societal costs of MS amounted to (sic)429m. Direct costs accounted for just 30% of the total societal costs, indirect costs amounted to 50% of the total, and intangible or QoL costs represented 20%. The societal cost associated with a relapse in the sample is estimated as (sic)2,438. Limitations and conclusions: The findings highlight that up to 70% of the total costs associated with MS are not routinely counted. These hidden costs are higher in Ireland than the rest of Europe, due in part to significantly lower levels of workforce participation, a higher likelihood of permanent workforce withdrawal, and higher levels of informal care needs. The relationship between disease progression and costs emphasize the societal importance of managing and slowing the progression of the illness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-6998,1941-837X,,,,,2018,21,5,,,,,425,437,,10.1080/13696998.2018.1427100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2018.1427100,,,,,,,,29320900,,,,,WOS:000430213400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little research exists describing vaginal health after the initial recovery from surgery, and evidence-based guidelines for vaginal care practices are unavailable.Aim The study sought to describe self-reported gynecological concerns and vaginal care practices among transfeminine persons who have undergone vaginoplasty.Methods A total of 60 transfeminine participants 18+ years of age, living in Canada, and who had undergone vaginoplasty at least 1 year prior were recruited through social media, community groups, healthcare provider referrals, and study recontact. Participants completed a cross-sectional, online questionnaire detailing demographics, gynecological concerns, and genital practices and exposures. Hierarchical clustering was used to group participants based on behavioral practices and exposures. Associations between clusters and gynecological concerns were assessed.Outcomes Outcomes included self-reported gynecological concerns within the past year, recent vulvar or vaginal symptoms (past 30 days), and behavioral practices/exposures, including douching with varied products and dilating.Results Participants reported a variety of concerns in the past year, including urinary tract infection (13%) and internal hair regrowth (23%). More than half (57%) had experienced at least 1 recent vaginal symptom, most commonly malodor (27%) and vaginal bleeding (21%). Of participants, 48% were dilating weekly and 52% reported douching in the past 30 days. Four distinct clusters of vaginal practices/exposures were identified: limited exposures; dilating, no douching; dilating and douching; and diverse exposures. No significant associations between cluster membership and gynecological concerns were identified, though cluster membership was significantly associated with surgical center (P = .03). Open-text write-ins provided descriptions of symptoms and symptom management strategies.Clinical Implications The results provide insight for clinicians on common patient-reported gynecological concerns and current vaginal care practices and exposures, including symptom management strategies.Strengths and Limitations This was the first study to investigate vaginal health and genital practices/exposures among a community sample of transfeminine individuals. As participants self-enrolled for a detailed survey and swab collection, individuals experiencing concerns were likely overrepresented.Conclusion Transfeminine individuals reported a range of gynecological concerns outside of the surgical healing period. Genital practices/exposures varied across clusters, but no clear associations between clusters and symptoms were identified; instead, practice/exposure clusters were dependent on where the individual underwent vaginoplasty.

We aimed to estimate the total effect of occupation on SARS-CoV-2 serological status, whether this is mediated by workplace close contact, and how exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces varied across occupations. Methods We used data from a subcohort (n=3775) of adults in the UK-based Virus Watch cohort study who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (indicating natural infection). We used logistic decomposition to investigate the relationship between occupation, contact and seropositivity, and logistic regression to investigate exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces. Results Seropositivity was 17.1% among workers with daily close contact vs 10.0% for those with no work-related close contact. Compared with other professional occupations, healthcare, indoor trade/process/plant, leisure/personal service, and transport/mobile machine workers had elevated adjusted total odds of seropositivity (1.80 (1.03 to 3.14) - 2.46 (1.82 to 3.33)). Work-related contact accounted for a variable part of increased odds across occupations (1.04 (1.01 to 1.08) - 1.23 (1.09 to 1.40)). Occupations with raised odds of infection after accounting for work-related contact also had greater exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces.

MSM in China are a high-risk group for HBV and HCV infection, but test uptake is low. Crowdsourcing invites a large group to solve a problem and then shares the solution with the public. This nationwide online randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention to increase HBV and HCV testing among MSM in China. Methods: Seven hundred MSM will be recruited through social media operated by MSM organizations in China. Eligible participants will be born biologically male, age 16 years or older, report previous anal sex with another man, and reside in China. After completing a baseline online survey, participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will include two components: (1) a multimedia component will deliver two videos and two images promoting HBV and HCV testing developed through a crowdsourcing contest in China; (2) a participatory component will invite men to submit suggestions for how to improve crowdsourced videos and images. The control arm will not view any images or videos and will not be invited to submit suggestions. All participants will be offered reimbursement for HBV and HCV testing costs. The primary outcome is HBV and HCV test uptake confirmed through electronic submission of test report photos within four weeks of enrolment. Secondary outcomes include self-reported HBV and HCV test uptake, HBV vaccination uptake, and change in stigma toward people living with HBV after four weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated using intention to treat and as-exposed analyses and compared using two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Discussion: Few previous studies have evaluated interventions to increase HBV and HCV testing in middle-income countries with a high burden of hepatitis. Delivering a crowdsourced intervention using social media is a novel approach to increasing hepatitis testing rates.

Such research draws on a range of clinical and non-clinical data to make predictions about health risks, such as identifying epidemics and monitoring disease spread. Much of this research uses data from social media in the public domain or anonymous secondary health data and is therefore exempt from ethics committee scrutiny. While the ethical use and regulation of digital-based research has been discussed, little attention has been given to the ethics governance of such research in higher education institutions in the field of population health. Such governance is essential to how scholars make ethical decisions and provides assurance to the public that researchers are acting ethically. We propose a process of ethics governance for population health research in higher education institutions. The approach takes the form of review after the research has been completed, with particular focus on the role artificial intelligence algorithms play in augmenting decision-making. The first layer of review could be national, open-science repositories for open-source algorithms and affiliated data or information which are developed during research. The second layer would be a sector-specific validation of the research processes and algorithms by a committee of academics and stakeholders with a wide range of expertise across disciplines. The committee could be created as an off-shoot of an already functioning national oversight body or health technology assessment organization. We use case studies of good practice to explore how this process might operate.",,,,,"; Derrick, Gemma/D-8970-2018","Samuel, Gabby/0000-0001-8111-2730; Derrick, Gemma/0000-0001-5386-8653",,,,,,,,,,,,,0042-9686,1564-0604,,,,APR,2020,98,4,,,,,239,244,,10.2471/BLT.19.237370,http://dx.doi.org/10.2471/BLT.19.237370,,,,,,,,32284646,,,,,WOS:000523183600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, some patients and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the internet for finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own health data and appears to be more innovative. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the second generation of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their self-care and health care. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the self-determination theory-autonomy, relatedness, and competence-at the outset. Results: Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on social media. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their autonomy was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them. Conclusions: Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information.

However, how these ecosystems operate and, in particular their impact on user privacy remains an open question. In this paper, we explore this question by analysing IFTTT, a popular task automation platform based on trigger-action programming. Through IFTTT, end users can easily create applets, aka recipes, that glue different IoT devices and online services together. While IFTTT brings many online services together, such as social media and mobile applications, its use for IoT automation is appealing for many users. Hence, analyzing the IFTTT ecosystem over time, enables us to study IoT trends and adaptation rate in realuser settings. In this paper we describe the IFTTT evolution by analyzing two existing IFTTT data sets and compiling a recent data set of its services and applets. This analysis exposes new platform characteristics and trends. Our data set, which was collected in October 2021, contains data about 694 services, 50 898 applets, and 7 003 endpoints. It also contains data about the information exchange in the platform via ingredients. In addition, we identify applets that might impose privacy risks for their users by detecting sensitive information flows in the system. We find that almost 30% of installations in the platform involve applets that utilize privacy-sensitive information such as users' personal information, location, and health data. This trend is consistently present in the three analyzed data sets and, disturbingly, increases over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2324-898X,,978-1-6654-9425-0,,,,2022,,,,,,,1376,1383,,10.1109/TrustCom56396.2022.00194,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom56396.2022.00194,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000981024300182,View Full Record in Web of Science

The GoM and other regions of the U.S. lack sufficient baseline health information to identify, attribute, mitigate, and facilitate prevention of major health effects of disasters. Developing capacity to assess adverse human health consequences of future disasters requires establishment of a comprehensive, sustained community health observing system, similar to the extensive and well-established environmental observing systems. We propose a system that combines six levels of health data domains, beginning with three existing, national surveys and studies plus three new nested, longitudinal cohort studies. The latter are the unique and most important parts of the system and are focused on the coastal regions of the five GoM States. A statistically representative sample of participants is proposed for the new cohort studies, stratified to ensure proportional inclusion of urban and rural populations and with additional recruitment as necessary to enroll participants from particularly vulnerable or under-represented groups. Secondary data sources such as syndromic surveillance systems, electronic health records, national community surveys, environmental exposure databases, social media, and remote sensing will inform and augment the collection of primary data. Primary data sources will include participant-provided information via questionnaires, clinical measures of mental and physical health, acquisition of biological specimens, and wearable health monitoring devices. A suite of biomarkers may be derived from biological specimens for use in health assessments, including calculation of allostatic load, a measure of cumulative stress. The framework also addresses data management and sharing, participant retention, and system governance. The observing system is designed to continue indefinitely to ensure that essential pre-, during-, and post-disaster health data are collected and maintained. It could also provide a model/vehicle for effective health observation related to infectious disease pandemics such as COVID-19. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive, disaster-focused health observing system such as the one proposed here currently in existence or planned elsewhere. Significant strengths of the GoM Community Health Observing System (CHOS) are its longitudinal cohorts and ability to adapt rapidly as needs arise and new technologies develop.",,,,,"Harville, Emily/AFS-8572-2022; Svendsen, Erik R/J-2671-2015; Engel, Larry/HCH-8527-2022","Harville, Emily/0000-0003-0319-0922; Svendsen, Erik R/0000-0003-3941-0907;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,OCT 15,2020,8,,,,,,,,578463,10.3389/fpubh.2020.578463,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.578463,,,,,,,,33178663,,,,,WOS:000584732800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide 'traditional' types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public.

The urgent need to respond to an emergency leads to resourceful uses of the technologies at hand. However, the best and most cost-effective use of new technologies is to prevent disease and improve resilience. In this paper, the authors present a range of approaches through which both opportunities can be grasped. Global connectedness enables more data to be collected and processed in emergencies, especially with the rise of open-source data, including social media. In general, the poorest and most remote populations are most vulnerable to disaster. However, with smaller, faster, smarter, cheaper and more connected technology, reliable, efficient, and targeted response and recovery can be provided. Initially, crowdsourcing was used to find people, map affected areas, and determine resource allocation. This led to the generation of an overwhelming amount of data, and the need to extract valuable information from that data in a timely manner. As technology evolved, organisations started outsourcing many tasks, first to other people, then to machines. Since the volume of data generated outpaces human capacity, data analysis is being automated using artificial intelligence and machine learning, which furthers our abilities in predictive analytics. As we move towards prevention rather than remediation, information collection and processing must become faster and more efficient while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, these new strategies and technologies can help us to move forwards, by integrating layers of human, veterinary, public, and environmental health data for a One Health approach.",,,,,"Forrest, Russell/JKH-7603-2023","Forrest, Russell/0000-0003-1875-388X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0253-1933,1608-0637,,,,AUG,2020,39,2,,,,,491,501,,10.20506/rst.39.2.3100,http://dx.doi.org/10.20506/rst.39.2.3100,,,,,,,,33046926,,,,,WOS:000604412500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 vaccine cardiovascular complications in Team USA athletes.Hypothesis: It was predicted that there would be a low incidence of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 vaccination in Team USA athletes.Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.Level of Evidence: Level 4.Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee electronic medical record, inclusive of athletes who represented Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games, for COVID-19 vaccine cardiac complications including sudden cardiac arrest/death, myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis. Vaccination status (ie, fully vaccinated, yes or no), date of vaccination and eligible boosters, and type of vaccination during the study period were abstracted from the electronic medical record.Results: A total of 1229 athletes represented Team USA during the 2020 Tokyo (Olympic, 697; Paralympic, 237) and 2022 Beijing Games (Olympic, 229; Paralympic, 66). For the 2020 Tokyo Games, 73.8% of Olympians and 80.6% of Paralympians with available vaccination status had completed a primary vaccine series.

Healthcare professionals and students have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of dental students globally towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students' acceptance levels. Methods: A global cross-sectional study was carried out in February 2021 using an online questionnaire. The study was liaised by the scientific committee of the International Association of Dental Students (IADS), and data were collected through the national and local coordinators of IADS member organizations. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and the independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. Results: A total of 6639 students from 22 countries, representing all world regions, responded to the questionnaire properly. Their mean age was 22.1 +/- 2.8 (17-40) years, and the majority were females (70.5%), in clinical years (66.8%), and from upper-middle-income economies (45.7%). In general, 22.5% of dental students worldwide were hesitant, and 13.9% rejected COVID-19 vaccines. The students in low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) economies had significantly higher levels of vaccine hesitancy compared to their peers in upper-middle- and high-income (UMHI) economies (30.4% vs. 19.8%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: The global acceptance level of dental students for COVID-19 vaccines was suboptimal, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy was influenced by the socioeconomic context where the dental students live and study. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were barriers to vaccination.

Developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine may be possible but there are significant issues with public distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Public health efforts aimed at testing symptomatic patients, and other preventative measures, however, these efforts have been unable to significantly curtail the pandemic. There is a paucity of research that comprehensively focuses on determinants and deterrents to identify critical knowledge gaps. This review aims to focus efforts on strategies to contain the virus. Materials and methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, and archives of preprints were searched with the following terms COVID-19 , SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, epidemiology, determinants, and deterrents. The reference lists of articles were examined for relevant studies. Results: All age groups are susceptible and can transmit the virus. Individuals with severe outcomes include but are not limited to age 65 years or older, male sex, ethnic minorities, and the presence of comorbidities. Misinformation on social media and other traditional information sources is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Indoor and outdoor aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic' transmission, and incubation period of over 14 days in some infected individuals have been reported. Widespread rapid SARS-CoV-2 population screening and contact tracing are methods of effective containment including proper use of facemasks in crowded outdoor or indoor spaces, installation of HEPA filters, regular hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. Simple cost-effective measures include opening doors and windows of buildings where possible. Conclusion: Achieving herd immunity with a vaccine may be difficult because of misinformation. A potential incubation period of over 14 days is the bane of Covid-19 current control strategies. More research is needed including investigating the long-term effects of Covid-19 particularly in children, and fecal aerosol transmission.

Empirical evidence regarding the safety of this training modality is currently limited. Purpose: To examine the incidence of injuries related to CrossFit participation and to estimate the rate of injuries in a large cross-sectional convenience sample of CrossFit participants from around the world. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A total of 3049 participants who reported engaging in CrossFit training between 2013 and 2017 were surveyed. Results: A portion (30.5%) of the participants surveyed reported experiencing an injury over the previous 12 months because of their participation in CrossFit training. Injuries to the shoulders (39%), back (36%), knees (15%), elbows (12%), and wrists (11%) were most common for both male and female participants. The greatest number of injuries occurred among those who participated in CrossFit training 3 to 5 days per week (chi(2) = 12.51; P = .0019). Overall, and based on the assumed maximum number of workout hours per week, the injury rate was 0.27 per 1000 hours (females: 0.28; males: 0.26), whereas the assumed minimum number of workout hours per week resulted in an injury rate of 0.74 per 1000 hours (females: 0.78; males: 0.70). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CrossFit training is relatively safe compared with more traditional training modalities. However, it seems that those within their first year of training as well as those who engage in this training modality less than 3 days per week and/or participate in less than 3 workouts per week are at a greater risk for injuries.",,,,,"Feito, Yuri/HLW-7570-2023; Feito, Yuri/D-8255-2013","Feito, Yuri/0000-0001-6790-6294; Feito, Yuri/0000-0001-6790-6294",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2325-9671,,,,OCT 24,2018,6,10,,,,,,,2.32597E+15,10.1177/2325967118803100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967118803100,,,,,,,,30370310,,,,,WOS:000451445300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most previous research has focused on understanding whether the risk of acute cardiovascular events increases following a respiratory tract infection. The relationship between urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute cardiovascular events is less well studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between UTI and acute myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Methods and analysis We will undertake a self-controlled case series study using linked anonymised general practice, hospital admission and microbiology data held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Self-controlled case series is a relatively novel study design where individuals act as their own controls, thereby inherently controlling for time-invariant confounders. Only individuals who experience an exposure and outcome of interest are included. We will identify individuals in the SAIL Databank who have a hospital admission record for acute MI or stroke during the study period of 2010-2020. Individuals will need to be aged 30-100 during the study period and be Welsh residents for inclusion. UTI will be identified using general practice, microbiology and hospital admissions data. We will calculate the incidence of MI and stroke in predefined risk periods following an UTI and in 'baseline' periods (without UTI exposure) and use conditional Poisson regression models to derive incidence rate ratios. Ethics and dissemination Data access, research permissions and approvals have been obtained from the SAIL independent Information Governance Review Panel, project number 0972. Findings will be disseminated through conferences, blogs, social media threads and peer-reviewed journals. Results will be of interest internationally to primary and secondary care clinicians who manage UTIs and may inform future clinical trials of preventative therapy.",,,,,"Hughes, Kathryn/JFS-2874-2023; Ahmed, Haroon/S-4085-2019; Torabi, Fatemeh/HDO-4423-2022","Ahmed, Haroon/0000-0002-0382-3569; Cannings-John, Rebecca/0000-0001-5235-6517; Reeve, Nicola F/0000-0001-9602-6675; Torabi, Fatemeh/0000-0002-5853-4625; Hughes, Kathryn/0000-0002-8099-066X; Lugg-Widger, Fiona/0000-0003-0029-9703; Akbari, Ashley/0000-0003-0814-0801",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,SEP,2022,12,9,,,,,,,e064586,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064586,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064586,,,,,,,,36137640,,,,,WOS:000859948800033,View Full Record in Web of Science

N.",,,A dynamic data structure for temporal reachability with unsorted contact insertions,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temporal graphs represent interactions between entities over the time. These interactions may be direct (a contact between two nodes at some time instant), or indirect, through sequences of contacts called temporal paths (journeys). Deciding whether an entity can reach another through a journey is useful for various applications in communication networks and epidemiology, among other fields. In this paper, we present a data structure that maintains temporal reachability information under the addition of new contacts. In contrast to previous works, the contacts can be inserted in an arbitrary order-in particular, non-chronologically-which corresponds to systems where the information is collected a posteriori (e.g., when trying to reconstruct contamination chains among people). The main component of our data structure is a generalization of transitive closure called timed transitive closure (TTC), which allows us to maintain reachability information relative to all nested time intervals, without storing all these intervals, nor the journeys themselves. Let n be the number of nodes and tau be the number of timestamps in the lifetime of the temporal graph. Our data structure answers reachability queries regarding the existence of a journey from a given node to another within a given time interval in time O(log tau); it has a worst-case insertion time of O(n(2) log tau); and it can reconstruct a valid journey that witnesses reachability in time O(k log tau), where k < n is the maximum number of contacts of this journey. Finally, the space complexity of our reachability data structure is O(n(2)tau), which remains within the worst-case size of the temporal graph itself.",,,,,"Albertini, Marcelo K/J-7495-2012; Travençolo, Bruno/F-6752-2010","Travençolo, Bruno/0000-0001-7690-301X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1869-5450,1869-5469,,,,DEC,2022,12,1,,,,,,,22,10.1007/s13278-021-00851-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-021-00851-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000734159900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.",,,,,"; MacIntosh, Andrew/B-2242-2013","Castellano-Navarro, Alba/0000-0001-7608-2776; MacIntosh, Andrew/0000-0002-9136-7099",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,NOV 18,2022,10,,,,,,,,e14305,10.7717/peerj.14305,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14305,,,,,,,,36420133,,,,,WOS:000965008100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social media has been investigated in health care research to ascertain positive or negative feelings associated with several conditions but never in sexual medicine. Aim: To assess perceptions related to erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) among Twitter users. Methods: Data collection was performed on a daily basis between May 24-October 9, 2018 (138 days) via an automated script. Data collection was then performed after data cleaning. The statistical software R and the rtweet packages were used in both phases. Results: We collected 11,000 unique tweets for PE and 30,546 unique tweets for ED. After data cleaning, we analyzed 7,020 tweets on PE and 22,648 tweets on ED by analyzing the most recurring words and the clusters describing word associations. The most popular words for ED were Treatment, Health, and Viagra, whereas Sex, Sexual, and Cure were the top 3 for PE. Word clusters suggest the presence of some recurring themes, such as medical terms being grouped together. Additionally, tweets reflect the general feelings triggered by specific events, such as pieces of news pertaining to sexual dysfunctions. Clinical Implications: Tweets on sexual dysfunctions are posted every day, with more tweets on ED than on PE. Treatment is among the chief topics discussed for both conditions, although health concerns differ between PE and DE tweets. Strength and Limitations: This is the first analysis conducted on Tweets in the field of andrology and sexual medicine. A significant number of tweets were collected and analyzed. However, quantitative assessment of the sentiment was not feasible. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunctions are openly discussed on social media, and Twitter analysis could help understand the needs and interests of the general population on these themes.

Methods A prospective study of 7,925 individuals recruited from ongoing cohort studies at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, or through social media campaigns, with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (defined as a self-reported total score of >= 10 in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively) was calculated one month before, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or choosing not to report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated individuals, especially after the second dose.

Topic models originated from Natural Language Processing that is receiving much attention in healthcare areas because of interpretability and its decision making, which motivated us to develop visual topic models. Topic models are used for the extraction of health topics for analyzing discriminative and coherent latent features of tweet documents in healthcare applications. Discovering the number of topics in topic models is an important issue. Sometimes, users enable an incorrect number of topics in traditional topic models, which leads to poor results in health data clustering. In such cases, proper visualizations are essential to extract information for identifying cluster trends. To aid in the visualization of topic clouds and health tendencies in the document collection, we present hybrid topic modeling techniques by integrating traditional topic models with visualization procedures. We believe proposed visual topic models viz., Visual Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual intJNon-negative Matrix Factorization (VintJNMF), and Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) are promising methods for extracting tendency of health topics from various sources in healthcare data clustering. Standard and benchmark social health datasets are used in an experimental study to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed models concerning clustering accuracy (CA), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), precision (P), recall (R), F-Score (F) measures and computational complexities. VNMF visual model performs significantly at an increased rate of 32.4% under cosine based metric in the display of visual clusters and an increased rate of 35-40% in performance measures compared to other visual methods on different number of health topics.",,,,,"K, Rajendra Prasad/P-5662-2016; R M, NOORULLAH/AFM-7572-2022; mohammed, moulana/U-6754-2018; NOORULLAH, R M/AAJ-4868-2021","K, Rajendra Prasad/0000-0002-8366-4149; mohammed, moulana/0000-0001-5039-8836; NOORULLAH, R M/0000-0002-5251-5685",,,,,,,,,,,,,1864-5909,1864-5917,,,,2021 JUN,2021,14,2,,,SI,,545,562,,10.1007/s12065-019-00300-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12065-019-00300-y,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000571455600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In general, health and medical data contain images and medical information about the patients and such personal data should be kept confidential in order to maintain the patients' privacy. Due to limitations in digital data properties, traditional encryption schemes over textual and structural one-dimension data cannot be applied directly to e-health data. In addition, when personal data are sent over the open channels, patients may lose privacy of data contents. Hence, a secure lightweight keyframe extraction method is highly required to ensure timely, correct, and privacy-preserving e-health services. Besides this, it is inherently difficult to achieve a satisfied level of security in a cost-effective way while considering the constraints of real-time e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving chaos-based encryption cryptosystem for patients' privacy protection. The proposed cryptosystem can protect patient's images from a compromised broker. In particular, we propose a fast probabilistic cryptosystem to secure medical keyframes that are extracted from wireless capsule endoscopy procedure using a prioritization method. The encrypted images produced by our cryptosystem exhibits randomness behavior, which guarantee computational efficiency as well as a highest level of security for the keyframes against various attacks. Furthermore, it processes the medical data without leaking any information, thus preserving patient's privacy by allowing only authorized users for decryption. The experimental results and security analysis from different perspectives verify the excellent performance of our encryption cryptosystem compared to other recent encryption schemes.

We created PRIDEnet, a national network of individuals and organizations that actively engaged SGM communities in all stages of health research. The PRIDE Study participants were recruited via in-person outreach, communications to PRIDEnet constituents, social media advertising, and word-of-mouth. Participants completed surveys to report demographic as well as physical, mental, and social health data. Results: We built a secure digital research platform with engaging functionality that engaged SGM people and recruited and retained 13 731 diverse individuals in 2 years.

We applied semi-directed interviews, sociodemographic and health data sheets, and field diaries. We built the sample purposefully. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis and discussed data considering the health psychology framework. Results: We created five categories following a timeline perspective, from before infection to the experience after recovering. Pregnant women were resistant to believing the diagnosis. They described a fear of serious symptoms or death, concerns about the fetus, sorrow from being isolated, and worries about stigma. Family relationships were ambiguous, generating either support or tension. The attachment to the health team through telemedicine or support during hospitalization produced a feeling of security. Conclusions: Participants psychologically denied the COVID-19 diagnosis and did not accomplish isolation properly, even upon medical recommendations. The illness may produce a traumatic experience, regardless of mild or severe symptoms, but family/friend support and contact with the health team helped them to cope. We offer important insights for the clinical approach and future research, emphasizing that infected pregnant women require emotional support. (c) 2021 Australian College of Midwives.

There is variation in treatment of pediatric prehospital patients for both anaphylaxis and seizures. This educational study was done to improve compliance with pediatric prehospital protocols, educate prehospital providers and decrease variation in care. Objective: To improve the quality of care for children with seizures and anaphylaxis in the prehospital setting using a bundled, multifaceted educational intervention. Methods: Evidence-based pediatric prehospital guidelines for seizures and anaphylaxis were used to create a curriculum for the paramedics in the EMS system. The curriculum included in-person training, videos, distribution of decision support tools, and a targeted social media campaign to reinforce the evidence-based guidelines. Prehospital charts were reviewed for pediatric patients with a chief complaint of anaphylaxis or seizures who were transported by paramedics to one of ten hospitals, including three children's hospitals, for 8 months prior to the intervention and eight months following the intervention. The primary outcome for seizures was whether midazolam was given via the preferred intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes. The primary outcome for anaphylaxis was whether IM epinephrine was given. Results: A total of 1,402 pediatric patients were transported for seizures by paramedics to during the study period. A total of 88 patients were actively seizing pre-intervention and 93 post-intervention. Of the actively seizing patients, 52 were given midazolam pre-intervention and 62 were given midazolam post-intervention. Pre-intervention, 29% (15/52) of the seizing patients received midazolam via the preferred IM or IN routes, compared to 74% (46/62) of the seizing patients post-intervention. A total of 45 patients with anaphylaxis were transported by paramedics, 30 pre-intervention and 15 post-intervention. Paramedics administered epinephrine to 17% (5/30) patients pre-intervention and 67% (10/15) patients post-intervention.

Logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association between recruitment type and multiple baseline characteristics. Results: The only differences between recruitment methods were in patient age, with those recruited through the media being significantly older than those recruited through general practice. The mean age difference was 5.0 years (95% confidence interval: 2.2-7.9). Conclusion: Samples recruited through the media and through case identification were largely comparable. Therefore, recruitment through the media may be a viable alternative to recruitment through primary care.

A Cross-Sectional Survey, 2022",CLINICS AND PRACTICE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Vitiligo is a common acquired hypopigmentation skin condition defined by an idiopathic, gradual, and restricted loss of melanin pigment from otherwise healthy-looking skin. The present study aims to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of and attitudes toward vitiligo among the general population of Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional survey targeting adults of the Jazan region was conducted in 2022. The data were collected using an electronic questionnaire distributed through social media in the region. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS computer program. Knowledge and attitude scores were computed. Results: Most of the respondents (83.7%) had an adequate knowledge level of vitiligo, and almost half of the respondents (46.8%) had a positive attitude toward the disease. The majority of the respondents (84.5%) knew that vitiligo is not contagious. However, the majority of the participants (78.6%) did not know that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease. Most of the respondents (93.1%) do not avoid shaking hands with a vitiligo patient to prevent infection, accept food prepared by a vitiligo patient (69.4%), accept sharing a plate with a vitiligo patient (73.6%), and accept to be helped by a vitiligo patient (86.7%). However, about half of the participants (50.4%) refused to marry a person diagnosed with vitiligo. The knowledge of vitiligo in the study population was not correlated with any of the demographic characters, such as age, gender, education, or occupation (p > 0.05). The most important factors associated with good attitudes were male gender (COR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.92-2.84; p = 0.001) and being aged over 50 years (COR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.53-6.13; p = 0.002). Conclusions: The population in Jazan had a good level of knowledge of vitiligo and a positive attitude toward patients with vitiligo. Social media is the source of information for vitiligo for the majority of the study population. The good attitude toward patients with vitiligo was more prevalent in males and older people. More efforts are needed to improve the knowledge of and attitudes toward vitiligo.",,,,,"Mahfouz, Mohamed Salih/A-7388-2012","Mahfouz, Mohamed Salih/0000-0002-3155-6381",,,,,,,,,,,,,2039-7275,2039-7283,,,,DEC,2022,12,6,,,,,876,884,,10.3390/clinpract12060092,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/clinpract12060092,,,,,,,,36412671,,,,,WOS:000900606100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For adult women, the burden of being responsible for the majority of the household labor and the rise in unmarried parenting are likely explanations for why increased paid work opportunities have not resulted in a decrease in the gender gap in depression.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the proportions. Multilinear regression was used to explore how the answers varied by gender, sexuality, and age. Thematic analysis was used to explore the contents of the extended free-text answers. Anxiety was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7).Results: Digital technology use was ubiquitous among young people, with positive and negative aspects acknowledged by both clinicians and young people. Negative experiences were common (131/284, 46.1%) and were associated with increased anxiety levels among young people (GAD-7 3.29; 95% CI 1.97-4.61; P<.001). Although the discussion of digital technology use was regarded as important by clinicians and acceptable by young people, less than half of clinicians (42/85, 49.4%) routinely asked about the use of digital technology and over a third of young people (48/121, 39.6%) who had received mental health care had never been asked about their digital technology use. The conversations were often experienced as unhelpful. Helpful conversations were characterized by greater depth and exploration of how an individual's digital technology use related to mental health. Despite most clinicians (59/83, 71.1%) wanting training, very few (21/86, 24.4%) reported receiving training. Clinicians were open to viewing mental health data from apps or social media to help with consultations. Although young people were generally, in theory, comfortable sharing such data with health professionals, when presented with a binary choice, most reported not wanting to share social media (84/117, 71.8%) or app data (67/118, 56.8%) during consultations.Conclusions: Digital technology use was common, and negative experiences were frequent and associated with anxiety. Over a third of young people were not asked about their digital technology use during mental health consultations, and potentially valuable information about relevant negative experiences on the web was not being captured during consultations. Clinicians would benefit from having access to training to support these discussions with young people. Although young people recognized that app data could be helpful to clinicians, they appeared hesitant to share their own data.

We examined values and opinions about the acceptability of using electronic healthcare predictive analytics (eHPA) to promote HIV prevention in men who have sex with men (MSM). Our aims were twofold: (I) to evaluate the perspectives of MSM with diverse race/ethnicity and age on the acceptability of predictive analytics to determine individual HIV risk and (II) to determine acceptability of having targeted prevention messaging based upon those risk estimates sent directly to the consumer. Method: Two of the authors facilitated 12 focus groups (n=57) with adult MSM without HIV, living in NYC. Groups were divided by ethnicity (Black, Latino, and White) and age (under 35 and 35 and over). Participants were recruited through HIV prevention sites, community-based organizations, social media, and Internet sites that serve these communities. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze the data with Dedoose. Results: We identified six main themes related to acceptability: (I) reach, relevance, and potential uptake of using predictive analytics to establish HIV risk and deliver targeted prevention messaging; (II) patient-provider communication; (III) public health and individual rights; (IV) perceptions of intervention effectiveness; (V) electronic health data security; and (VI) stigma. Within each thematic domain, MSM discussed concerns, benefits, and provided recommendations for implementation. Conclusions: MSM in this study were supportive of the use of ???big data??? and technology to reach marginalized populations and improve public health, yet expressed concerns about the relevance, effectiveness, and security eHPA. Efforts to advance eHPA for HIV prevention should address these concerns, especially among the most-at-risk communities of color.

ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient's health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient.

J,"Comito, C; Falcone, D; Forestiero, A",,,,"Comito, Carmela; Falcone, Deborah; Forestiero, Agostino",,,AI-Driven Clinical Decision Support: Enhancing Disease Diagnosis Exploiting Patients Similarity,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) facilitates the identification of diseases together with the most suitable treatments. In this paper, we propose a CDS framework able to integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches can be employed. A neural network model for predicting patients' future health conditions is proposed. The approach employs word embedding to model the semantic relations of hospital admissions, symptoms and diagnosis, and it introduces a mechanism to measure the relationships of different diagnosis in terms of symptoms similarity to exploit for the prediction task. Several CDSs, including diagnostic decision support systems for inferring patient diagnosis, have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods typically focus on a single patient and apply manually or automatically constructed decision rules to produce a diagnosis. Even worst, they consider only a single medical condition, whereas it is not uncommon that a patient has more than one medical condition at the same time. The novelty of the proposed approach is the combination of supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence methods allowing to combine several and heterogeneous data sources related to a multitude of patients and concerning different medical conditions. Furthermore, with respect to previous approaches, the diagnosis prediction problem is formulated to predict the exact diagnosis in terms of semantic meaning by exploiting Natural Language Processing concepts. Experimental results, performed on a real-world EHR dataset, show that the proposed approach is effective and accurate and provides clinically meaningful interpretations. The obtained outcomes are promising for future extensions of the framework that could be a valuable means for automatic inferring disease diagnosis.",,,,,"Forestiero, Agostino/AAW-9191-2020","comito, carmela/0000-0001-9116-4323",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2022,10,,,,,,6878,6888,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142100,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000745441300001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kenworthy, NJ",,,,"Kenworthy, Nora J.",,,Crowdfunding and global health disparities: an exploratory conceptual and empirical analysis,GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The use of crowdfunding platforms to cover the costs of healthcare is growing rapidly within low-, middle-, and high-income countries as a new funding modality in global health. The popularity of such medical crowdfunding is fueled by health disparities and gaps in health coverage and social safety-net systems. Crowdfunding in its current manifestations can be seen as an antithesis to universal health coverage. But research on medical crowdfunding, particularly in global health contexts, has been sparse, and accessing robust data is difficult. To map and document how medical crowdfunding is shaped by, and shapes, health disparities, this article offers an exploratory conceptual and empirical analysis of medical crowdfunding platforms and practices around the world. Data are drawn from a mixed-methods analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns, as well as an ongoing ethnographic study of crowdfunding platforms and the people who use them. Results: Drawing on empirical data and case examples, this article describes three main ways that crowdfunding is impacting health equity and health politics around the world: 1) as a technological determinant of health, wherein data ownership, algorithms and platform politics influence health inequities; 2) as a commercial determinant of health, wherein corporate influence reshapes healthcare markets and health data; 3) and as a determinant of health politics, affecting how citizens view health rights and the future of health coverage. Conclusions: Rather than viewing crowdfunding as a social media fad or a purely beneficial technology, researchers and publics must recognize it as a complex innovation that is reshaping health systems, influencing health disparities, and shifting political norms, even as it introduces new ways of connecting and caring for those in the midst of health crises. More analysis, and better access to data, is needed to inform policy and address crowdfunding as a source of health disparities.",,,,,,"Kenworthy, Nora/0000-0002-6809-5574",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-8603,,,,NOV 28,2019,15,1,,1,,,,,71,10.1186/s12992-019-0519-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-019-0519-1,,,,,,,,31775896,,,,,WOS:000510460200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One manifestation of this is the suggested correlation of COVID-19 with 5G mobile technology. Throughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data. For each, we consider the unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying meaningful correlation, and how their discarding facilitates conspiracist attribution. In doing so, we offer a basis both to interrogate conspiracists' uses and interpretation of data from elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential for their future misuse in an age of data democratization. Finally, this paper contributes to work on the basis of conspiracy theories in general, by asserting how - absent an appreciation of these key methodological principles - spatial health data may be especially prone to co-option by conspiracist groups.",,,,,,"Flaherty, Eoin/0000-0003-2334-9689; Sturm, Tristan/0000-0001-5757-0117",,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-9536,1873-5347,,,,JAN,2022,293,,,,,,,,114546,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114546,,,,,,,,34954674,,,,,WOS:000791330500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article provides findings from a qualitative interview-based study of young Australians (aged 16-25 years) which explored their practices and understandings related to digital and non-digital sources of health and fitness information, advice and support. The interviews were analysed using a feminist new materialist theoretical framework, paying attention to the affordances, relational connections and affective forces gathering in human-nonhuman assemblages to create a set of key agential capacities. The agential capacities generated by the participants' enactments of digital health included gaining a better knowledge of bodies, illness and healthcare and feeling more in control of health and wellbeing states. While the affordances of convenience, accessibility and detail and diversity of information offered by digital media and devices were valued by the participants, their accounts also highlighted the importance of face-to-face as well as online relationships and personal connections with other people for providing information and support, including family members and friends as well as medical professionals. The participants highly valued the agential capacity of digital technologies to generate detailed information about their bodies and health states and imagined new technologies that would be able to achieve even more detailed personalisation and customisation. However, they expressed little knowledge or concern about how their personal health data may be exploited by other actors or agencies. These insights go some way to recognising and acknowledging the embodied, affective and relational dimensions of living with, through and in the more-than-human worlds of digital health.",,,,,"Lupton, Deborah A/F-5638-2011","Lupton, Deborah A/0000-0003-2658-4430",,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-3322,1470-1243,,,,JAN 2,2020,25,1,,,,,1,13,,10.1080/13573322.2018.1555661,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13573322.2018.1555661,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000587884400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is limited information describing their contribution to this topic. This study describes initiatives and activities related to global health and policy development led by ECPGs.Methods: An online questionnaire was disseminated between July and October 2020 through the International Pharmaceutical Federation Young Pharmacists Group (FIP YPG) mailing list and its social media network. The survey consisted of questions about ECPGs' involvement in global health and policy development activities. In addition to groups or organisations, the FIP YPG also invited individual pharmacists and pharmaceutical sci-entists to explore their needs and views on the role of the ECPGs, and themselves as individuals in global health. Data were analysed descriptively.Results: Thirty national ECPGs across six regions of the World Health Organisation (WHO) participated in the survey. Most of the initiatives led by ECPGs focused on health and wellbeing, quality of education and part-nership. The most common activities were webinars, social events and partnerships with other organisations. In terms of global health challenges listed by the WHO, the most common initiatives led by ECPGs were related to medicines access and medicines safety. There was some involvement of early career pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, and ECPGs in the policy and regulation in their countries across various topics.Conclusion: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first global study exploring initiatives conducted by ECPGs. This study informed initiatives that have been implemented across regions, which could be useful for other ECPGs to initiate in their country according to their needs and priorities.

Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test. Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 +/- 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude. Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed.

During these virus outbreaks, the usage and effectiveness of social media platforms increased significantly, as such platforms served as virtual communities, enabling their users to share and exchange information, news, perspectives, opinions, ideas, and comments related to the outbreaks. Analysis of this Big Data of conversations related to virus outbreaks using concepts of Natural Language Processing such as Topic Modeling has attracted the attention of researchers from different disciplines such as Healthcare, Epidemiology, Data Science, Medicine, and Computer Science. The recent outbreak of the MPox virus has resulted in a tremendous increase in the usage of Twitter. Prior works in this area of research have primarily focused on the sentiment analysis and content analysis of these Tweets, and the few works that have focused on topic modeling have multiple limitations. This paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents the results of performing Topic Modeling on 601,432 Tweets about the 2022 Mpox outbreak that were posted on Twitter between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023. The results indicate that the conversations on Twitter related to Mpox during this time range may be broadly categorized into four distinct themes-Views and Perspectives about Mpox, Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, and Mpox and COVID-19. Second, the paper presents the findings from the analysis of these Tweets. The results show that the theme that was most popular on Twitter (in terms of the number of Tweets posted) during this time range was Views and Perspectives about Mpox. This was followed by the theme of Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, which was followed by the themes of Mpox and COVID-19 and Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, respectively.

Self-reporting of screen use is known to be misreported by pediatric samples and their parents, limiting the accurate determination of the impact of screen use on social, emotional, and cognitive development. Thus, a more passive, objective measurement of smartphone screen use among children is needed. Objective: This study aims to passively sense smartphone screen use by time and types of apps used in a pilot sample of children and to assess the feasibility of passive sensing in a larger longitudinal sample. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study used passive, objective phone app methods for assessing smartphone screen use over 4 weeks in 2019-2020 in a subsample of 67 participants (aged 11-12 years; 31/67, 46% female; 23/67, 34% White). Children and their parents both reported average smartphone screen use before and after the study period, and they completed a questionnaire regarding the acceptability of the study protocol. Descriptive statistics for smartphone screen use, app use, and protocol feasibility and acceptability were reviewed. Analyses of variance were run to assess differences in categorical app use by demographics. Self-report and parent report were correlated with passive sensing data. Results: Self-report of smartphone screen use was partly consistent with objective measurement (r=0.49), although objective data indicated that children used their phones more than they reported. Passive sensing revealed the most common types of apps used were for streaming (mean 1 hour 57 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 32 minutes), communication (mean 48 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 17 minutes), gaming (mean 41 minutes per day, SD 41 minutes), and social media (mean 36 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 7 minutes). Passive sensing of smartphone screen use was generally acceptable to children (43/62, 69%) and parents (53/62, 85%). Conclusions: The results of passive, objective sensing suggest that children use their phones more than they self-report. Therefore, use of more robust methods for objective data collection is necessary and feasible in pediatric samples. These data may then more accurately reflect the impact of smartphone screen use on behavioral and emotional functioning. Accordingly, the ABCD study is implementing a passive sensing protocol in the full ABCD cohort.

We investigated recent temporal trends in anxiety and related mental illness in UK general practice. Aims The aims of this analysis are to examine temporal changes in recording of generalised anxiety in primary care and initial pharmacologic treatments. Method Annual incidence rates of generalised anxiety diagnoses and symptoms were calculated from 795 UK general practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database between 1998 and 2018. Poisson mixed regression was used to account for age, gender and general practitioner practice. Subsequent pharmacologic treatment was examined. Results Generalised anxiety recording rates increased in both genders aged 18-24 between 2014 and 2018. For women, the increase was from 17.06 to 23.33/1000 person years at risk (PYAR); for men, 8.59 to 11.65/1000 PYAR. Increases persisted for a composite of anxiety and depression (49.74 to 57.81/1000 PYAR for women; 25.41 to 31.45/1000 PYAR for men). Smaller increases in anxiety were seen in both genders age 25-34 and 35-44. Anxiety rates among older patients remained stable, although a composite of anxiety and depression decreased for older women. About half of drug-naive patients were prescribed anxiety drugs within 1 year following diagnosis. The most common choice was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Although addressing addiction-the heart of this problem-ought to remain a priority for health practitioners, examining the community-level psychological factors with a known impact on health behaviors may provide valuable insights for attenuating this health crisis by curbing risky behaviors before they evolve into addiction. Objective: The goal of this study is twofold: to demonstrate the relationship between community-level psychological traits and fatal opioid overdose both theoretically and empirically, and to provide a blueprint for using social media data to glean these psychological factors in a real-time, reliable, and scalable manner. Methods: We collected annual panel data from Twitter for 2891 counties in the United States between 2014-2016 and used a novel data mining technique to obtain average county-level Big Five psychological trait scores. We then performed interval regression, using a control function to alleviate omitted variable bias, to empirically test the relationship between county-level psychological traits and the prevalence of fatal opioid overdoses in each county. Results: After controlling for a wide range of community-level biopsychosocial factors related to health outcomes, we found that three of the operationalizations of the five psychological traits examined at the community level in the study were significantly associated with fatal opioid overdoses: extraversion (beta=.308, P<.001), neuroticism (beta=.248, P<.001), and conscientiousness (beta=.229, P<.001). Conclusions: Analyzing the psychological characteristics of a community can be a valuable tool in the local, state, and national fight against the opioid pandemic. Health providers and community health organizations can benefit from this research by evaluating the psychological profile of the communities they serve and assessing the projected risk of fatal opioid overdose based on the relationships our study predict when making decisions for the allocation of overdose-reversal medication and other vital resources.",,,,,,"Tacheva, Zhasmina/0000-0003-3859-5823",,,,,,,,,,,,,2368-7959,,,,,MAR 8,2021,8,3,,,,,,,e24939,10.2196/24939,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24939,,,,,,,,33683210,,,,,WOS:000626428600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term goal is to use risk-based information from empirical socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors. Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2) evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission of S aureus. Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history, etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S aureus transmission. Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on the original funded design for this project (#NIH U54MD012388). That design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337 individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined data monitoring procedures. Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of S aureus carriage and transmission.",,,,,"Pearson, Talima/O-7840-2019; Barger, Steven D./I-3724-2012; Lininger, Monica/N-4833-2015","Pearson, Talima/0000-0003-3696-041X; Wayment, Heidi A./0000-0001-5287-5966; Hepp, Crystal/0000-0002-0612-3648; Kyman, Shari/0000-0001-5386-5866; Villa, Francisco/0000-0002-0522-7576; Hurtado, Kevin/0000-0002-8237-414X; Barger, Steven D./0000-0002-8296-0974; Lininger, Monica/0000-0001-6221-0642",,,,,,,,,,,,,1929-0748,,,,,SEP,2019,8,9,,,,,,,e14853,10.2196/14853,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/14853,,,,,,,,31573953,,,,,WOS:000488621400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Issues within patient-provider relationships, including bias, contribute to health disparities for minority groups. The authors used constructs from self-determination theory (SDT) to explore the nature of health care provider interactions in breast cancer screening and care among Black SMW. Methods Participants were sampled nationally through social media, targeted emails, and referrals. Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 Black cisgender SMW, ages 38 to 64 years, who had a breast cancer diagnosis or recent abnormal mammogram. Interviews were conducted face-to-face or online, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Two analysts coded the interviews. Codes were analyzed across interviews to identify themes salient to SDT. Results Themes aligned with the SDT constructs of relatedness and autonomy. Some participants discussed feeling most understood by Black and/or female providers who shared at least 1 of their identities. Feeling understood through shared identity contributed to participants feeling seen and heard by their providers. Participants who discussed negative experiences with providers believed that the provider made negative assumptions about them based on their race and/or sexual orientation. Conclusions When interacting with health care providers for breast cancer screening and care, Black SMW face specific challenges related to their multiply marginalized social position. Reducing health care provider bias toward Black SMW may improve patients' desires to continue in care.

Major depression is associated with significant disability, morbidity, and mortality. The current study estimated trends in the prevalence of major depression in the US population from 2005 to 2015 overall and by demographic subgroups. Methods. Data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of US persons ages 12 and over (total analytic sample N = 607 520). Past-year depression prevalence was examined annually among respondents from 2005 to 2015. Time trends in depression prevalence stratified by survey year were tested using logistic regression. Data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and education. Results. Depression prevalence increased significantly in the USA from 2005 to 2015, before and after controlling for demographics. Increases in depression were significant for the youngest and oldest age groups, men, and women, Non-Hispanic White persons, the lowest income group, and the highest education and income groups. A significant year x demographic interaction was found for age. The rate of increase in depression was significantly more rapid among youth relative to all older age groups. Conclusions. The prevalence of depression increased significantly in the USA from 2005 to 2015. The rate of increase in depression among youth was significantly more rapid relative to older groups.

Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of Hong Kong residents aged 15 years or older during the first three weeks of July, 2019. Respondents reported current depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, participation in protest activities, attitudes and perceived stress, disruptions to daily routines, and demographics. Results: Among 1112 respondents, 25.7% reported probable depression, and 9.1% reported suicidal ideation. Multivariable logistic regression showed that persons with higher odds of probable depression had primary education and high disruptions to regular routines of eating, sleep, socializing, and leisure activities. Persons who were at higher odds of suicidal ideation had lower household income, used social media to engage in the protests, and had medium or high disruptions to regular eating and sleep. Conclusions: During the anti-extradition bill protests, the prevalence of probable depression and suicidal ideation were substantially higher than would be expected and higher than during the Umbrella Movement of 2014.

Participants were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test, along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information. Results: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access to COVID-19 testing.

BVS has been translated into Spanish and validated through confirmatory factor analysis. Participants have been also scored with the self-report panic disorder severity scale (PDSS-SR). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test was adequate (KMO=0.0887) and sphericity tested significantly (p<0.001). The confirmatory analysis confirmed that the scale is one-dimensional. Results: The model adjustment was good, according to all fit indices. Cronbach's alpha also confirmed an excellent internal consistency (alpha=0.985). Scores between the two scales (BVS and PDSS-SR) have shown a good convergence (r=0.898; p<0.001). Conclusion: The Spanish version of the BVS has shown good psychometric properties and adequately reproduce the one-dimensional model of the original English version.",,,,,"Torales, Julio/D-1254-2017; Barrios, Iván/ABI-5877-2020; Castaldelli-Maia, João M/I-6309-2013; Ventriglio, Antonio/IAQ-5125-2023","Torales, Julio/0000-0003-3277-7036; Barrios, Iván/0000-0002-6843-7685; Castaldelli-Maia, João M/0000-0001-9621-2291; Amarilla Salvioni, Juan Diego/0000-0002-3554-5591; Melgarejo, Osvaldo/0000-0002-3410-775X; Ventriglio, Antonio/0000-0002-3934-7007; Ruiz Diaz, Noelia/0000-0002-5321-9589; O'Higgins, Marcelo/0000-0002-8257-0183; Figueredo, Pamela/0000-0003-1364-7471",,,,,,,,,,,,,2516-3507,,,,,AUG,2022,19,4,,,,,,,em386,10.29333/ejgm/12141,http://dx.doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/12141,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000812358600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An analysis of online patient searches for rotator cuff repair,JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery often search the internet for information regarding the procedure. One popular source, Google, compiles frequently asked questions and links to websites that may provide answers. This study provides an analysis of the most frequently searched questions associated with rotator cuff surgery. We hypothesize that there will be distinct search patterns associated with online queries about rotator cuff surgery that could provide unique insights into patient concerns. Methods: A set of search terms were entered into Google Web Search using a clean-install Google Chrome browser. Frequently associated questions and their webpages were extracted to a database via a data mining extension. Questions were categorized by topics relevant for rotator cuff arthroscopy. Websites were categorized by source and scored for quality using the JAMA Benchmark Criteria. Pearson's x(2) tests were used to analyze nominal data. Student t tests were performed to compare JAMA Benchmark Scores.Results: Of the 595 questions generated from the initial search, 372 unique questions associated with 293 websites were extracted and categorized. The most popular question topics were activities/restrictions (20.7%), pain (18.8%), and indications/management (13.2%). The 2 most common websites searched were academic (35.2%) and medical practice (27.4%). Commercial websites were significantly more likely to be associated with questions about cost (57.1% of all cost questions, P = .01), anatomy/function (62.5%, P = .001), and evaluation of surgery (47.6%, P < .001). Academic websites were more likely to be associated with questions about technical details of surgery (58.1%, P < .001). Medical practice and social media websites were more likely associated with activities/restrictions (48.1%, P < .001, and 15.6%, P < .001, respectively). Government websites were more likely associated with timeline of recovery (12.8%, P = .01). On a scale of 0-4, commercial and academic websites had the highest JAMA scores (3.06 and 2.39, respectively). Conclusion: Patients seeking information regarding rotator cuff repair primarily use the Google search engine to ask questions regarding postoperative activity and restrictions, followed by pain, indications, and management. Academic websites, which were associated with technical details of surgery, and medical practice websites, which were associated with activities/restrictions, were the 2 most commonly searched resources.

The combined abuse of alcohol and the highly addictive methamphetamine has worsened the drug epidemic in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape province. In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated to model the dynamics of alcohol and methamphetamine co-abuse. We prove that the equilibria of the submodels are locally and globally asymptotically stable when the sub-model threshold parameters are less than unity. The basic reproduction number due to co-abuse is shown to be the maximum of the two sub-model reproduction numbers. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the most sensitive parameters in the co-abuse epidemic are the alcohol and methamphetamine recruitment rates B-1 and B-2 respectively. The prevalence curve is indicative of a persistent drug problem in the region. Hence, the need to promote social programs that raise awareness of the dangers posed by multiple substance abuse, through educational campaigns in learning institutions, social media and health institutions.

Results: Chronic pain and HICP prevalences in the Saudi adult population were found to be 46.4% (CP) and 4% (HICP), with a higher prevalence among women and elderly. Chronic back pain was the most reported pain location. Half of the respondents reported dissatisfaction with pain services. Greater prevalence of HICP was found among women, elderly, unemployed, and those with low-income status. Patients with HICP were more likely to have more healthcare utilization and have more negative impacts on their physical and psychological wellbeing.

Data on hesitancy amongst child and adolescent populations is largely confined to parent opinion. We investigated the characteristics of vaccine hesitant children and adolescents using results from a large, school-based selfreport survey of the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccination in students aged 9 -18 years in England. Methods: Data from the OxWell Student Survey on mental health, life experiences and behaviours were used, collected from four counties across England. Local authority partners recruited schools. The vaccine hesitancy question gave six response options and were clustered to inform delivery: eager and willing were categorised as vaccination 'opt-in', don't know and not bothered categorised as 'undecided', and unwilling and antivaccination categorised as 'opt-out'. We conducted a multinomial regression to determine associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic, health behaviour and social connection variables. Findings: 27,910 students from 180 schools answered the vaccine hesitancy question between 14th May and 21st July 2021, of whom 13984 (50.1%) would opt-in to take a vaccination, 10322 (37.0%) were undecided, and 3604 (12.9%) would opt-out. A lower percentage of younger students reported that they would opt-in to vaccination, for example, 35.7% of 9-year-olds and 51.3% of 13-year-olds compared to 77.8% of 17-year-olds would opt-in to take a vaccination. Students who were 'opt-out' or 'undecided' (a combined 'vaccine hesitant' group) were more likely to come from deprived socioeconomic contexts with higher rates of home rental versus home ownership and their school locations were more likely to be in areas of greater deprivation. They were more likely to smoke or vape, spend longer on social media, feel that they did not belong in their school community but had lower levels of anxiety and depression. The vaccine hesitant students- the undecided and opt-out groups- were similar in profile, although the opt-out students had higher reported confirmed or probable previous COVID-19 infection than the opt-in group, whereas those undecided, did not. Interpretation: If government vaccination strategies move towards vaccinating younger school-aged students, efforts to increase vaccination uptake may be necessary. Compared with students who would opt-in, those who were vaccine hesitant had greater indicators of social deprivation and felt a lack of community cohesion by not feeling a sense of belonging at their school. There were indications that those students who would opt-out had higher levels of marginalisation and mistrust. If programmes are rolled out, focus on hesitant younger students will be important, targeting more marginalised and deprived young people with information from trusted sources utilising social media; improving access to vaccination centres with provision both in and outside school; and addressing fears and worries about the effects of the vaccine. The main limitation of this study is that the participant group may not be wholly representative of England or the UK, which may bias population-level estimates of willingness to be vaccinated.

Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geo-social interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source.

This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings. Findings Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75-81%]) and education workers (64% [59%-69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%-40%] and 38% [33%-43%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51% [44%-57%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent restrictions. Interpretation Major variations in workplace contact patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk. Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community transmission and emergence of variants.

This paper describes the methods used to maintain a large national guideline for stroke management. Study design and setting: The Australian Stroke Clinical Guidelines are developed to meet Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) standards. Monthly surveillance is conducted for new systematic reviews and randomised controlled studies. Included studies undergo data extraction followed by preparation of updated evidence-to-decision frameworks which are used to inform updates, or development of new recommendations. Small writing groups made up of clinical experts and those with lived experience review and agree on changes, which are finally reviewed by a multidisciplinary Guidelines Steering Group. Draft changes are developed and published using the online MAGICapp platform, with dissemination and promotion via traditional methods as well as social media. Results: Each month approximately 350 abstracts are considered, covering 96 clinical topics and taking on average 16 h to review. There have been four major guideline updates covering 34 new and updated recommendations.

These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.",,,,,,"Mwiine, Frank/0000-0002-8434-4710; Muhanguzi, Dennis/0000-0001-5458-8530",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,OCT 30,2023,13,1,,,,,,,18619,10.1038/s41598-023-44518-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-44518-4,,,,,,,,37903814,,,,,WOS:001094965500033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the several determinants of this late diagnosis, the most important is the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the oral cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore the care-seeking behaviour and its determinants among oral cancer patients. Methods: A face-to-face in-depth interview was conducted among 70 oral cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire, and qualitative content analysis of the results was performed. Results: All the patients had squamous-cell carcinoma and none had attended any screening programme. The most common site affected was the buccal mucosa with a non-healing wound. Most of the patients contacted a doctor available nearby; only 7% of patients consulted a dentist. Only one patient approached a traditional healer. The median patient delay was 30 (4-365) days and the professional delay was 40 (4-650) days. Enablers included determinants such as increasing symptoms (80%), influence of the society (74%), fear (10%), and social media (3%). The main barriers were lack of awareness (97%), hope that the lesion will heal spontaneously (90%), lack of perception of seriousness (64%), financial constraints (55%), provider switching (47%), and missed diagnosis (44%).

This study employed the trust in institutions and trust in media as a theoretical framework and seeks to analyze how these two affect South Korean sojourners' intention to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. 25 South Korean sojourners living in Beijing participated in semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the mistrust South Korean sojourners have in China's institutions and media, both traditional and social media, led to their reluctance to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines.

Camouflaging (behaving differently to fit in) may be a mechanism by which autistic traits and mental health difficulties relate to each other, but little research has considered the role of different facets of camouflaging. Additionally, autistic identity might buffer against camouflaging and mental health difficulties. This research aims to explore the mediating effects of camouflaging behaviours on the relationship between autistic traits and both positive and negative mental wellbeing, as well as how autistic identity might moderate the relationship between autistic traits and camouflaging, and also mental health. Data were available for 627 autistic adults, recruited through volunteer databases and social media. Participants completed measures of autistic traits, anxiety, depression, positive wellbeing, camouflaging behaviours (compensating for difficulties, masking, and assimilating/putting on an act) and autistic identity. Mediation and moderated mediation models were tested, applying 95% bootstrapped CIs (10,000 resamples) and including age, gender and diagnosis as covariates. There were no significant direct effects between autistic traits and mental wellbeing. Assimilation was a significant mediator of all mental wellbeing measures, and compensation was a significant mediator of positive wellbeing only. Autistic identity was not a significant moderator. Assimilation and compensation should be considered when offering psychological interventions to support mental wellbeing of autistic people. Additional research into external drivers of camouflaging (e.g. stigma) and mechanisms by which camouflaging impacts mental wellbeing, such as autonomy, authenticity, skill mastery and community, may identify other areas of support. Concurrently, societal change is necessary to reduce the need to camouflage. Putting on an act to fit in is linked to worse depression, anxiety, suicidality, and positive wellbeing. Compensating for difficulties is linked to better positive wellbeing. A positive autistic identity did not change this. We should explore why changing how you act and compensating have this effect, so we can give better support and improve wellbeing for autistic people. We should also reduce stigma from society, so autistic people do not need to change their behaviour to try to fit in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1939-3792,1939-3806,,,,2023 DEC 18,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/aur.3073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aur.3073,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38108621,,,,,WOS:001129272400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Registries are an essential, reliable tool for assessing epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approach in a single hub, especially when data are dispersive and inconclusive, as in our case. The dissemination of this preliminary survey would allow us to understand if the creation of an International Registry is a viable option, while still offering a snapshot on this issue, investigating clinical practices worldwide. The steering committee designed an online questionnaire with Google Forms, which consisted of 37 questions, and was open from October 5th, 2022, to November 30th, 2022. It was disseminated using social media and mailing lists of the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE), the Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe (ACIE), and the Spanish Chapter of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Overall, 141 surgeons (approximately 18% of the total invitations sent) from 27 countries on four continents participated in the survey. Most respondents worked in general surgery units (62%), performing less than 50 liver resections/year (57%). A multidisciplinary discussion was currently performed to validate surgical indications for NCNNLM in 96% of respondents. The most commonly adopted selection criteria were liver resectability, RECIST criteria, and absence of extrahepatic disease. Primary tumors were generally of gastrointestinal (42%), breast (31%), and pancreaticobiliary origin (13%). The most common interventions were parenchymal-sparing resections (51% of respondents) of metachronous metastases with an open approach. Major post-operative complications (Clavien-Dindo > 2) occurred in up to 20% of the procedures, according to 44% of respondents. A subset analysis of data from high-volume centers (> 100 cases/year) showed lower post-operative complications and better survival. The present survey shows that NCNNLM patients are frequently treated by surgeons in low-volume hospitals for liver surgery. Selection criteria are usually based on common sense. Liver resections are performed mainly with an open approach, possibly carrying a high burden of major post-operative complications. International guidelines and a specific consensus on this field are desirable, as well as strategies for collaboration between high-volume and low-volume centers. The present study can guide the elaboration of a multi-institutional document on the optimal pathway in the management of patients with NCNNLM.",,,,,"Palomba, Giuseppe/HKO-9031-2023; Clementi, Marco/P-8582-2016; Muttillo, Edoardo Maria/ABC-2794-2021; Spartalis, Eleftherios/W-8936-2018; Merlini, David A/O-2858-2014; Pérez-Bertólez, Sonia/AEY-8589-2022; Currò, Giuseppe/H-5533-2012; Perra, Teresa/AAW-8098-2020; Machain Vega, Gustavo Miguel/JLL-0357-2023; Serradilla-Martín, Mario/ABD-6520-2021; Gica, Nicolae/W-1142-2018; Papa, Mario Virgilio/ABF-2638-2020; Calini, Giacomo/KBA-4166-2024; Panyko, Arpád/AAQ-6309-2020; D'Acapito, Fabrizio/J-9157-2019; Saeidi shahri, Sara/AEY-9580-2022; Rodriguez-Lopez, Mario/Q-9044-2016; Campanile, Fabio Cesare/G-2831-2012; Sanberg, Jonas/S-7139-2018","Palomba, Giuseppe/0000-0003-3954-5166; Clementi, Marco/0000-0002-9652-5148; Muttillo, Edoardo Maria/0000-0003-3562-0392; Spartalis, Eleftherios/0000-0003-4451-8074; Merlini, David A/0000-0002-7981-7149; Pérez-Bertólez, Sonia/0000-0002-3312-0952; Currò, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9566-1378; Perra, Teresa/0000-0001-7032-1289; Machain Vega, Gustavo Miguel/0000-0001-9848-1575; Gica, Nicolae/0000-0002-8425-6307; Papa, Mario Virgilio/0000-0002-1579-2202; Calini, Giacomo/0000-0002-7460-9578; Panyko, Arpád/0000-0002-1895-1790; D'Acapito, Fabrizio/0000-0001-6420-6209; Saeidi shahri, Sara/0000-0001-9255-821X; Capuano, Marianna/0000-0002-7623-7747; Porcu, Alberto/0000-0001-6307-8938; Arroyo Murillo, Gabriela Aracelly/0000-0002-3807-908X; Younis, Muhammad Umar/0000-0001-6366-6991; Rodriguez-Lopez, Mario/0000-0002-8451-4126; Poillucci, Gaetano/0000-0002-3961-1904; Campanile, Fabio Cesare/0000-0003-3830-634X; Neelamraju Lakshmi, Harish/0000-0001-9558-1335; Sanberg, Jonas/0000-0002-9943-3521",,,,,,,,,,,,,2038-131X,2038-3312,,,,2023 OCT 24,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s13304-023-01649-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13304-023-01649-7,,OCT 2023,,,,,,37875725,,,,,WOS:001096295300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The statistically significant variables were determined as age, status of using face shield, status of wearing overalls and status of wearing shoe covers (p<0.05). We determined that facial pressure injuries were not significantly associated with getting COVID-19 infection (p>0,05).Conclusions: This study showed that facial pressure injuries associated with personal protective equipment use among nurses, who work on the frontlines in the COVID-19 pandemic period, is highly prevalent. Experiencing facial pressure injuries did not have a significant effect on the participants' statuses of getting infected with COVID-19. Providing training in health institutions may present an effective strategy in lowering problems.",,,,,"Altun, Emrah/JEP-7755-2023","Ucar, Ozge/0000-0002-5710-5394",,,,,,,,,,,,,0965-206X,1876-4746,,,,NOV,2022,31,4,,,,,699,706,,10.1016/j.jtv.2022.09.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2022.09.008,,DEC 2022,,,,,,36195528,,,,,WOS:000906352300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods and analysis Children are recruited prior to URTI or within 48 hours of developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local schools/nurseries, health centres/hospitals, recreational facilities, public events, workplaces, local/social media. Willing parents/guardians, of children <7 years of age will be asked to contact the research team at their local site. Children will be randomised to either a control arm (standard symptomatic care), or intervention arm (three drops/nostril of HS, at least four times a day, until 24 hours after asymptomatic or a maximum of 28 days). All participants are requested to provide a nasal swab at the start of the study (intervention arm: before HS drops) and then daily for four more days. Parent/guardian complete a validated daily diary, an end of illness diary, a satisfaction questionnaire and a wheeze questionnaire (day 28). The parent/guardian of a child in the intervention arm is taught to prepare HS nose drops. Parent/guardian of children asymptomatic at recruitment are requested to inform the research team within 48 hours of their child developing an URTI and follow the instructions already provided. The day 28 questionnaire determines if the child experienced a wheeze following illness. Participation in the study ends on day 28. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (18/WS/0080). It is cosponsored by Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development-a partnership between the University of Edinburgh and National Health Service Lothian Health Board.

Methods: Routine surveillance confirmed locally acquired cases in the second week of December, leading to a rapid public health response including case management guidance and epidemiological investigations. The main activity was the vector survey using systematic sampling to assess extent of previously unreported Aedes aegypti presence followed by a campaign aimed to eliminate breeding sites of A. aegypti. Results: During a 5-month period, 343 suspected cases were reported from Muscat Governorate with 122 from the outbreak affected area. Out of 207 probable cases eligible for laboratory testing as per guidelines issued, 59 cases were confirmed. The vector elimination campaign started on January 8, 2019 after a media advocacy using television and social media and concluded on January 23. By the end of campaign, the case load had decreased significantly in the affected area with no reports of locally acquired cases from adjoining areas of Muscat Governorate, indicating no further spread. Conclusions: Rapid notification and early community-wide, extensive vector control activities effectively contained the autochthonous dengue fever virus outbreak. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Most of the users of NSAIDs aren't aware of the serious side effects of these medications. Aim: Estimation of parental awareness about NSIADs use and their side effects among their children in Qassim region. Materials and methods: The participants involved in the study are the parents whom have child/children aged 14 years old or younger. The population sample was selected randomly and they participated in the study with their own volition. The questionnaires were distributed through social media. Data analyses were done by using SPSS version 26. This study is cross-sectional study with a sample size of 516 conducted in Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Results: 516 were recruited (153 males and 363 females).

This article describes the methods used to develop and maintain the guidelines. Methods: The guidelines use the GRADE methods and are designed to meet Australian NHMRC standards. Each week, new evidence is reviewed, current recommendations are revised, and new recommendations made. These are published in MAGIC and disseminated through traditional and social media. Relevant new questions to be addressed are continually sought from stakeholders and practitioners. For prioritized questions, the evidence is actively monitored and updated. Evidence surveillance combines horizon scans and targeted searches. An evidence team appraises and synthesizes evidence and prepares evidence-to-decision frameworks to inform development of recommendations. A guidelines leadership group oversees the development of recommendations by multidisciplinary guidelines panels and is advised by a consumer panel. Results: : The Taskforce formed in March 2020, and the first recommendations were published 2 weeks later. The guidelines have been revised and republished on a weekly basis for 24 weeks, and as of October 2020, contain over 90 treatment recommendations, suggesting that living methods are feasible in this context. Conclusions: The Australian guidelines for care of people with COVID-19 provide an example of the feasibility of living guidelines and an opportunity to test and improve living evidence methods.

CDC, state, and local health partners interviewed patients with a questionnaire that focused on hedgehog exposures, conducted traceback of patients' hedgehog purchases, and collected hedgehog faecal pellets and environmental samples. Isolates in this outbreak were analysed using core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) and compared to sequence data from historic clinical isolates from a 2011-2013 outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses linked to pet hedgehogs. Fifty-four illnesses in 23 states were identified between October 2018 and September 2019. Patients ranged from <1 to 95 years, and 65% were female. Eight patients were hospitalized. Eighty-one per cent (29/36) of patients interviewed reported contact with a hedgehog before becoming ill; of these, 21 (72%) reported owning a hedgehog. Analysis of 53 clinical, 11 hedgehog, and two hedgehog bedding isolates from this outbreak, seven hedgehog isolates obtained prior to this outbreak, and two clinical isolates from the 2011-2013 outbreak fell into three distinct groupings (37 isolates in Clade 1 [0-10 alleles], 28 isolates in Clade 2 [0-7 alleles], and eight isolates in Clade 3 [0-12 alleles]) and were collectively related within 0-31 alleles by cgMLST. Purchase information available from 20 patients showed hedgehogs were purchased from multiple breeders across nine states, a pet store, and through an online social media website; a single source of hedgehogs was not identified. This outbreak highlights the ability of genetic sequencing analysis to link historic and ongoing Salmonella illness outbreaks and demonstrates the strain of Salmonella linked to hedgehogs might continue to be a health risk to hedgehog owners unless measures are taken to prevent transmission.",,,,,"Stapleton, Gregory/JYQ-6073-2024","Stapleton, Gregory/0000-0002-1784-6577; Hoff, Connor/0000-0003-4353-1533; Francois Watkins, Louise/0000-0002-1165-1162; Morningstar-Shaw, Brenda R/0009-0000-8316-5748",,,,,,,,,,,,,1863-1959,1863-2378,,,,2022 MAY,2022,69,3,,,,,167,174,,10.1111/zph.12904,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.12904,,JAN 2022,,,,,,35048538,,,,,WOS:000745683200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Early diagnosis and treatment of a severe allergic reaction requires recognition of the signs and symptoms, as well as classification of severity. It is a clinical emergency, and healthcare providers should have the knowledge for recognition and management. The aim of the study is to evaluate the level of knowledge in the management of anaphylaxis in healthcare providers. Methods: It is an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare providers over 18 years old via a Google Forms link and shared through different social media platforms. A 12-item questionnaire was applied which included the evaluation of the management of anaphylaxis, from June 2020 to May 2021. Results: A total of 1023 surveys were evaluated; 1013 met inclusion criteria and were included in the statistical analysis. A passing grade was considered with 8 or more correct answers out of 12; the overall approval percentage was 28.7%. The group with the highest percentage of approval in the questionnaire was health-care providers with more than 30 years of work experience. There was a significant difference between the proportions of approval between all specialty groups, and in a post-hoc analysis, allergy and immunology specialists showed greater proportions of approval compared to general medicine practitioners (62.9% vs 25%; p=<0.001).

With a re-emergence in Venezuela during the past two decades, the spread of CD has proved susceptible to, and inhibitable by a digital, real-time sur-veillance system effectuated by Citizen Scientists in communities throughout the country. The #TraeTuChipo (#BringYourKissingBug) campaign implemented in January 2020, has served as such a strategy counting on community engagement to define the current ecological distribution of CD vectors despite the absence of a functional national surveillance program. This pilot campaign collected data through online surveys, social media platforms, and/or telephone text messages. A total of 79 triatomine bugs were reported from eighteen Venezuelan states; 67 bugs were identified as Panstrongylus geniculatus, 1 as Rhodnius pictipes, 1 as Triatoma dimidiata, and 10 as Triatoma maculata. We analyzed 8 triatomine feces samples spotted from 4 Panstrongylus geniculatus which were confirmed positive by qPCR for T. cruzi. Further molecular characteriza-tion of discrete typing units (DTUs), revealed that all samples contained TcI, the most highly diverse and broadly distributed strain of T. cruzi. Moreover, analysis of the mitochondrial 12S gene revealed Myotis keaysi, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus as the main triatomine feeding sources.

This review discusses some of the evidence that triangulates on this issue, including data from hate crime statistics, social media analysis, and survey-based research. It also examines the data needs for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities. Recent Findings The available data provides evidence that the pandemic has contributed to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment and discriminatory incidents. Many reports have surfaced showing a surge in anti-Chinese discrimination, which has spilled over into other Asian communities. Research is beginning to emerge to show that such discrimination may also impact health issues such as psychological distress. Given prior research, we would expect many more studies to emerge in the future. Also, the pandemic has illustrated the major gaps in data available to disentangle the health and social concerns facing Asian Americans and NHPI communities. Significant issues include the lack of systematic reporting of data for these communities both across states, and even among agencies within a state; erroneous aggregation of Asians with NHPIs; and censoring of data. These gaps and issues contribute to bias that obscures objective data and amplifies health inequalities.

J,"Klein, TM; Augustin, M; Otten, M",,,,"Klein, Toni Maria; Augustin, Matthias; Otten, Marina",,,How should electronic health records be designed? A cross-sectional study in patients with psoriasis,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Electronic health records (EHRs) are promising tools for routine care. These applications might not only enhance the interaction between patient and physician but also support therapy management. This is crucial in complex and chronic conditions like psoriasis. However, EHRs can only unfold their full potential when being accepted by the users. Therefore, this study aims to analyse how EHRs should be designed for patients with psoriasis and to identify differences between patient subgroups. Methods We developed a questionnaire on the acceptability of EHRs based on literature research and results from focus groups. Participants completed a paper-based or electronic version of the questionnaire. We recruited participants at an outpatient clinic as well as online via patient associations and a social media platform. We analysed data using descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses applying Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Results The sample encompassed 187 patients with psoriasis. Data reveals that 84.4% of the participants can think of entering data into an EHR. Participants prefer entering data at home (72.2%) instead of entering data in the waiting room (44.9%) and using an own internet-ready device (laptop/computer: 62.6%; smartphone/tablet: 61.5%) instead of a provided device (46.0%). Altogether, 55.6% of participants would accept entering data on a monthly basis when this lasts between one and 10 minutes and further 27.8% would accept even longer lasting data entry. Data privacy is of great concern (e.g. patient should decide who has access to data: 96.7%). Subgroup analyses reveal differences with regard to age, educational level, burden due to psoriasis, number of internet activities, use of electronic questionnaires and mode of administration. Conclusion The high acceptance of entering data is favourable for the implementation of EHRs. The results suggest technical and structural recommendations: Differences between subgroups support the development of flexible EHRs encompassing a basic module, which is expandable with further add-ons, and compatible to different devices. Furthermore, involving patients by entering data into an EHR requires that physicians communicate open-mindedly with the patient and consider data throughout decision-making. Patients should remain owner of their own health data and decide about its processing.",,,,,"Janke, Toni/AAJ-4539-2021","Janke, Toni Maria/0000-0002-9861-9519",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6947,,,,NOV 12,2019,19,1,,,,,,,218,10.1186/s12911-019-0926-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-019-0926-5,,,,,,,,31718653,,,,,WOS:000497672400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods:A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results:298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91-0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85-0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35-0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92-0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions:The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system.",,,,,"Schadendorf, Dirk/AAE-8206-2019","Schadendorf, Dirk/0000-0003-3524-7858; Brinker, Titus Josef/0000-0002-3620-5919",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-858X,,,,JUN 2,2020,7,,,,,,,,233,10.3389/fmed.2020.00233,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00233,,,,,,,,32671078,,,,,WOS:000543075400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

(3) Results: A total of 12,171 research articles were published in 2036 journals classified under a variety of subject areas, with pediatrics (27.7%), nutrition and dietetics (18.5%), and public environmental and occupational health (18.4%) accounting for the most frequent study areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity (299), and BMC Public Health being the most productive journals. The main challenges identified for pediatric obesity include general topics such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4) Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number of published articles of 59.8%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics along with specialized health terms and terms related to public health.",,,,,/ACP-0932-2022,"Castello-Cogollos, Lourdes/0000-0002-0305-3154",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,FEB,2022,19,3,,,,,,,1251,10.3390/ijerph19031251,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031251,,,,,,,,35162274,,,,,WOS:000920550000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: The site, AIDSVu.org, aims to make data about the US HIV epidemic widely available, easily accessible, and locally relevant to inform public health decision making. Methods: AIDSVu develops visualizations, maps, and downloadable datasets using results from HIV surveillance systems, other population-based sources of information (eg, US Census and national probability surveys), and other data developed specifically for display and dissemination through the website (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] prescriptions). Other types of content are developed to translate surveillance data into summarized content for diverse audiences using infographic panels, interactive maps, local and state fact sheets, and narrative blog posts. Results: Over 10 years, AIDSVu.org has used an expanded number of data sources and has progressively provided HIV surveillance and related data at finer geographic levels, with current data resources providing HIV prevalence data down to the census tract level in many of the largest US cities. Data are available at the county level in 48 US states and at the ZIP Code level in more than 50 US cities. In 2019, over 500,000 unique users consumed AIDSVu data and resources, and HIV-related data and insights were disseminated through nearly 4,000,000 social media posts. Since AIDSVu's inception, at least 249 peer-reviewed publications have used AIDSVu data for analyses or referenced AIDSVu resources. Data uses have included targeting of HIV testing programs, identifying areas with inequitable PrEP uptake, including maps and data in academic and community grant applications, and strategically selecting locations for new HIV treatment and care facilities to serve high-need areas. Conclusions: Surveillance data should be actively used to guide and evaluate public health programs; AIDSVu translates high-quality, population-based data about the US HIV epidemic and makes that information available in formats that are not consistently available in surveillance reports. Bringing public health surveillance data to an online resource is a democratization of data, and presenting information about the HIV epidemic in more visual formats allows diverse stakeholders to engage with, understand, and use these important public health data to inform public health decision making.",,,,,"Sullivan, Patrick Sean/AAX-4604-2021","Sullivan, Patrick Sean/0000-0002-7728-0587; Mokotoff, Eve/0000-0002-9588-0471; Woodyatt, Cory/0000-0002-1630-862X; Taussig, Jennifer/0000-0003-4863-2640; Benbow, Nanette/0000-0001-6715-1530; Siegler, Aaron/0000-0001-5553-7540; Luisi, Nicole/0000-0003-4466-7141; Bradley, Heather/0000-0002-7667-4197",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,OCT 23,2020,22,10,,,,,,,e23173,10.2196/23173,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23173,,,,,,,,33095177,,,,,WOS:000600317100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bullying and sexual abuse are potentially potent shared risk factors for the spectrum of eating and weight disorders. Methods: A representative sample of N = 3005 South Australian males and females >= 15 years was interviewed about their height, weight, eating disorder symptoms, lifetime experiences of bullying and sexual abuse and mental and physical health-related quality of life. Results: Participants who were currently obese (25.2%) or underweight (2.7%) or who reported current eating disorder symptoms (32.7%) were between 10% and 27% more likely to have experienced bullying, and obese and eating disordered participants were also 47% and 56% more likely to have experienced sexual abuse, respectively. In regard to specific symptoms, a lifetime history of bullying was associated with increased risk of obesity, extreme dieting, purging and overvaluation of body weight and/or shape, whereas a lifetime history of sexual abuse was associated with increased risk of obesity, binge eating and extreme dieting and decreased risk of underweight. Lifetime histories of bullying and sexual abuse were associated with health-related quality of life impairment; however, lifetime bullying was associated with a greater adverse impact among participants with current eating disorder symptoms.

A composite questionnaire incorporating a validated vaccine hesitancy tool was developed and administered in both English and Arabic. Approval was obtained from the local ethics committee. Participation was voluntary and offered to all adult residents of Qatar through an online link available on social media platforms and local news portals. Only adult respondents who self -iden-tified as mothers were included in the present study. No personal identifying data were collected.RESULTS: Of the mothers surveyed, 29.4% exhibited COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy regarding their children. This exceeded these mothers' rate of personal vaccine hesitancy (27.5%). Hesitancy rates varied significantly with ethnicity, with the highest among Qatari mothers (51.3%). Intention to vaccinate children did not differ significantly between mothers who accepted the vaccine for themselves and those who did not. Overall, the main reported concerns related to long-term vaccine safety. To a sig-nificant extent, mothers relied most on self-directed research on vaccine safety for decision-making.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of maternal COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy exceeded both those mothers' rate of personal vaccine hesitancy and the hesitancy rate in the general population. The intention to vaccinate children was independent of maternal vaccination history.

We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February to 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers.

We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was applied to test the association between network measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters, yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3% (95% CI, 2%-4%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF.

Objective: This study aimed to explore superusers' motivation to actively engage in OHCs, the difficulties they may face, and their interactions with health care professionals (HCPs). Methods: An asynchronous web-based structured interview study was conducted. Superusers of the Asthma UK OHC and Facebook groups were recruited through Asthma UK staff to pilot and subsequently complete the questionnaire Open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis. Results: There were 17 superusers recruited for the study (14 patients with asthma and 3 carers); the majority were female (15/17). The age range of participants was 18 to 75 years. They were active in OHCs for 1 to 6 years and spent between 1 and 20 hours per week reading and 1 and 3 hours per week writing posts. Superusers' participation in OHCs was prompted by curiosity about asthma and its medical treatment and by the availability of spare time when they were off work due to asthma exacerbations or retired. Their engagement increased over time as participants furthered their familiarity with the OHCs and their knowledge of asthma and its self-management. Financial or social recognition of the superuser role was not important; their reward came from helping and interacting with others. According to the replies provided, they showed careful judgment to distinguish what can be dealt with through peer advice and what needs input from HCPs. Difficulties were encountered when dealing with misunderstandings about asthma and its treatment, patients not seeking advice from HCPs when needed, and miracle cures or dangerous ideas. Out of 17 participants, only 3 stated that their HCPs were aware of their engagement with OHCs. All superusers thought that HCPs should direct patients to OHCs, provided they are trusted and moderated. In addition, 9 users felt that HCPs themselves should take part in OHCs. Conclusions: Superusers from a UK-wide online community are highly motivated, altruistic, and mostly female individuals who exhibit judgment about the complexity of coping with asthma and the limits of their advice. Engagement with OHCs satisfies their psychosocial needs. Future research should explore how to address their unmet needs, their interactions with HCPs, and the potential integration of OHCs in traditional healthcare.",,,,,"Pagliari, Claudia C/P-6412-2018; Sheikh, Aziz/D-2818-2009; De Simoni, Anna/AAC-2278-2020","Pagliari, Claudia C/0000-0001-5791-7723; Sheikh, Aziz/0000-0001-7022-3056; Griffiths, Chris/0000-0001-7935-8694; De Simoni, Anna/0000-0001-6955-0885; Coulson, Neil Stewart/0000-0001-9940-909X; Shah, Anjali/0000-0002-1918-6066; Fulton, Olivia/0000-0001-7358-0219",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUN 23,2020,22,6,,,,,,,e18185,10.2196/18185,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18185,,,,,,,,32573463,,,,,WOS:000599140500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, we know little about their network cohesion and its association with continuity of care. We set out to investigate this association and hypothesised that it would depend on the severity of the user's situation and on his/her living arrangements. Methods We conducted face-to-face interviews with 380 SMI users recruited in outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three areas in Belgium. Data regarding users' social networks were collected using an ego-network mapping technique and analysed with social network analysis. The cohesion indicators were density (frequency of connections between network members), centralisation (having a small number of central people), and egobetweenness (the user's centrality in his/her own network). Participants' perception of continuity of care was measured by the Alberta Continuity of Services Scale. Results Results show that cohesion indicators were associated with continuity of care only for users with high-severity problems, regardless of their living arrangements. The numbers of network members, professionals, and services in the network were all negatively associated with continuity of care for all the users. Conclusions Satisfactory continuity of care requires fewer professionals or services in a user's network and a dense network for users with the most severe problems. This implies that those providing care must not only be able to increase cohesion within a network, but also to adapt their interventions to support the transition to a different, individualised network structure when severity decreases.",,,,,"Nicaise, Pablo/H-9202-2019","/0000-0002-2663-332X; Nicaise, Pablo/0000-0001-5637-5766; Wyngaerden, Francois/0000-0002-2490-8983",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,JUN,2019,54,6,,,,,725,735,,10.1007/s00127-019-01660-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-019-01660-7,,,,,,,,30758541,,,,,WOS:000469248100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, many studies are restricted to a specific geographic location, regatta, or class of sailboat or to only professional sailors. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to gather a large database of sailing-related injuries with demographic, injury, and voyage characteristics. Methods-An observational study of self-reported offshore sailing-related injuries was performed using an internet-based, multiple-choice survey distributed on social media. Data were analyzed statistically with the use of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi 2 test. Results-Five hundred sixty-eight people completed the survey, 217 women and 351 men, with a mean age of 36.26 y (SD=13.69 y). Among reported 793 cruises, 141 resulted in injury (18%). The most frequent injury types were contusion (40%) and skin lesions and lacerations (20%); the most frequent locations were hand (28%) and foot and ankle (18%), and the most frequent mechanisms were tripping/falling (33%), being hit by an object (19%), and using ropes (19%). Sex, age, and sailing experience were not injury risk factors, while higher number of offshore days was (P=0.0004). None of the analyzed voyage characteristics (purpose, ship's class, position on the ship, ship's length overall, type of rigging, and harness wearing) were injury risk factors. Sailors perceived the following as risk factors: inattention/distraction (34%), difficult weather conditions (22%), and fatigue/lack of sleep (14%). Conclusions-Approximately 1 in 5 cruises resulted in an injury, occurring regardless of demographic, injury, and voyage characteristics. The multifactorial nature of injuries poses a challenge in implementing safety measures.

It is one of the common ear, nose, and throat emergencies, which should be managed with first-aid measures. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted among school teachers in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia regarding this information. This study thus aimed to assess levels of knowledge about first-aid management and control of epistaxis among school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia.Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study using a validated online questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms. Information was collected regarding sociodemographic characteristics, and eight items assessed participants' knowledge about epistaxis and its management. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess the factors associated with good levels of knowledge.Results: The study had a total of 1,152 participants, of which 69.7% were female. The mean of knowledge was 3.29 (SD=1.39, range: 0-7). Only 19.4% of participants had a good level of knowledge. In multivariate analysis, females and those who had received information on first aid to stop nose-bleeds were significantly associated with good knowledge levels (adjusted odds ratio {AOR}: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.18-2.51, p=0.005; and AOR: 3.38, 95% CI: 2.47-4.64, p<0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Less than one-quarter of participants had good knowledge levels.

Objectives Identify and bring awareness to the variation of neurogenic bladder management in around the world. Setting International online questionnaire. Methods A 32-question survey was drafted and circulated among a global network of SCI experts for review. The survey was disseminated to healthcare professionals involved in the care of NLUTD in SCI patients via social media, grassroots methods, and international societies. The survey was available for 6 weeks and respondents answered questions regarding SCI population demographics, access to care, common neurogenic bladder management, diagnostic and imaging methods, complications, and follow up. Results A total of 296 healthcare professionals, 132 from North America, 87 from Europe, 27 from Asia, 24 from Australia, 14 from South America, and 6 from Africa, responded to the survey. Global concurrence was noted among management method for patients without adequate hand function, first-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity, and common complications. Continents highly differed in responses regarding management method for patients with adequate hand function, frequency of patients reusing catheters, timing of urodynamics, and duration of antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections.

Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users. Setting and design We obtained data from three leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19. Primary outcome measures (1) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords; (2) proportion of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19; (3) proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to physical and mental health comorbidities. Results Data from 739 434 posts created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A total of 35 581 posts (4.8%) contained a COVID-19 keyword.

Trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial's Network (NCTN) have greater outreach to community sites, potentially allowing better representation. We compared the representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical company-sponsored cancer clinical trials with NCTN trials and with the US cancer population. Methods: We established a large cohort of study publications representing the results of trials that supported new US Food and Drug Administration drug approvals from 2008 to 2018. NCTN trial data were from the SWOG Cancer Research Network. US cancer population rates were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results survey data. We compared the proportion of Black patients by enrollment year for each cancer type and overall. Tests of proportions were used. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: A total 358 trials (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 85; SWOG trials, 273) comprised of 93 825 patients (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 46 313; SWOG trials, 47 512) for 15 cancer types were analyzed. Overall, the proportion of Black patients was 2.9% for pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 9.0% for SWOG trials, and 12.1% for the US cancer population (P<.001 for each pairwise comparison). These findings were generally consistent across individual cancer types. Conclusions: The poor representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials supporting new drug applications could result in the use of new drugs with little data about efficacy or side effects in this key population.

However, it remains to be investigated which type of RT (high loads (HLs) vs low loads (LLs)) is more efficacious in improving exercise performance, cardio-metabolic health and quality of life. Methods and analysis A randomised, controlled, clinical trial will enrol 20 patients with CAD into each of three study arms (total 60 patients): HL-RT (70%-80% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)) combined with AT; LL-RT (30%-40% of 1-RM) combined with AT and AT alone as standard care. Primary outcomes (maximal aerobic capacity, maximal leg isometric strength) will be assessed at baseline and after 36 training sessions. Other outcomes will include acute haemodynamic responses to LL-RT and HL-RT, body composition, physical performance, blood biomarkers (lipids, glucose metabolism, inflammation, growth factors), physical activity and quality of life. The intention-to-treat principle will be used to analyse the data. Ethics and dissemination The study design and protocol have been approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia (registration number: 0120573/2019/15). The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results of the study will be published as peer-reviewed manuscripts and congress presentations, communicated with patients and the clinical community, and shared through posts on social media. The findings of the study will be disseminated among the national CR clinical community (CR centres, Slovenian association of coronary clubs) with active participation of the patients enrolled in the study.

With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic and its new variants, there is an inadequate understanding on whether there are certain factors such as a specific symptom or collection of symptoms that combined with life-style behaviors may be useful to predict susceptibility. The study aims to explore such factors from pre-vaccination data to guide public health response to potential new waves. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was distributed through social media during the lockdown period in the United States from April to June 2020. Respondents were questioned regarding COVID testing, presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities, and confirmation of COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. Results: A total of 130 participants deemed as susceptible because they self-reported their perception of having COVID-19 (but without the evidence of positive test) were compared with 130 individuals with documented negative test results. Participants had a mean age of 45 years, and 165 (63%) were female. Final multivariable model showed significant associations with perceived susceptibility for the following variables: fever (OR:33.5; 95%CI: 3.9,85.9), body ache (OR:3.0; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), contact history (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), age > 50 (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1, 6.6) and smoking (OR:3.3; 95%CI: 1.2,9.1) after adjusting for other symptoms and presence of comorbid conditions. The AUROC ranged from poor to fair (0.65-0.76) for cluster of symptoms but improved to a good model (AUROC = 0.803) after inclusion of sociodemographic and lifestyle behaviors e.g., age and smoking tobacco. Conclusions: Fever and body aches suggest association with perceived COVID-19 susceptibility in the presence of demographic and lifestyle behaviors. Using other constitutional and respiratory symptoms with fever and body aches, the parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 80.3% of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. A larger cohort of respondents will be needed to study and refine classifier performance in future lockdowns and with expected surge of new variants of COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Diet may play a role in triggering the symptoms. We aimed to measure the prevalence of IBS and its types, and its association with food restrictions among the Saudi population, using the Rome IV criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient clinics of three major hospitals in Riyadh in conjunction with an electronic survey which was shared on social media. A total of 1,319 subjects (706 males and 613 females) completed a questionnaire of four domains (sociodemography, Rome IV, food restriction, and herbs) between Nov 2019 and February 2020. Convenience sampling was used.Results: IBS was diagnosed in 104 subjects (7.9%) and, of these, 52% were IBS-M (mixed) type. The prevalence was higher in women than in men (4.9% vs. 3.0%; P = 0.006). A significant association was found between the presence of IBS symptoms and low income (P = 0.010), and not working (P < 0.0001). Most of the IBS patients showed food restriction related to milk (P < 0.0001) and legumes (P = 0.0029), besides other types of food and drinks. Conclusions: IBS is less common among the Saudi population. A female gender, low family income, and working status, have the highest association with IBS.

To prevent incursions of COVID-19 in RACS in Australia, visitors were banned and aged-care workers were encouraged to work at a single site. We conducted a review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand how workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS. Design: Retrospective outbreak review. Setting and participants: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020. Methods: The Victorian Department of Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission via households. Results: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak as staff, 91 (4.5%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak through their household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were attributed to staff-household transmission. Conclusions: Limiting worker mobility through single-site policies could reduce the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS to another.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore practices of postmortem genetic testing and attitudes of health care professionals worldwide. METHODS A survey was administered among health care professionals recruited through professional associations, social media, and networks of researchers. Topics included practices around postmortem genetic testing, level of confidence in health care professionals' ability, and attitudes toward postmortem genetic testing practices. RESULTS There were 112 respondents, with 93% from North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand, and 7% from South America, Asia and Africa. Only 30% reported autopsy as mandatory, and overall practices were largely case by case and not standardized. North American respondents (87%) more often perceived practices as ineffective compared to those from Europe (58%) and Australia/ New Zealand (48%; P = .002). Where a heritable cause is suspected, 69% considered postmortem genetic testing and 61% offered genetic counseling to surviving family members. Financial resources varied widely. Half of participants believed practices in their countries perpetuated health inequalities. CONCLUSION Postmortem genetic testing is not consistently available in the investigation of young SCD despite being a recommendation in international guidelines.

To determine the effectiveness of implementing a locally developed clinical practice guideline (CPG) for antibiotic treatment in adults with community-acquired cellulitis at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods. The CPG for antibiotic treatment of community-acquired cellulitis was developed based on local data during June to December 2016. The CPG was introduced by multifaceted interventions, including posters, brochures, circular letters, social media, conference, classroom training, and interactive education during January to September 2018. Results. Among 360 patients with community-acquired cellulitis, 84.4% were ambulatory and 15.6% were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 62 years, and 59.4% were female. Antibiotic prescription according to CPG (CPG-compliant group) was observed in 251 patients (69.7%), and CPG noncompliance was found in 109 patients (30.3%) (CPG-noncompliant group). The demographics and characteristics of patients were comparable between groups. Patients in the CPG-compliant group had a significantly lower rate of intravenous antibiotics (18.7% vs 33.9%, P = .007), lower prescription rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics (14.7% vs 78.9%, P < .001) and antibiotic combination (6.4% vs 13.8%, P = .022), shorter median duration of antibiotic treatment (7 vs 10 days, P < .001), lower median cost of antibiotic treatment (US $3 vs $7, P < .001), and lower median hospitalization cost (US $601 vs $1587, P = .008) than those in the CPG-noncompliant group.

Perceived risks can impact participation. Understanding community perspectives on rugby-related SCI may provide insight for addressing concerns around risk. The aim of this study was to explore community perspectives through social media discussion about SCI in rugby union.MethodsPosts about SCI in rugby union were identified using the advanced search function on Twitter. Data (content as original post, retweet, quote tweet and comments) were included if focused on Rugby Union and written in English. Inclusion dates (July 2018 to June 2019) were chosen to capture a period when several SCI (n = 4) occurred in community rugby in Australia. Data were analysed using a thematic approach.ResultsFour themes were derived from the collected data. The 'pendulum swing' relates to the disparate views of rugby, from being overly cautious to too dangerous to play. The 'role of rugby culture' described engrained behaviours and attitudes on and off-field toward safety. 'Media influence' describes the emotive narrative used when reporting rugby-related SCI. 'After the injury' looks at expressions of sympathy and inspiration. These findings showed how individuals' views of SCI were influenced through rugby culture, trust in governing bodies and the news media.ConclusionBy 'listening in' to community views, their most pertinent safety concerns can be addressed. Both facts and fears on rugby-related SCI were evident, and these extreme views can be balanced with evidence-based education and sensible risk management.",,,,,"Fortington, Lauren/E-9002-2015","Fortington, Lauren/0000-0003-2760-9249; Badenhorst, Marelise/0000-0001-8443-9173; Morgan, Ashlee/0000-0002-6351-1313; Merrick, Nicole/0000-0002-2773-6128",,,,,,,,,,,,,2473-3938,2473-4446,,,,2023 SEP 2,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/24733938.2023.2253191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24733938.2023.2253191,,SEP 2023,,,,,,37650220,,,,,WOS:001056895700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Questionnaire was distributed through e-mails sent to all licensed jockeys, over social media and during professional and amateur race meetings. Participants: An average of 23.6% (12%-44%) Irish professional and amateur jockeys (n = 119) holding a license in 2017. Main Outcome Measures: Jockeys reported their previous concussion history, actions after their most recent concussion and responded to questions examining their knowledge and attitudes toward concussion. Results: Amateur (32.4%) and professional (19.6%) jockeys, who were never medically diagnosed over their career, suspected that they had sustained a concussion. Jockeys displayed good knowledge of concussion signs and symptoms; yet, one in 2 jockeys would continue to ride out the same day if they suspected they had a concussion. They were less likely if they had a race that day. Reasons for continuing to ride include not considering a concussion as serious (85.7%); risk of losing the ride (84.0%); not wanting to let anyone down (77.8%); and considered it a sign of weakness (74.1%). Risky behavior was more common after a suspected concussion than a medically diagnosed concussion. Conclusions: Underreporting of concussions is proposed as a serious concern, and concussion understanding and attitudes can impact reporting. To address the issue of underreporting of concussions in Irish horseracing, there is a need to educate jockeys and the wider racing community on the importance of timely concussion assessments and access to appropriate management systems.",,,,,"O'Connor, Siobhan/Q-8568-2018","O'Connor, Siobhan/0000-0002-2001-0746; Cullen, SarahJane/0000-0002-0270-2706",,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-642X,1536-3724,,,,NOV,2020,30,6,,,,,578,584,,10.1097/JSM.0000000000000658,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000658,,,,,,,,30212399,,,,,WOS:000587794700019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can assist prescribers with rapid access to up-to-date information. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the introduction of CD SS for antibiotic prescribing could have a measurable impact. However, interventions to implement them are challenging because of cultural and structural constraints, and their adoption and sustainability in routine clinical care are often limited. Preimplementation research is needed to ensure relevant adaptation and fit within the context of primary care in West Africa. Objective: This study examined the requirements for a CDSS adapted to the context of primary care in West Africa, to analyze the barriers and facilitators of its implementation and adaptation, and to ensure co-designed solutions for its adaptation and sustainable use. Methods: We organized a workshop in Burkina Faso in June 2019 with 47 health care professionals representing 9 West African countries and 6 medical specialties. The workshop began with a presentation of Antibioclic, a publicly funded CDSS for antibiotic prescribing in primary care that provides personalized antibiotic recommendations for 37 infectious diseases. Antibioclic is freely available on the web and as a smartphone app (iOS, Android). The presentation was followed by a roundtable discussion and completion of a questionnaire with open-ended questions by participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Most of the participants had access to a smartphone during their clinical consultations (35/47, 74%), but only 49% (23/47) had access to a computer and none used CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. The participants considered that CDSS could have a number of benefits including updating the knowledge of practitioners on antibiotic prescribing, improving clinical care and reducing AMR, encouraging the establishment of national guidelines, and developing surveillance capabilities in primary care. The most frequently mentioned contextual barrier to implementing a CD SS was the potential risk of increasing self-medication in West Africa, where antibiotics can be bought without a prescription. The need for the CDSS to be tailored to the local epidemiology of infectious diseases and AMR was highlighted along with the availability of diagnostic tests and antibiotics using national guidelines where available. Participants endorsed co-design involving all stakeholders, including nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, as central to any introduction of CDSS. A phased approach was suggested by initiating and evaluating CDSS at a pilot site, followed by dissemination using professional networks and social media. The lack of widespread internet access and computers could be circumvented by a mobile app with an offline mode. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information for the development and implementation of a CDSS for antibiotic prescribing among primary care prescribers in LMICs and may, in turn, contribute to improving antibiotic use, clinical outcomes and decreasing AMR.",,,,,"DELORY, Tristan/H-8110-2019; Josselin, LE BEL/GYV-2052-2022","DELORY, Tristan/0000-0002-0165-8934; Ahmad, Raheelah/0000-0002-4294-7142; Pauline, Jeanmougin/0000-0001-6505-2125; OUEDRAOGO, Abdoul-Salam/0000-0002-8539-3768; Lescure, Xavier/0000-0002-2828-125X; GUIARD-SCHMID, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0003-4995-2742",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUL 20,2020,22,7,,,,,,,e17940,10.2196/17940,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/17940,,,,,,,,32442155,,,,,WOS:000574962000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0% without diabetes). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.",,,,,"Yan, An/JPA-0307-2023; Shi, Zumin/A-1093-2009; Yan, Alice/AAC-4224-2019; Shi, Z/ISB-4324-2023","Shi, Zumin/0000-0002-3099-3299; Yan, Alice/0000-0002-3162-3687;",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5043,1439-4286,,,,MAY,2021,53,5,,,,,301,310,,10.1055/a-1468-4535,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1468-4535,,,,,,,,33962477,,,,,WOS:000648108000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the significant advantages of bedside teaching, its usage within medical education has been declining, and COVID-19 has added additional challenges. The pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in opportunities to deliver bedside teaching due to risk of viral exposure, patients declining student interactions, and ward closures. Educators have therefore been required to be innovative in their teaching methods, leading to the use of online learning, social media platforms, and simulation. Simulation-based education allows for learning in a low-risk environment and affords the opportunity for deliberated repeated practice with case standardization. The results demonstrate that simulation-based training can increase students' confidence, increase the rates of correct clinical diagnoses, and improve retention of skills and knowledge when compared with traditional teaching methods. Objective: To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 upon bedside teaching for third year students at Hull York Medical School amid closure of the cardiorespiratory wards, a high-fidelity simulation-based model of traditional bedside teaching was designed and implemented. The objectives of the teaching session were to enable students to perform history taking and a focused cardiorespiratory clinical examination in a COVID-19-safe environment using SimMan 3G. Methods: Four clinical teaching fellows with experience of simulation-based medical education scripted histories for 2 common cardiorespiratory cases, which were asthma and aortic stenosis. The simulation sessions were designed for students to take a focused cardiorespiratory history and clinical examination using SimMan 3G. All cases involved dynamic vital signs, and the simulator allowed for auscultation of an ejection systolic murmur and wheezing in accordance with the cases chosen. Key aspects of the pathologies, including epidemiology, differential diagnoses, investigations, and management, were summarized using an interactive PowerPoint presentation, followed by a debriefing session. Results: In total, 12 third year medical students undertook the sessions, and overall feedback was highly positive. Of the 10 students who completed the feedback questionnaires, 90% (n=9) felt more confident in their clinical examination skills following the teaching; 100% (n=10) of the students responded that they would recommend the session to a colleague; and implementation of regular simulation was frequently requested on feedback. These results are in keeping with the current literature. Conclusions: Bedside teaching continues to face ongoing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as declining patient recruitment and fluctuations in clinical findings. The support for simulation-based medical education is derived from high-quality studies; however, studies describing the use of this technology for bedside teaching in the undergraduate curriculum are limited. The authors describe a highly effective teaching session amid the pandemic, which allowed for maintenance of staff and student safety alongside continued education during a challenging time for educators globally.",,,,,"Zuniga, Denisse/HJY-2656-2023","Zuniga, Denisse/0000-0002-8082-8857; Pearson, Emma/0000-0003-0833-0795; Hepburn, David/0000-0002-5211-3512; Mitchell, Alicia/0000-0001-9817-6220; Ajab, Shereen/0000-0002-6077-621X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-3762,,,,,APR-JUN,2022,8,2,,,,,,,e33565,10.2196/33565,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/33565,,,,,,,,35404828,,,,,WOS:000848716700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background COVID-19 is a global life-threatening disease. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects nurses' mental health. No studies have been conducted to determine the factors that affect nurses' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. If nurses' psychological well-being is impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of nursing care and the nurses' performance may be negatively affected. Design This is a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline checklist for cross-sectional studies was used for reporting in this study. Methods The study population consisted of the nurses working in a Health Application and Research Center in Turkey. Data were collected using Google forms between June-August 2020. The study sample consisted of 295 nurses who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and used social media tools. The data were collected using a Sociodemographic Characteristics Form, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S), the Work-Life Balance (WLB) Scale and the Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale. The factors that affect psychological well-being were determined using the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results The nurses' work-life balance and psychological well-being were negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their COVID-19 phobia was mild-to-moderate level. The nurses' psychological well-being was significantly affected by the variable of neglecting life the most, followed by coronaphobia and work-life balance, which explain 75% of the variance. Conclusions This study shows that coronaphobia experienced by nurses and work-life balance was related to their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Managers should take measures (regulating the working hours) to decrease nurses' COVID-19 phobia (education, counselling or psychotherapy) and work-life imbalance. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses' peers, managers and organisations need to take into account nurses' negative emotions and behaviours and organise training programmes to help them overcome their fears, communicate clearly and provide for their basic needs. Organisations, including managers and nurses, must recognise the distress being experienced by their nurses and create safe environments in which to have significant conversations. Nurses' mental health can be screened regularly by multidisciplinary teams, psychological support can be provided when required, and working hours can be regulated through appropriate shifts and breaks that will ensure work-life balance during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses receiving emotional support from their families and friends (via chatting and sharing troubles) can also contribute positively. These measures and regulations will positively affect nurses' psychological well-being and contribute to an increase in the quality of care and nurses' performance.",,,,,"yayla, Ayşegül/AAF-8843-2019","yayla, Ayşegül/0000-0001-5382-4896",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1067,1365-2702,,,,2021 NOV,2021,30,21-22,,,,,3153,3162,,10.1111/jocn.15783,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15783,,AUG 2021,,,,,,34337812,,,,,WOS:000679841500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods A total of 319 Hurricane Maria survivor adults ages 18 and older were recruited into the Adelante Boricua study between August 2020 and October 2021. Most participants had relocated to the U.S. between 2017 and 2018. We used latent profile analysis and multinomial regression to examine the relationship of technology-based communication with depressive symptoms, well-being, cultural connection, and migration stress. Results We identified a five-class solution, consisting of (1) moderate communication (32%), (2) disengaged (24%), (3) no social media (18%), (4) daily with family in Puerto Rico (6%), and (5) daily trans-territorial (13%) typologies. Participants in the disengaged class were more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms and limited English proficiency, lower prosocial behaviors, lower levels of religiosity, lower attendance at religious services in the U.S., and less engagement in social activities, compared to participants in the Moderate Communication class. Conclusion Roughly one in four individuals in our sample reported very limited technology-based communication with friends/family in their sending and new-receiving communities.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Sledge hockey players, worldwide, across all levels of play. Participants: Sledge hockey players (ages >= 14 years) who played in the 2019 to 2020 season were recruited through email, social media, and word of mouth communication. Assessment of Risk Factors: Participant characteristics (eg, age, sex, disability) were examined as potential injury risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Injury rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) examining potential risk factors were reported based on univariate Poisson regression analyses. Injury proportions by type, location, and mechanism were described. Results: Ninety-two players initiated the survey, and 77 (83.7%) provided some injury information. Forty-seven injuries included 16 concussions in 9 of 77 players (11.7%) and 31 non-concussion injuries in 20 of 77 players (26.0%) were reported.

Indeed, as children reach adulthood, a reconsent method should be used, and data connected with samples should ideally be updated based on the children's growth and long-term results. Furthermore, because most pediatric disorders are uncommon, children's research initiatives should conform to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by worldwide scientific organizations for successfully sharing data and samples. Here, we examine how pediatric biobanks can help address some challenges to improve biomedical research for children. Indeed, modern biobanks are evolving as complex research platforms with specialized employees, dedicated spaces, information technologies services (ITS), and ethical and legal expertise. In the case of research for children, biobanks can collaborate with scientific networks (i.e., BBMRI-ERIC) and provide the collection, storage, and distribution of biosamples in agreement with international standard procedures (ISO-20387). Close collaboration among biobanks provides shared avenues for maximizing scarce biological samples, which is required to promote the translation of scientific breakthroughs for developing clinical care and health policies tailored to the pediatric population. Moreover, biobanks, through their science communication and dissemination activities (i.e., European Biobank Week), may be helpful for children to understand what it means to be engaged in a research study, allowing them to see it as a pleasant, useful, and empowering experience. Additionally, biobanks can notify each participant about which projects have been accomplished (i.e., through their websites, social media networks, etc.); they can facilitate future reconsent procedures and update sample-associated data based on the children's growth. Finally, because of the increasing interest from public and commercial organizations in research efforts that include the sharing and reuse of health data, pediatric biobanks have a crucial role in this context. Consequently, they could benefit from funding opportunities for sustaining research activities even regarding rare pediatric disorders.Conclusion: Pediatric biobanks are helpful for providing biological material for research purposes, addressing ethical and legal issues (i.e. data protection, consent, etc.), and providing control samples from healthy children of various ages and from different geographical regions and ethnicities. Therefore, it is vital to encourage and maintain children's engagement in medical research programs and biobanking activities, especially as children become adults, and reconsent procedures must be applied.",,,,,"Savoia, Fabio/IAR-6646-2023","Savoia, Fabio/0000-0001-7132-0050",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-6199,1432-1076,,,,2023 APR,2023,182,4,,,,,1459,1468,,10.1007/s00431-023-04818-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-023-04818-3,,JAN 2023,,,,,,36692622,,,,,WOS:000922286800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Online social media platforms are popular among people seeking social support regarding weight loss and sharing their weight loss experiences, which provides opportunities for learning about weight loss behaviors. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the content posted by users in the r/loseit subreddit, an online community for discussing weight loss, and online interactions were associated with their weight loss in terms of the number of replies and votes that these users received. Methods: All posts that were published before January 2018 in r/loseit were collected. We focused on users who revealed their start weight, current weight, and goal weight and were active in this online community for at least 30 days. A topic modeling technique and a hierarchical clustering algorithm were used to obtain both global topics and local word semantic clusters. Finally, we used a regression model to learn the association between weight loss and topics, word semantic clusters, and online interactions. Results: Our data comprised 477,904 posts that were published by 7660 users within a span of 7 years. We identified 25 topics, including food and drinks, calories, exercises, family members and friends, and communication. Our results showed that the start weight (beta=.823; P<.001), active days (beta=.017; P=.009), and median number of votes (beta=.263; P=.02), mentions of exercises (beta=.145; P<.001), and nutrition (beta=.120; P<.001) were associated with higher weight loss. Users who lost more weight might be motivated by the negative emotions (beta=-.098; P<.001) that they experienced before starting the journey of weight loss. In contrast, users who mentioned vacations (beta=-.108; P=.005) and payments (beta=-.112; P=.001) tended to experience relatively less weight loss. Mentions of family members (beta=-.031; P=.03) and employment status (beta=-.041; P=.03) were associated with less weight loss as well. Conclusions: Our study showed that both online interactions and offline activities were associated with weight loss, suggesting that future interventions based on existing online platforms should focus on both aspects. Our findings suggest that online personal health data can be used to learn about health-related behaviors effectively.",,,,,"Yin, Zhijun/AAL-3193-2020","Liu, Yang/0000-0002-3678-9248; Yin, Zhijun/0000-0002-3075-1337",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JUN 8,2020,22,6,,,,,,,e13745,10.2196/13745,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/13745,,,,,,,,32510460,,,,,WOS:000538696300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the available studies have focused on specific common comorbidities and their association with CU, but have seldom reported the overall burden of comorbidities.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate and analyze self-reported comorbidities in Polish patients with CU. Methods: An anonymous online survey consisting of 20 questions was conducted on members of an Urticaria group on the social media platform Facebook. A total of 102 people took part in this survey. The results were analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2016.Results: In the group, 95.1% were females and 4.9% males, with a mean age of 33.8 years. The most common diagnosed type of urticaria was spontaneous (52.9%). Angioedema accompanied urticaria in 68.6% of the respondents, mainly those with delayed pressure urticaria (86.4%). 85.3% of respon-dents reported comorbidities, most often atopic diseases and allergies (49%), chronic inflammation and infections (36.3%), thyroid (36.3%) and psychiatric disorders (25.5%). Moreover, in 30.4% of patients, at least one autoimmune disease was noted. As compared to the patients without autoim-mune urticaria, many more with autoimmune urticaria had a coexisting autoimmune disease (50% vs. 23.7%). Family history of autoimmune diseases was positive in 42.2%, and the familial history of urticaria and atopy was positive in 7.8% and 25.5%, respectively.Conclusions: The knowledge of comorbidities of chronic urticaria may support clinicians to manage and treat patients with this common condition.",,,,,"Trzeciak, Magdalena/AAH-6801-2019","Trzeciak, Magdalena/0000-0002-8206-8441; Zysk, Weronika/0000-0001-7439-8881",,,,,,,,,,,,,2160-9381,,,,,JAN,2023,13,1,,,,,,,e2023056,10.5826/dpc.1301a56,http://dx.doi.org/10.5826/dpc.1301a56,,,,,,,,36892341,,,,,WOS:000972717800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to examine the preferences of MSM on performing anal self-examination to detect anal syphilis. Methods An online survey with a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was distributed to MSM attending a sexual health clinic and through social media in Australia between June and November 2020. The DCE examined the preferred attributes of anal self-examination that would encourage MSM to perform anal self-examination. Data were analysed using a random parameters logit (RPL) model. Findings The median age of 557 MSM who completed the survey was 35 (inter quartile range, 27-45). The choice to perform anal self-examination was most influenced by two attributes: the accuracy of anal self-examination to diagnose anal syphilis, and the frequency of anal self-examination, followed by the type of instruction materials to perform anal self-examination, waiting time for medical review, and type of support received if abnormalities were found. Using the most preferred attributes, 98% of people would conduct anal self-examination compared with 35% when the least preferred anal self-examination attributes were offered. Interpretation If anal self-examination were recommended for anal syphilis screening, it will be important to consider preferences of MSM: men were more likely to undertake anal self-examination if the frequency was once a month and there was higher accuracy of detecting anal syphilis.

PurposeWe have undertaken a global survey to assess the variability of management practices of PTS and PTE and highlight the pressing need to formulate uniform practice guidelines. MethodsA questionnaire consisting of sixteen questions were developed with the help of Google survey and sent through e-mail, or social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger or Telegram, to practicing Neurologists and Neurosurgeons round the world. ResultsThere were a total of 220 responses. Majority of our responders (n = 202; 91.8%) would start an anti-epileptic (AED) prophylaxis to prevent PTS; 18 people (8.18%) told that they would not start AED prophylaxis for TBI.

Food oral immunotherapy (food-OIT) has emerged as an active form of treatment, with multiple benefits such as increasing the threshold of reactivity to the allergenic food, decreasing reaction severity on accidental exposures, expanding dietary choices, reducing anxiety and generally improving quality of life. Risks associated with food immunotherapy mostly consist of allergic reactions during therapy. While the therapy is generally considered both safe and effective, patients and families must be informed of the aforementioned risks, understand them, and be willing to accept and hedge these risks as being worthwhile and outweighed by the anticipated benefits through a process of shared decision-making. Food-OIT is a good example of a preference-sensitive care paradigm, given candidates for this therapy must consider multiple trade-offs for what is considered an optional therapy for food allergy compared with avoidance. Additionally, clinicians who discuss OIT should remain increasingly aware of the growing impact of social media on medical decision-making and be prepared to counter misconceptions by providing clear evidence-based information during in-person encounters, on their website, and through printed information that families can take home and review.",,,,,"Rodriguez del Rio, Pablo/P-6184-2019","Rodriguez del Rio, Pablo/0000-0002-0783-1988",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-9888,1468-2044,,,,2024 JAN 12,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1136/archdischild-2023-326225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2023-326225,,JAN 2024,,,,,,38216305,,,,,WOS:001142635100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: Nationwide, cross-sectional, questionnaire. Methods: Participants were recruited via advertisements circulated through social media, community presentations and equestrian organisations. Participants were sent a web link to an online questionnaire previously designed for high school athletes and modified to ensure relevance to equestrian activities. The percentage of correct responses per item and a total knowledge score were calculated. Differences in concussion knowledge by age, sex, level of experience and previous history of concussion were explored using t-tests, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and effect sizes. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 1486 participants (Mean age = 39.1 +/- 15.4). Knowledge of what concussion was, how to recognise it and key symptoms (except poor sleep) was high (>80%). In contrast, awareness of guidelines was moderate (56%) and inability of helmets to prevent concussion was low (12%). Significantly higher levels of knowledge of concussion were identified in females compared with males (t=-6.55 p <0.001, 95%CI=-3.26 to -1.75). The majority (87%) of participants reported that a helmet should be replaced after a fall, yet 46% reported re-using a helmet following a hit to the head. Conclusions: Knowledge of and attitudes towards concussion were positive. However, there were knowledge gaps and discrepancies between some attitudes and behaviour on some aspects of concussion. Targeted campaigns to promote awareness of concussion and improve recognition and onward management are needed. Education related to equestrian activities such as helmet use and injury mechanisms is needed to change behaviour and minimise the risk of injury. (C) 2020 Sports Medicine Australia.

However, few data exist that examine the lasting effects of injuries in retired gymnasts. Objective To examine pain interference among former collegiate gymnasts. Specifically, we focused on the relationship between gymnastics-related injuries sustained during middle/high school or college that required surgery and former collegiate gymnasts' current pain. We hypothesized that injuries requiring surgery would be associated with increased pain and reduced function after retirement. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting An online questionnaire was distributed to former female collegiate gymnasts via social media. Participants A total of 447 former female collegiate gymnasts completed the survey and were grouped according to whether they indicated an injury during their middle/high school or collegiate gymnastics career that required surgery. Main Outcome Measures The association between current pain interference (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] scale) and injuries in middle/high school or college that resulted in surgery. Pain interference elements included current enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, participation in day-to-day activities, enjoyment of recreational activities, ability to perform errands, and ability to socialize with others. Results Those who reported an injury that resulted in surgery (n = 260; mean current age +/- SD = 32.8 +/- 9.5 years) were younger than those who did not at the time of survey completion (n = 187; current age: 37.0 +/- 11.0 years) and reported beginning gymnastics at an earlier age (4.4 +/- 2.0 years vs. 5.1 +/- 2.5 years; p = .001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on any PROMIS questions. In secondary analyses, we found a small but significant association between beginning gymnastics at an earlier age and the odds of requiring surgery (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.21; p = .02).

Early and accurate diagnosis is important to ensure patients receive psoriasis specific treatment and monitoring. It is recognised that the physical, psychological, quality of life, financial and comorbid burden of psoriasis are significant. The aim of this study is to develop clinical examination and history-based diagnostic criteria for psoriasis in children to help differentiate psoriasis from other scaly inflammatory rashes. The criteria tested in this study were developed through a consensus study with a group of international psoriasis experts (International Psoriasis Council). Methods and analysis Children and young people (<18 years) with psoriasis (cases) and other scaly inflammatory skin diseases (controls) diagnosed by a dermatologist are eligible for recruitment. All participants complete a single research visit including a diagnostic criteria assessment by a trained investigator blinded to the participant's diagnosis. The reference standard of a dermatologist's diagnosis is extracted from the medical record. Sensitivity and specificity of the consensus derived diagnostic criteria will be calculated and the best predictive criteria developed using multivariate logistic regression. Ethics and dissemination Health Regulatory Authority and National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approvals were granted in February 2017 (REC Ref: 17/EM/0035). Dissemination will be guided by stakeholders; patients, children and young people, dermatologists, primary care and paediatric rheumatologists. The aim is to publish the study results in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal, present the findings at international academic meetings and disseminate more widely through social media and working with patient associations.

PID is also associated with an increased risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Early diagnosis and treatment of PID is crucial to prevent complications. Despite the severe consequences of PID, many women are unaware of the risks associated with this condition. This lack of awareness can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of complications. This study explores women's knowledge and attitudes regarding PID.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted using a bilingual, community-based questionnaire, circulated using different social media platforms. A total of 239 participants were selected through convenient non-probability sampling from the public in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp. Released 2019. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The chi-square test was applied to determine the differences between knowledge and attitude levels with participants' socio-demographic characteristics. A p-value <0.005 was considered statistically significant.ResultsAppropriate PID knowledge level was found only in 32% of the respondents and was significantly associated with the respondents' family history of the PID (p=0.025). A positive attitude toward PID/STI was also observed only in 36% of the study participants, which was significantly associated with the respondents' age (p`0.001), marital status (p`0.001), occupation (p` 0.001), past medical/surgical history (p=0.006), and family history of the PID (p`0.009).ConclusionThe present study reported average levels of appropriate knowledge and attitudes toward PID among female respondents, which could be further improved by increasing PID/STI awareness programs.",,,,,"Zafar, Mubashir/Q-4625-2019; Syed Khaja, Azharuddin Sajid/AAF-2693-2021; SALEEM, MOHD/AAF-2697-2021","Zafar, Mubashir/0000-0002-7440-0635; Syed Khaja, Azharuddin Sajid/0000-0003-1594-1826; SALEEM, MOHD/0000-0003-2813-6279",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,SEP 11,2023,15,9,,,,,,,e45013,10.7759/cureus.45013,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.45013,,,,,,,,37829952,,,,,WOS:001082659100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at degree-granting institutions in North Carolina. Participants were recruited using targeted Instagram advertisements. The survey queried several aspects of participants' sexual behavior, including sex drive, level of sexual experience, number of sexual partners, digital sexual experience, dating patterns, and types of contraception used. Participants were asked to compare many of these behaviors before and after the pandemic. The survey also assessed several sociodemographic factors that we hypothesized would be associated with contraceptive use based on prior data, including educational background, sexual orientation and gender minority status (ie, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer), health insurance status, race, ethnicity, degree of sensation seeking, religiosity, and desire to become pregnant.Results: Over 10 days, 2035 Instagram users began our survey, of whom 1002 met eligibility criteria. Of these 1002 eligible participants, 934 completed the survey, for a 93% completion rate. Our respondents were mostly female (665/934, 71%), cisgender (877/934, 94%), heterosexual (592/934, 64%), white (695/934 75%), not Hispanic (835/934, 89%), and enrolled at a 4-year college (618/934, 66%). Over 95% (895/934) of respondents reported that they maintained access to their preferred contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a multivariable analysis, participants who were enrolled in a 4-year college or graduate program were less likely to lose contraceptive access when compared to participants enrolled in a 2-year college (risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71); in addition, when compared to cisgender participants, nonbinary and transgender participants were more likely to lose contraceptive access (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.01-5.87). Respondents reported that they were more interested in using telehealth to access contraception during the pandemic. The contraceptive methods most commonly used by our participants were, in order, condoms (331/934, 35.4%), oral contraception (303/934, 32.4%), and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC; 221/934, 23.7%). The rate of LARC use among our participants was higher than the national average for this age group (14%). Emergency contraception was uncommonly used (25/934, 2.7%).Conclusions: Undergraduate and graduate students in North Carolina overwhelmingly reported that they maintained access to their preferred contraceptive methods during the COVID-19 pandemic and through changing patterns of health care access, including telehealth. Gender nonbinary and transgender students and 2-year college students may have been at greater risk of losing access to contraception during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,"Mondaca Gómez, Katherine/JED-5127-2023; Bentley-Edwards, Keisha/N-6387-2014","Hollowell, Adam/0000-0001-7748-5665; erkanli, alaattin/0000-0002-5437-4900; Bentley-Edwards, Keisha/0000-0001-8430-4850; Myers, Evan/0000-0002-9053-9864; Chen, Emily/0000-0002-3669-0846",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2561-326X,,,,,2023,7,,,,,,,,,10.2196/38491,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/38491,,,,,,,,36827491,,,,,WOS:000998490100021,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is a recurrent multifactorial problem that is caused by the interaction of several environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of renal stones among local residents in Saudi Arabia in order to renew the statistics of renal stones occurrence in the current Saudi population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic questionnairethat was distributed randomly through phones and social media to reach the local residents in Saudi Arabia. We then reviewed the published papers in Saudi journals for patients with renal stones. Results: From a total of 580 responders to the electronic questionnaire, the prevalence of renal stones was 9.1% (n = 64). The median age at diagnosis was 29 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 36.91 years (SD = 18.66, Range of 20-99). Two peaks of age were observed, the first peak was at the (21-25) age group representing 34.4% of the kidney stones patients. The second peak was older than 47 years. The majority of those diagnosed with kidney stones had normal BMI (n = 29, 45.3%), and the family history of kidney stones among first degree relatives was found in 35.9% of the cases (n = 23). Conclusion: Kidney stones is a common health problem with the local incidence being underreported. In our sample, the prevalence was 9.1%. We also observed a relatively high percentage of positive family history among renal stone patients (34.9%) that could be attributed to the high rates of consanguinity.

We assessed the general population of Pune after visiting tertiary care hospital for their willingness to accept the vaccine and the reason for their hesitancy and refusal.Methodology: A six-month descriptive cross-sectional study with 386 community members over the age of 18 who visited the Tertiary Hospital OPD was conducted. The vaccine acceptance and hesitancy was assessed using a self designed detailed questionnaire with a one-time face-to-face interview.Results: Acceptance for vaccine was observed in 235 (60.8%) participants, while 151 (39.2%) hesitated and refused. Participants with lower education (P < 0.00001), no employment did not readily accept the vaccine (P < 0.00001). Pregnant, breast-feeding women (21.8%) hesitated vaccine because of lack of evidence regarding vaccine safety. Participants (73.6%) were readily accepting (third dose) booster dose of vaccine when available. The reason for vaccine hesitance was the concern about side effects (58.2%) and reason for acceptance was to get immunity against COVID-19 (76.1%). Vaccine information source appears to be an influential aspect, as participants who obtained vaccination information from healthcare providers had no concerns regarding vaccination.Conclusion: The study has found a link between average education level, unemployment and vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy include lack of vaccine information, vaccine side effects, and misinformation spread via social media.

In order to better understand patient perceptions, qualitative analysis using focus groups is an underutilized tool for obtaining patient perspectives regarding health-related issues and access to care. Our aim was to better understand patient perceptions using qualitative analysis. Methods: Three focus groups were held in rural counties within West Virginia in order to better understand patient perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs regarding breast health, breast cancer, access to breast reconstruction, and how to disseminate and educate this patient population regarding their right to accessing breast reconstruction. Results: Major themes analyses revealed perceived barriers to care related to lacking care coordination, lack of insurance coverage and other resources, as well as issues related to transportation. Participants consistently discussed avoiding breast screening care due fear and denial in addition to pain. Few patients were aware of their right to accessing breast reconstruction per the WHCRA, and many were concerned about follow-up burden, complications, and general fear related to breast reconstruction. Themes related to dissemination of information to promote the option of breast reconstruction included social media, patient counseling by their referring physician, and other means of intervention in clinics and other points in the care coordination chain. Conclusions: Rural women have important, unique viewpoints regarding access to and perceived barriers from obtaining breast reconstruction.

Objectives: This study assessed the knowledge of the causes of skin cancer and awareness of preventative m ca res in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 529 participants in a WhatsApp group over 3 months. Consenting participants completed a validated, 18-item questionnaire. Results: Of 529 total participants, nearly 55% of participants reported an awareness of skin cancer, 35% understood its metastasis and 55.1% knew about its spread. However, 44% of participants were unaware of the different types of the disease. Social media was reported to be the most common source of information. The majority of participants were able to identify symptoms of skin cancer and had knowledge of risk factors. Most participants understood proper preventative measures, and reported that they use sunscreen regularly. Conclusions: The general knowledge of skin cancer in Saudi Arabia is not high but is increasing. However sun-protective behaviors are lacking, despite the population's knowledge of the benefits. Awareness campaigns and incentive programs may encourage better preventative behavior.

The teachers who were provided previous information were the ones who opted to search for the tooth fragment (p=0.036) in cases of crown fracture, and for the lost tooth (p = 0.025) in cases of avulsion. They were also the ones who chose to wash the tooth in running water (p = 0.018), and look for a dentist in the first 30 or 60 minutes after the trauma (p = 0.026). Most of the teachers assessed did not have adequate knowledge of dental trauma. Having previous information was associated with more assertive practices in trauma management.",,,,,"Campos, Marcio/H-5820-2012","Campos, Marcio/0000-0003-3217-9001; Campos Machado, Fernanda/0000-0002-7138-2670; Faria Carrada, Camila/0000-0002-3173-2904",,,,,,,,,,,,,1807-3107,,,,,,2023,37,,,,,,,,e073,10.1590/1807-3107bor-2023.vol37.0073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2023.vol37.0073,,,,,,,,37436296,,,,,WOS:001149696400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities.

Research is needed into drivers of the HIV epidemic for TW, including longitudinal studies to identify risks for incident HIV infection and optimal intervention targets. This formative research sought to understand TW's experiences with, perceptions of and barriers and facilitators to HIV research participation to inform future research implementation. Design Between August 2017 and January 2018, five online synchronous computer-mediated focus groups were conducted in English and two in Spanish. Recruitment used a mixed format of technology, such as geotargeted social media, and non-technology infused methods, such as peer referrals. Maximum variation sampling was used to enrol participants across a wide range of characteristics. Qualitative codes were iteratively developed and applied to focus group discussion transcripts by independent analysts. Setting Participants were recruited from Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City and Washington D.C. Participants Participants identified as TW >= 18 years and resided in one of the six metropolitan areas or outlying regions. 33 participants elected to partake in English focus groups and eight participated in Spanish-led groups. Results The geographically diverse sample had a mean age of 41.1 years (SD=13.6), and 34% identified as Black African American and 29% as Hispanic/Latina. Social and economic factors were found to shape HIV research participation for TW. Barriers to HIV research participation included limited research opportunities, mistrust, fear of mistreatment, safety and confidentiality, competing priorities and HIV stigma. Facilitators to HIV research participation were peer involvement and engagement, monetary and non-monetary incentives, flexibility and choices, multiple modalities and methods, and transcenteredness. Conclusion It is critical to address the social and economic vulnerabilities surrounding HIV research participation for TW. Results from this study can inform the design and implementation of gender-affirming and culturally tailored approaches to HIV research with TW.",,,,,,"Garrison-Desany, Henri/0000-0003-4164-7065; Chaudhry, Aeysha/0000-0001-5367-0217; Cooney, Erin/0000-0001-9563-1822; Juarez Chavez, Elisa/0000-0003-4831-7296",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,JAN,2020,10,1,,,,,,,e029852,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029852,,,,,,,,31959600,,,,,WOS:000519306600136,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: The procedures included selection of three districts, compilation of a list of accessible venues where FSW congregate, distribution of first unique objects (first capture) and second unique objects (second capture) to FSW in randomly selected venues and implementation of a Mini-Respondent Driven Sampling (mRDS) Survey (third capture). Population size of the FSW was calculated based on the number of FSW in each round, number of FSW 'recaptured' during the second and the third captures. Additionally, personal network size data captured in the mRDS was used to measure the population of FSW within the three districts using Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates (SS-PSE). Results: The total estimated FSWs in the three selected districts, using Three Source Capture-Recapture (3S-CRC) was 958, which is slightly lower than that estimated using SS-PSE - 1192. The 3S-CRC method yielded a provincial estimate of 1911 while the SS-PSE method resulted in a total of 2379 FSW for the province. Conclusion: Two techniques produced different PSE at both the district and the province levels and resulted in estimates lower than ones produced using programmatic data. For planning HIV prevention and care service needs among all FSWs, additional studies are needed to estimate the number of sex workers who are not venue-based and use social media platforms to sell services.

This study was carried out to map the factors influencing mpox vaccination uptake to help address the challenges and increase vaccination confidence.MethodsThis was a study based on Tweet analysis. The VADER, Text Blob, and Flair analyzers were adopted for sentiment analysis. The Levesque conceptual framework for healthcare access was adopted to evaluate the factors impacting access and the decision to get mpox vaccination. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) criteria were adopted.FindingsA total of 149,133 tweets were extracted between 01/05/2022 and 23/09/2022. Around 1% of the random tweets were used for qualitative analysis. Of the 149,113, tweets were classified as positive, negative and neutral, respectively, by (a) VADER: (55,040) 37.05%, (44,395) 29.89%, and (49,106) 33.06%, (b) TextBlob: (70,900) 47.73%, (22,729) 15.30%, and (54,921) 36.97%, and (c) Flair: (31,389) 21.13%, (117,152) 78.87%, and 0.00%.

We analysed population response to online promotion of an educational tool built by the Ask About Aspirin campaign in the USA to inform people about aspirin as a preventive aid. Methods We collected 156 weeks of time series data on audience behaviour, namely use of a self-assessment tool. We then used the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling to predict that outcome as a function of paid search engine advertising, paid social media promotion and general search interest in aspirin. Results Through ARIMA modelling of tool engagement data adjusted for outcome series autocorrelation, we found a significant effect of online promotional effort on audience behaviour. Total paid search advertising positively predicted weekly total of individuals who started using the self-assessment tool, coefficient=0.023, t=3.28, p=0.001. This effect did not appear to be an artefact of broader secular trends, as Google search data on the topic of aspirin use did not add explanatory power in the final model nor did controlling for general search interest eliminate the significant coefficient for paid search promotion. Conclusion Results hold implications both for educational tool development and for understanding health promotion campaign effects. We witnessed substantial but ephemeral effects on tool use as a function of paid search efforts, suggesting prioritisation of efforts to affect search engine results as a dissemination tactic.",,,,,"Duval, Susan/AAI-1874-2020; Eder, Milton/AAJ-2435-2020","Eder, Milton/0000-0002-4036-6491; Duval, Sue/0000-0003-1025-8665; Southwell, Brian/0000-0001-5091-8782",,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-005X,1470-2738,,,,NOV,2018,72,11,,,,,1059,1063,,10.1136/jech-2018-210676,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2018-210676,,,,,,,,30082425,,,,,WOS:000450417500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

A protocol to derive a clinical decision rule for the emergency department,BMJ OPEN,,,,,,,,,,,,"Introduction Falling on level ground is now the most common cause of traumatic intracranial bleeding worldwide. Older adults frequently present to the emergency department (ED) after falling. It can be challenging for clinicians to determine who requires brain imaging to rule out traumatic intracranial bleeding, and often head injury decision rules do not apply to older adults who fall. The goal of our study is to derive a clinical decision rule, which will identify older adults who present to the ED after a fall who do not have clinically important intracranial bleeding. Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study enrolling patients aged 65 years or older, who present to the ED of 11 hospitals in Canada and the USA within 48 hours of having a fall. Patients are included if they fall on level ground, off a chair, toilet seat or out of bed. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of clinically important intracranial bleeding within 42 days of the index ED visit. An independent adjudication committee will determine the primary outcome, blinded to all other data. We are collecting data on 17 potential predictor variables. The treating physician completes a study data form at the time of initial assessment, prior to brain imaging. Data extraction is supplemented by an independent, structured electronic medical record review. We will perform binary recursive partitioning using Classification and Regression Trees to derive a clinical decision rule.

The advent of social media has been a double-edged sword by the way it has brought us closer and also resulted in anonymous ways of mental distress to children, which is already being tested by violent school environments and pressure to succeed resulting in the prevalence of different mental illness. Parents and school authorities should ensure that their children grow and thrive in the best and safest environment possible. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Mental Health Programme on promoting mental health characteristics among adolescents in a school located in Coimbatore. Method: A quasi experimental one group pre-test and post-test design was adapted for the study. A sample of 195 students were selected using stratified random proportionate sampling technique and made to answer the pre-test questionnaire followed by the mental health programme intervention. They were then made to answer the post-test questionnaire and the data was analysed. The data collection was initiated on June 2015 and ended on October 2016, the entire process took approximately 48 weeks excluding holidays and examinations. Result: The pre-test mean score was 8.35 +/- 3.02 and the post-test mean score was 26.77 +/- 2.94 with a mean gain score of 18.42.

Each component of HIPAA was discussed, including transactions, privacy, and security rules. We have discussed the enforcement component and how enforcement and audits have increased with sizable penalties for disclosures by organizations across the United States. In addition, we have examined other regulatory requirements, including state laws that can override federal law when considered more stringent with respect to protections. We have also discussed the importance of public trust and nursing roles that are important for establishing strong policies and procedures in protecting the PHI and identity of individuals whom we care for on a daily basis. Most issues with security breaches are related to vulnerabilities created by human errors; therefore, we have also related common incidences of HIPAA violations and reviewed why they occurred and how to mitigate these types of incidents while emphasizing the importance of SRAs in that process. Population health data and the  push and pull between protecting privacy and disclosing adequate information to address epidemiologic and other research questions were discussed. Also examined was whether we as a nation have the right balance between open government and public disclosure of healthcare data for the common good versus potential risks of disclosing public domain data that might be used to identify individuals. New threats regarding cybersecurity were reviewed with special attention as to why these new threats are occurring, what they are, and what we can do as an industry to guard against these -exposures. Technical terms related to cybersecurity were noted and used within the context of threats that all healthcare professionals should be aware of to help guard against disclosures.

The rising internet and media penetration and online news contents are likely to shape the public vaccine sentiments and attitude. The measles-rubella immunization campaign in India experienced challenges in some states due to the social media and messaging. This study studied the profile and vaccine sentiments of the online media news in India. Methods: We retrieved the online news on immunization and vaccines published in English during November 2015 to May 2020. The news were analysed for contents and categorised as positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Results: Out of 2626 news retrieved, 1788 eligible ones were analysed. The news focused on immunization program in 59.1% and vaccine hesitancy in 7.7% items. While 42.5% news originated from national level, 33.2% were from six states. Measles-rubella was the leading vaccine in the news (23.2%) followed by coronavirus (12.8%), poliomyelitis (10.4%) and rotavirus (5.1%) vaccines. While 71.4% news conveyed positive sentiment, 23.8% and 4.7% had negative and neutral sentiments, respectively. The negative sentiments focused on adverse events, vaccine hesitancy and resistance. The news volume and negative sentiments were largely linked to the measles-rubella vaccination campaign phases in India. Conclusions: Negative vaccine news constitute a sizable proportion of the online news and can influence the public vaccine sentiment and attitude. The experiences of public response towards measles-rubella, pentavalent and human papillomavirus vaccines suggest necessity of comprehensive media mapping and tracking to guide appropriately to sustain the public vaccine confidence and improve coverage.",,,,,"Das, Manoja/I-2558-2017","Das, Manoja/0000-0002-8559-5837; Singh, Deepak/0000-0002-3058-0064",,,,,,,,,,,,,2452-0918,2213-3984,,,,2021 APR-JUN,2021,10,,,,,,,,100691,10.1016/j.cegh.2020.100691,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.100691,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000639293000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Stone development does not initially result in any symptoms, but later renal colic, flank pain, hematuria, obstruction of urine flow, and/or hydronephrosis may indicate renal stone disease. In addition to age, gender, ethnicity, and local climate, urolithiasis can be caused by several other factors. The prevalence and recurrence rate of kidney stone disease is rising globally, while few effective treatment options currently exist. Methods: Between June and October 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted. An electronic questionnaire subdivided into three categories was used to determine the prevalence and identify the factors that increase the likelihood of developing urolithiasis among the population in Bisha. The collected data were reviewed and analyzed via IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Results: A total of 1,002 participants filled out the questionnaire. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to over 60 years, with an average age of 26.1 & PLUSMN; 13.9 years. There were 451 female participants (45%), and 927 (92.5%) were Saudis. According to the participants' body mass index, 98 (9.8%) were underweight, 388 (38.7%) were normal weight, 300 (29.9%) were overweight, and 216 (21.6%) were obese. The total number of participants with urolithiasis was 161 (16.1%), and 420 (41.9%) had a family history of renal stones. Urolithiasis was found to be significantly associated with family history, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, gout, and chronic kidney disease. Older age and female gender were also associated with the risk of having urolithiasis. Conclusion: This study found urolithiasis to be highly prevalent among the Bisha population. In terms of risk factors, body mass index, smoking, and diabetes were the most significant. Based on the findings of this study, the authors recommend more public education regarding urolithiasis and its risk factors, emphasizing the importance of preventing the disease and the ways of treating urolithiasis through medical campaigns and social media.",,,,,,"Aldarwish, Hadi/0000-0002-8792-8412",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,JUN 7,2023,15,6,,,,,,,,10.7759/cureus.40090,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.40090,,,,,,,,37425544,,,,,WOS:001023417800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The event was witnessed by at least 250 survivors and also live streamed on social media, leading to widespread and repeated exposure within the community. It is expected that survivors, families and community members will be at increased risk of developing mental disorders due to the scale and violence of these attacks. This protocol describes the first phase of a proposed longitudinal study to screen and assess the long-term impacts of the terrorist attack on members of the Christchurch Muslim community, to determine clinical need and facilitate access to appropriate interventions and to gain insights into working with such a traumatised, ethnically diverse population. It has been developed in close collaboration with members of that community. Methods and analysis A mixed-method design is described, combining self-report measures with a clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Participants include Christchurch Muslims aged 18 years and over, with a target sample size of n=200. Analyses will determine prevalence of major mental disorders, while regression analyses will model the relationship between pre-event features, trauma exposure and mental disorders. A small number of participants, stratified by exposure type, will also take part in a qualitative interview in English.

Despite multiple expert-led dog bite prevention schemes being available, there is limited evidence regarding the surrounding factors and likely causes of a dog bite (e.g., dog/human behavior). An online convenience sample questionnaire was distributed through social media between December 2015 and February 2016 targeting self-identified dog bite victims within the United Kingdom. A total of 484 responses were received. Victims were aged between 1 and 77 years when bitten. Most dogs (66.1%) were known to the victim. The most common context of a dog bite is related to interacting or attempting to interact with the dog (e.g., stroking, playing, handling, and restraining); however, in many cases, the dog approached the victim (50%). In 27% of cases, the dog was known to have bitten someone previously. If the upper extremities were bitten, it was likely the person approached the dog, whereas for the lower extremities, it was more likely the dog approached the person. Most injuries did not require medical treatment (62.3%), and there was no follow-on consequence for the dog involved (59.9%). Bites to an owner from their own dog were more likely to be seen as accidental and unintentional than bites from a less familiar dog. This study found contexts in which dog bites occur vary widely, and thus, a number of different prevention measures are required, including addressing repeat biters. (C) 2017 The Authors.

A world-based survey on severe traumatic brain injury,JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is going to be the third-leading cause of death worldwide, according to the WHO. Two European surveys suggested that adherence to brain trauma guidelines is poor. No study has compared compliance between low-(LMICs) and high-income (UHICs) countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate differences in the management of severe TBI patients, comparing low-and high-income, and adherence to the BTF guidelines. METHODS: A web-based survey was spread through the Global Neuro Foundation, different neurosurgical societies, and social media. RESULTS: A total of 803 neurosurgeons participated: 70.4 from UHICs and 29.6% from LMICs. Hypertonic was administered as an early measure by the 73% and 65% of the responders in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P=0.016). An invasive intracranial pressure monitoring was recommended by the 66% and 58% of the neurosurgeons in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P<0.001). Antiseizure drugs (P<0.001) were given most frequently in LMICs as, against recommendations, steroids (87% vs. 61% and 86% vs. 81%, respectively). In the LMICs both the evacuation of the contusion and decompressive craniectomy were performed earlier than in UHICs (30% vs. 17% with P<0.001 and 44% vs. 28% with P=0.006, respectively). In the LMICs, the head CT control was performed mostly between 12 and 24 hours from the first imaging (38% vs. 23%, P<0.001).

ZIKV can primarily spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Till now, ZIKV is considered an incurable infectious disease. As Zika is an emerging disease of an international concern with the ongoing speculation about a potential outbreak in India in the future, the present study was conducted with an aim to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding ZIKV among nursing students. Materials and Methods: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 240 nursing students during 2019, and data were collected using a pretested, predesigned, standardized, and self-administered questionnaire. The ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical committee before the conduct of the study. All tests were performed at 5% level of significance. Results: The present study has included 240 nursing students (228 female students and 12 male students). The most common source of information related to ZIKV was social media among 75.6% of the students and 46.7% of the participants has low knowledge regarding ZIKV. Surprisingly, about one-tenth of the participants (14.2%) made an attempt to gain more knowledge about ZIKV, and nearly one-fifth of the participants were not using any method at all (17.1%) to prevent mosquito bites. Conclusion: This study showed inadequate knowledge among nursing students which will be future health care providers about ZIKV infection. The awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and maintained among health care providers to face any possible emergence in the region.

Socio-environmental factors are important predictors of perinatal mental health, but the effects of the environment on mental health are heterogeneous. The differential susceptibility theory and the environmental sensitivity framework suggest that individuals differ in their degree of sensitivity to positive and negative environments, which can be captured by individual phenotypes such as temperament and personality. While there is strong evidence for these models in childhood, few studies examined them in adults, and they were not examined in pregnancy.Objective: The primary objective of the Experiences of Pregnancy study is to explore whether childhood and current environments are associated with mental health and well-being in pregnancy and whether these effects depend on individual sensitivity phenotypes (personality). This study also aims to gather important psychosocial and health data for potential secondary data analyses and integrative data analyses. Methods: We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study. The study was not registered elsewhere, other than this protocol. Participants will be recruited through social media advertisements linking to the study website, followed by an eligibility call on Zoom (Zoom Video Communications). Participants must be aged 18 years or older, currently residing in the United States as citizens or permanent residents, and currently planning to continue the pregnancy. A minimum of 512 participants will be recruited based on power analyses for the main objectives. Since the data will also be a resource for secondary analyses, up to 1000 participants will be recruited based on the available budget. Participants will be in their first trimester of pregnancy, and they will be followed at each trimester and once post partum. Data will be obtained through self-reported questionnaires assessing demographic factors; pregnancy-related factors; delivery, labor, and birth outcomes; early infant feeding; individual personality factors; childhood and current environments; mental health and well-being; attachment; and infant temperament.

The current retrospective study sought to delve into the disclosure component in cases of ICSA. The sample comprised 52 cases of adolescents who arrived at a child advocacy center (CAC) following ICSA. Analysis of these cases was targeted to capture the multifaceted nature of disclosure using those perspectives that could be documented by the CAC staff-of the practitioners, the adolescents, and their parents. Beyond the descriptive results regarding the victims and the nature of the abuse, the case analyses illustrate the disclosure process as experienced by the various parties involved, highlighting the challenging nature of this aspect of the phenomenon. For the parents, the disclosure experience can perhaps be best epitomized by the expression that was heard repeatedly-Stop waking the dead-an expression that indicated their wish to bring the subject to a close. The difficulty in disclosing such incidents was also illustrated by the fact that 20 children in the current sample were reluctant to collaborate during the CAC process. In fact, according to these data, most of the incidents were revealed following a police investigation rather than by a disclosure initiated by the children themselves. Focusing on this specific aspect of ICSA-that is, disclosure-enables a new perspective on it and stresses the need to further study it in such cases. A better understanding of the disclosure experience as it pertains to the individuals involved in cases of ICSA may improve and help modify future prevention and intervention efforts in the field.",,,,,"DSILVA, BROOKE/HCI-4879-2022; Katz, Carmit/AAE-8895-2019","Glucklich, Talia/0000-0003-3503-9813",,,,,,,,,,,,,0886-2605,1552-6518,,,,MAY,2021,36,9-10,,,,,NP5084,NP5104,,10.1177/0886260518796526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260518796526,,,,,,,,30160592,,,,,WOS:000642595600069,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given MSM experience a heightened prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and meningococcal disease, we examined their preferences for bundling rapid HIV testing with an intervention to promote vaccination against these infections. In 2020, we conducted five virtual focus groups (N = 25 participants) in English and Spanish with MSM in Southern California's Inland Empire. Participants discussed their knowledge about HPV and meningitis vaccination and attitudes toward receiving vaccination information and referrals during rapid HIV tests. We used the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique to systematically analyse the data. Participants had a mean age of 30, were socioeconomically diverse, and predominantly (68%) Hispanic. 96% had ever been tested for HIV, while only 28% were vaccinated against HPV and/or meningitis. Most participants were unaware of MSM's elevated risk for HPV and meningitis and were eager to receive vaccination information from LGBTQ+-friendly providers. However, many participants emphasised rapid HIV testing was stressful and anticipated feeling overwhelmed if presented with vaccination information in this setting. Preferred formats for vaccine promotion included pamphlets and resources that could be discretely accessed online, supported by broader advertising featuring diverse MSM on social media, dating apps, and posters in the community. Overall, our findings suggest that bundling health promotion messages with rapid HIV testing may be ineffective, as the anxiety associated with taking an HIV test may interfere with such messages and their impact.",,,,,"Polonijo, Andrea N./JAN-4766-2023","Polonijo, Andrea N./0000-0003-4706-3482; Brown, Brandon/0000-0002-6348-4108",,,,,,,,,,,,,0966-0410,1365-2524,,,,2022 SEP,2022,30,5,,,,,E2580,E2589,,10.1111/hsc.13702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13702,,JAN 2022,,,,,,34985804,,,,,WOS:000738971500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, it is not clear how patients would conceptualize a patient portal and which health information needs they have when doing so. Objective: This study aimed (1) to investigate health information needs, expectations, and attitudes toward a patient portal and (2) to assess whether determinants, such as patient characteristics, health literacy, and empowerment status, can predict two different variables, namely the importance people attribute to obtaining health information when using a patient portal and the expectations concerning personal health care when using a patient portal. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Flemish population on what patients prefer to know about their digital health data and their expectations and attitudes toward using a patient portal to access their electronic health record. People were invited to participate in the survey through newsletters, social media, and magazines. We used a questionnaire including demographics, health characteristics, health literacy, patient empowerment, and patient portal characteristics. Results: We received 433 completed surveys. The health information needs included features such as being notified when one's health changes (371/396, 93.7%), being notified when physical parameters increase to dangerous levels (370/395, 93.7%), observing connections between one's symptoms or diseases or biological parameters (339/398, 85.2%), viewing the evolution of one's health in function of time (333/394, 84.5%), and viewing information about the expected effect of treatment (349/395, 88.4%). Almost 90% (369/412) of respondents were interested in using a patient portal. Determinants of patients' attachment for obtaining health information on a patient portal were (1) age between 45 and 54 years (P=.05); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested attitude (P=.008) toward shared decision making; and (3) commitment to question physicians' decisions (P=.03, R-2=0.122). Determinants of patients' expectations on improved health care by accessing a patient portal were (1) lower education level (P=.04); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested attitude (P=.008) toward shared decision making; and (3) problems in understanding health information (P=.04; R-2=0.106). Conclusions: The interest in using a patient portal is considerable in Flanders. People would like to receive alerts or some form of communication from a patient portal in case they need to act to manage their health.

Questionnaires were distributed at three major Free From events in the UK in 2017 and 2018. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used as a confirmatory technique to determine the model's validity. Cereals containing gluten, milk and eggs were the most common triggers reported by the consumers. Other trigger foods such as chocolate, garlic, maize, onions, red and white meat, spices, and fruits such as apples and cherries were also reported. Consumers demonstrated very good understanding on the severity of allergic reactions, prevention method and hidden egg ingredients. Overall, consumers were relatively good in the knowledge section. The participants were motivated in their personal allergen avoidance towards food allergens especially in checking food labels, preference for more free from product choices and handwashing. Consumers did not rely on dietary apps or social media to find out about allergen-free food products. Both knowledge and attitude did not translate into food allergy management practices. Significant correlation between knowledge and attitude was identified suggesting that as knowledge decreases, so will their attitude scores.

More than 90% of patients are cured with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone or a combination of them. This success depends on early and accurate disease diagnosis and the application of optimum treatment. Aim: to assess adults' awareness, attitude, and practice regarding testicular cancer (TC) and testicular self-examination (TSE) in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all adults in Aseer region. The study was conducted during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire which was developed by the researchers after intensive literature review and expert's consultation. Adults' awareness regarding testicular cancer (TC) was assessed covering its main domains including general definition, signs and symptoms, age of incidence, self-examination methods, and curability. The questionnaire was uploaded online, using social media platforms, by the researchers and their relatives and friends. All adults fulfilling the inclusion criteria who received the electronic questionnaire during the study period were invited to participate through filling out the questionnaire. Results: The survey included 809 male participants who completed the questionnaire. Participants ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old with mean age of 26.9 12.7 years. The majority of participants (73.1%; 591) were single while 23.7% were married. Exactly 591 (73.1%) participants had heard about cancer tests and 651 (80.5%) knew it affects men. Regarding age susceptible to testicular cancer, 218 (26.9%) of the participants reported 15-40 years old. About 5.1% of the participants agreed that routine self-examination for TC is not important, 194 (24%) reported it is important. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that male adult's awareness about TC and TSE are inadequate and the proportion who are performing it is below the average.

Estimates were calculated using (1) direct estimates from the CCHS, (2) Wisdom of the Crowds (WOTC), and (3) the multiplier method using data from a bio-behavioural MSM survey, clinic-based HIV testing, and online social media network site Facebook. Data sources requiring greater public disclosure of sexual orientation resulted in our mid-range population estimates (Facebook 23,760, CCHS 30,605). The WOTC method produced the lowest estimate, 10,000. The multiplier method using STI clinic HIV testing data produced the largest estimate, 41,777. The median of all estimates was 27,183, representing 2.9% of the Metro Vancouver census male adult population, with an interquartile range of 1.1-4.5%.

Due to its common and long-term use, it is associated with serious nasal complications. It is commonly self-administrated in many otolaryngology diseases like the common cold, sinusitis, and acute or chronic rhinitis. The long-term usage of nasal decongestants is associated with significantly increased side effects. AimTo assess the prevalence of the usage of nasal decongestants among the general population in Saudi Arabia ad the pattern of its use. MethodologyA questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was applied to level all available populations in Saudi Arabia. Participants with ages aged 10 to 60 years old in Saudi Arabia were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected from participants using a predesigned online questionnaire.

Purposeful recruitment will be conducted to include a sufficient number of men in the study. The Hands-Up program includes both exercise and education. Participants will engage in approximately 45 min of a full-body home exercise routine followed by 30 min of education in an online program. The educational modules will focus on fall prevention, nutrition for osteoporosis and learning about osteoporosis. Participants will engage in the program online, twice a week for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome of the study is feasibility. The study will be considered feasible if participants attend >60% of the sessions, 74 participants are enrolled in 12 months and >75% of participants attend the final study visit. For the secondary outcome, physical and self-report outcomes will be assessed. Ethics and discussion This study has been approved by the institutional ethics review board. The viability of an online exercise and education program for people after distal radius fracture between the ages of 50 and 65 will be evaluated in an attempt to help better prevent, diagnose and manage osteoporosis. This study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, international conferences and social media.",,,,,"Szekeres, Mike/AAD-6153-2022; Bryant, Dianne M/K-6766-2013; MacDermid, Joy Christine/H-7837-2013; Bryant, Dianne/ABD-4613-2021","Bryant, Dianne M/0000-0002-7535-8707; MacDermid, Joy Christine/0000-0001-9311-7379; Bryant, Dianne/0000-0002-7535-8707; Ziebart, Christina/0000-0002-3667-4133",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,,2021,11,7,,,,,,,e046122,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046122,,,,,,,,34330854,,,,,WOS:000691830900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is no study investigating the association between exercise and the HRQOL in UD patients. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of UD and its association with physical exercise, and its impact on HRQOL in Indonesian patients with UD. Methods This was a population-based, cross-sectional study, conducted using an internet-based questionnaire which was randomly distributed throughout Indonesia using the social media. The questionnaire contained socio-demographic details, exercise levels, Rome III criteria for dyspepsia, and SF-NDI (Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index). The frequency, duration, the intensity of exercise, and the classification of exercise according to ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) were included in the assessment. The screening for UD was conducted using the Rome III criteria and the SF-NDI score was calculated to assess the HRQOL in patients with UD. Results A total of 2725 valid responses were collected. The overall prevalence of UD in the study was 49.75%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that gender (female) and lack of exercise were independently associated with UD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.74-2.47, p < 0.001 and OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.42-2.07, p < 0.001).

This survey explored the impact of hypothyroidism on patient satisfaction, everyday living, experiences with health care professionals, and influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors.Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey targeting an international population of hypothyroid patients. Multilevel regression modeling was used for analyses.Results: The total number of responses was 3915 from 68 countries. Satisfaction with care and treatment was not associated with type of treatment for hypothyroidism. Having no confidence and trust in health care professionals was strongly associated with dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Controlling for all other variables, significant differences were found among satisfaction rates between countries. A weak inverse relationship was found between satisfaction with care and treatment and impact on everyday living (p < 0.001). Respondents taking levothyroxine (LT4) alone were more likely to report a positive impact on everyday living (pooled odds ratio 2.376 [confidence interval: 0.941-5.997]) than respondents taking liothyronine-containing treatments.Conclusions: Low levels of satisfaction with care and treatment for hypothyroidism were strongly associated with lack of confidence and trust and negative experiences with health care professionals. Differences in responses between countries were noted, implying the potential influence of national health care systems, socioeconomic and cultural factors. Contrary to widespread anecdotes in social media, this large-scale survey shows no association between type of treatment for hypothyroidism and patient satisfaction, as well as better outcomes on everyday living associated with LT4, compared with liothyronine-containing treatments.",,,,,"PERROS, Petros/AGH-1737-2022","PERROS, Petros/0000-0001-7320-5574",,,,,,,,,,,,,1050-7256,1557-9077,,,,2022 OCT,2022,32,10,,,,,1158,1168,,10.1089/thy.2022.0324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/thy.2022.0324,,SEP 2022,,,,,,35959734,,,,,WOS:000862864000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the 'omics era, twin cohorts have even greater research potential. This study describes the formation of the UK IBD Twin Registry and analysis of concordance and environmental factors. Method Twin pairs with IBD were recruited by advertising via IBD charities and social media, re-tracing a dormant IBD database and clinician referral. Details of zygosity, concordance, disease history and environmental factors were assessed. Pair concordance was calculated, and environmental factors were analysed with logistic regression models adjusted for zygosity and concordance. Results Ninety-one twin pairs were included in the analysis; forty-two with CD and forty-nine with UC. More MZ twin pairs with CD were concordant compared with DZ pairs, thus inferring heritability (Chi-sq. 15.6. P < 0.001). In UC, MZ concordance was also numerically greater. Cigarette smoking was predictive of CD (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.07 P = 0.02); there may be an independent association with cannabis smoking (OR 2.59 95% CI 0.89 to 7.55 P = 0.08). Breastfeeding was protective against UC (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.93, P = 0.03), but not CD. Self-reports of less occurrences of gastroenteritis than peers were protective against future UC onset (OR 0.33 95% CI 0.15 to 0.74, P = 0.01). Method of delivery, parental attitudes towards hygiene and recall of diet did not impact future IBD concordance. Conclusions This study supports the heritability of IBD.

The study was aimed at assessing the relationship between selected negative emotions, the quality of sleep, the level of perceived stress as well as stress coping strategies and suicidal ideation and attempts among high school students. The examined group consisted of adolescents aged 16-18 recruited by social-media groups in Poland. The study was based on a diagnostic survey with the application of CAWI method. The other research tools applied in the study included: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Modified, Perceived Stress Scale-10, How do you cope?-Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale as well as the authors' own questionnaire on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Anxiety, depression, aggression and insomnia as well as a high level of stress were statistically more common in girls than in boys (p < 0.001). The high level of negative emotions and insomnia, in turn, increased the risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 3.59, 95% CI: 2.13-6.06 and OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.60-3.46), as well as suicide attempts (OR = 6.29, 95% CI: 2.93-14.80 and OR = 3.29, 95% CI: 2.07-5.35). Additionally, high level of stress was associated with more than twice larger odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.13-4.63).

We aim to describe patient experiences related to receiving a PsA diagnosis.MethodsOurs was a mixed-method, 2-phase study. Phase 1 comprised concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with clinical experts and adults diagnosed with PsA to develop a cross sectional, web-based survey. US adults with a self-reported PsA diagnosis were recruited through a patient support community (CreakyJoints), an online patient research registry (ArthritisPower), and social media outreach. In Phase 2, the online survey collected data on sociodemographics, clinical symptoms, disease burden, and diagnosis history of survey respondents with PsA.ResultsOf the 203 respondents included, 172 (84.7%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 51.6 (10.8) years. The time between seeking medical attention and receiving a diagnosis was <6months for 69 respondents, 6months to 4years for 68 respondents, and5years for 66 respondents. Most respondents sought care from general practitioners (79.8%) and rheumatologists (66.5%). Common initial symptoms that led respondents to seek medical attention were joint pain (70.0%) and stiffness (53.7%). Among the initial symptoms that led respondents to seek care, joint pain, swollen joints, and sausage-like fingers or toes (indicating dactylitis) were more common among respondents with shorter time to diagnosis, whereas stiffness, fatigue, enthesitis (indicated by foot problems, tendon and ligament pain), and back pain were more common among respondents with longer time to diagnosis. Common misdiagnoses were psychosomatic issues (26.6%) and osteoarthritis (21.7%). Respondents with shorter times to diagnosis had lower frequencies of misdiagnosis.ConclusionsRespondents with PsA reported delays in diagnosis and misdiagnoses on their journey to a PsA diagnosis. Symptom differences, such as enthesitis and stiffness, were noted among respondents with shorter vs longer time to diagnosis.

Risk factors for CCLR include breed (especially large and giant breeds), body weight, gender and spay/neuter status, and age. Few studies have evaluated physical activity and fitness indicators, however, as risk factors for disease. This study used an online questionnaire distributed primarily via social media to assess risk factors for CCLR in dogs actively engaged in agility training or competition to determine demographic and physical activity factors associated with rupture. Results Data from 260 dogs with CCLR were compared to similar data from 1006 dogs without CCLR. All dogs were actively training or competing in agility at the time of CCLR or the time of data submission, respectively. Physical characteristics associated with increased risk of CCLR included younger age, spayed female sex, greater body weight, and greater weight to height ratio. Agility activities associated with increased odds ratios included competition in events sponsored by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC), competing at novice and intermediate levels, and competing in fewer than 10 events/year. Odds ratios were lower in dogs that competed in events sponsored by United Kingdom Agility International (UKI). Other activities associated with increased odds ratio for CCLR included involvement in flyball activities and short walks or runs over hilly or flat terrain on a weekly basis. Activities associated with decreased odds ratio included involvement in dock diving, barn hunt, nosework, or lure coursing/racing activities and participation in core balance and strength exercises at least weekly. Conclusions These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that body weight and spay/neuter status are risk factors for CCLR in dogs. This is the first report to demonstrate that risk of CCLR in agility dogs is decreased in dogs that engage in regular core strengthening exercises, compete more frequently, compete at higher levels, and compete in more athletically challenging venues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1746-6148,,,,JAN 15,2022,18,1,,,,,,,39,10.1186/s12917-022-03146-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-022-03146-2,,,,,,,,35033070,,,,,WOS:000742916200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present epidemiological study measured various aspects of sleep disturbance such as sleep quality, daytime impairments, negative emotionality, sleep hygiene, and well-being associated with CoVID-19 pandemic among the Indian population. Methods: This cross-sectional voluntary online survey (using Google form) was communicated across the country from 4th June to 3rd July 2020 through mail and social media applications. The responses received (N = 450) were categorized and validated using the latent class analysis and logistic regression tests respectively, and the classes and subclasses derived were profiled. These techniques are used for the first time in a CoVID-19 sleep study. Results: Out of the three classes derived from the LCA, people with severe dyssomnia belonging to class 1 (33.3%) showed high daytime impairments, negative emotionality and high vulnerability towards CoVID-19 pandemic measures. In addition, the two subclasses derived from the severe dyssomnia group; one with negative emotionality predominance and the other with excessive daytime sleepiness, were similarly affected by CoVID-19 measures. People with moderate dyssomnia (class 2, 28.5%) showed frequent arousals with daytime impairments and the majority (38.2%) which fell in to class 3, the 'no dyssomnia' category, were not impacted by CoVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: People with existing sleep problems or those who were vulnerable to the same were the ones affected by CoVID-19 pandemic. Those with inadequate emotional coping styles have showed heightened vulnerability. Proper medical and cognitive interventions are highly recommended for this population. No or moderate dyssomnia categories (class 3 and 2 respectively) were less impacted by CoVID-19. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, in this study, we analyzed trends, specifically related to recreational screen use, and associations with psychological well-being (PWB) in the years before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic, among a wide range of school-aged children, widely across the nation. Methods Using the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) years 2018-21, we analyzed a large random sample of school-aged children (6-17 years old) across the US (n = 88,823). We developed PWB issue scores (PWBIS) using self-reported measures relevant to this age group, and constructed regression models to assess the magnitude of the contribution of the pandemic on recreational screen use and PWB. Results The prevalence of recreational screen overuse and PWBIS increased significantly during the pandemic, compared to prior years. We also detected a notable effect of the pandemic on increased PWBIS, as well as its interaction term finding that it strengthened the association between screen time and PWBIS (p < 0.01 across all regression models). Conclusions Accordingly, our results demonstrate the importance of the pandemic itself as an independent adverse factor and effect measure modifier for screen overuse and PWB more generally among all school-age children widely across the US.

This study is a secondary data analysis from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015, a population-based study that was conducted nationwide in Malaysia using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. A total of 15,738 adults >= 18-years-old were recruited into the study, which reports the prevalence of hypertension stages among adults in Malaysia using the JNC7 criteria and determinants of its severity. The overall prevalence of raised blood pressure was 66.8%, with 45.8% having prehypertension, 15.1% having Stage 1 hypertension, and 5.9% having Stage 2 hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, a higher likelihood of having prehypertension was observed among respondents with advancing age, males (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.41-3.12), Malay ethnicity (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.44), lower socioeconomic status, and excessive weight. The factors associated with clinical hypertension (Stages 1 and 2) were older age, rural residency (Stage 1 OR = 1.22, Stage 2 OR = 1.28), Malay ethnicity (Stage 2 OR = 1.64), diabetes (Stage 2 OR = 1.47), hypercholesterolemia (Stage 1 OR = 1.34, Stage 2 OR = 1.82), being overweight (Stage 1 OR = 2.86, Stage 2 OR = 3.44), obesity (Stage 1 OR = 9.01, Stage 2 OR = 13.72), and lower socioeconomic status. Almost 70% of Malaysian adults are at a risk of elevated blood pressure. The highest prevalence was in the prehypertension group, which clearly predicts a future incurable burden of the disease.

A survey of parental home safety practices before and during the COVID-19 pandemic",INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: To slow the spread of COVID-19, many nonessential businesses, daycares, and schools closed, and areas imposed stay-at-home  orders. Closures led to young children spending more time at home, traditionally, the place where more than one-half of unintentional pediatric injuries occur. The objective of the current study was to describe parental safety perceptions and confidence, safety device purchase and installation, and injury prevention practices and behaviors, in homes with children 6 years of age and younger, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a convenience sample of US participants, 18 years or older, was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021. Parents of children (<= 6 years) were recruited via social media ads and posts on Facebook and Twitter and invited to complete an anonymous, online survey about their home safety practices before and during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Upon completion, parents could participate in a prize drawing to receive one of five $100 gift cards.Results: A total of 499 participants completed the survey. Most (47.9%) were 45-54 years of age and reported the amount of time at home increased for them (93.9%) and their children (90.6%) during the stay-at-home period. Thirty-seven percent (36.9%) of parents considered their homes safe but recognized room for improvement and felt confident in their ability to make their homes safe for their children (72.8%). From the time before until the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were in place, parents increased their home injury prevention practices (42.3%). Parents that had identified unsafe areas in the home before the stay-at-home order were significantly more likely to increase their safety behaviors, take childproofing actions, and purchase or install safety devices during the stay-at-home order (p < 0.0001). Parents with younger children (5 years) were significantly more likely than parents with older children to take childproofing actions (p < .0001) including purchasing and installing safety devices (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Spending more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic may have helped the sampled parents, especially those with younger children, identify unsafe areas in their homes and encourage them to modify their behaviors, and purchase and install safety devices to help make their homes safer for their children.",,,,,"McKenzie, Lara B/C-5122-2012","Roberts, Kristin J/0000-0001-6052-6731",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2197-1714,,,,DEC 21,2022,9,SUPPL 1,,1,SI,,,,43,10.1186/s40621-022-00396-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40621-022-00396-4,,,,,,,,36544172,,,,,WOS:000902001300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, early diagnosis and its management is essential in any educational setting. Objectives: To identify university students with social phobia, to find out its determinants and to observe its impact on their quality of life. Methods: The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Social Phobia Inventory Questionnaire and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire were used. Results: The mean age of the 450 student participants was 20.6 +/- 1.6 years. Majority [312(69.3%)] were males and majority [305(67.8%)] were native of urban areas. Of the total, 169(37.6%) were found to have social phobia. Among them, 114(67.5%) had mild, 47(27.8%) had moderate and 8(4.7%) had severe social phobia. Family history of anxiety disorders (P=0.006), embarrassment with own socio-economic status (P=0.001) and past history of failure in academic examinations (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the presence of social phobia among the participants. Preference of interaction using social media instead of face to face communication with people (P=0.013), and by texting rather than calling the person (P=0.002) were seen significantly more among those with social phobia. The mean quality of life scores was found to be deteriorating significantly with increasing intensity of social phobia among students (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Social phobia was seen among more than one-third of the participants. Counselling centers are therefore required to address this problem at universities.

Severity and sporting impact were defined by VISA-P and availability, respectively.Results: A model comprising seven factors distinguished PT from other knee problems; training duration (OR = 1.10), sport type (OR = 2.31), injured side (OR = 2.28), pain onset (OR = 1.97), morning pain (OR = 1.89), condition acceptability (OR = 0.39) and swelling (OR = 0.37). Sports-specific function (OR = 1.02) and player level (OR = 4.11) explained sporting availability. 44% of PT severity variance was explained by quality of life (0 = 0.32), sports-specific function (0 = 0.38) and age (0 =-0.17).Conclusion: Sports-specific, biomedical and psychological factors partially distinguish PT from other knee problems. Availability is mainly explained by sports-specific factors, while psychosocial factors impact on severity. Adding sports-specific and bio-psycho-social factors into assessments could help better iden-tification and management of jumping athletes with PT.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: To determine the feasibility of the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) trial - a RCT comparing restricted fluid bolus (10 ml/kg) with current practice (20 ml/kg) in children with septic shock in the UK. Design: (1) Qualitative feasibility study exploring parents' views about the pilot RCT. (2) Pilot RCT over a 9-month period, including integrated parental and staff perspectives study. Setting: (1) Recruitment took place across four NHS hospitals in England and on social media. (2) Recruitment took place across 13 NHS hospitals in England. Participants: (1) Parents of children admitted to a UK hospital with presumed septic shock in the previous 3 years. (2) Children presenting to an emergency department with clinical suspicion of infection and shock after 20 ml/kg of fluid. Exclusion criteria were receipt of > 20 ml/kg of fluid, conditions requiring fluid restriction and the patient not for full active treatment (i.e. palliative care plan in place). Site staff and parents of children in the pilot were recruited to the perspectives study. Interventions: (1) None. (2) Children were randomly allocated (1 : 1) to 10-or 20-ml/kg fluid boluses every 15 minutes for 4 hours if in shock. Main outcome measures: (1) Acceptability of FiSh trial, proposed consent model and potential outcome measures. (2) Outcomes were based on progression criteria, including recruitment and retention rates, protocol adherence and separation between the groups, and collection and distribution of potential outcome measures. Results: (1) Twenty-one parents were interviewed. All would have consented for the pilot study. (2) Seventy-five children were randomised, 40 to the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and 35 to the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group. Two children were withdrawn. Although the anticipated recruitment rate was achieved, there was variability across the sites. Fifty-nine per cent of children in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and 74% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group required only a single trial bolus before shock resolved. The volume of fluid (in ml/kg) was 35% lower in the first hour and 44% lower over the 4-hour period in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group. Fluid boluses were delivered per protocol (volume and timing) for 79% of participants in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and for 55% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group, mainly as a result of delivery not being completed within 15 minutes. There were no deaths. Length of hospital stay, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfers, and days alive and PICU free did not differ significantly between the groups. Two adverse events were reported in each group. A questionnaire was completed by 45 parents, 20 families and seven staff were interviewed and 20 staff participated in focus groups. Although a minority of site staff lacked equipoise in favour of more restricted boluses, all supported the trial. Conclusions: Even though a successful feasibility and pilot RCT were conducted, participants were not as unwell as expected. A larger trial is not feasible in its current design in the UK.

It is common in older people in the emergency department (ED) and acute hospital, but greatly under-recognised in these and other settings. Delirium and other forms of cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, commonly coexist. There is a need for a rapid delirium screening tool that can be administered by a range of professional-level healthcare staff to patients with sensory or functional impairments in a busy clinical environment, which also incorporates general cognitive assessment. We developed the 4 'A's Test (4AT) for this purpose. This study's primary objective is to validate the 4AT against a reference standard. Secondary objectives include (1) comparing the 4AT with another widely used test (the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)); (2) determining if the 4AT is sensitive to general cognitive impairment; (3) assessing if 4AT scores predict outcomes, including (4) a health economic analysis. Methods and analysis 900 patients aged 70 or over in EDs or acute general medical wards will be recruited in three sites (Edinburgh, Bradford and Sheffield) over 18 months. Each patient will undergo a reference standard delirium assessment and will be randomised to assessment with either the 4AT or the CAM. At 12 weeks, outcomes (length of stay, institutionalisation and mortality) and resource utilisation will be collected by a questionnaire and via the electronic patient record. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted in Scotland and England. The study involves administering tests commonly used in clinical practice. The main ethical issues are the essential recruitment of people without capacity.

Health Care Workers (HCWs) with sound knowledge and practices can help curb the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of HCWs about COVID-19 and compare physicians and non-physicians in Saudi Arabia. Methods: An online survey was conducted among HCWs in Saudi Arabia in March and April 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire having four sections including; socio-demographic and professional profile, knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. Questionnaire link was sent through social media. Descriptive analysis was used for assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice and Chi-square test was used for comparing physicians and non-physicians. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Results: A total of 398 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Only 45% of the participants had correct knowledge about the agent while about 97% knew that close contact with infected person is the most important risk factor. Only 63% had correct knowledge about the role of antibiotics in COVID-19 treatment. Majority of the HCWs were worried and most frequently reported worry was risk to family. Carrying infection to home was most commonly reported fear, 92%. Cleaning hands often or always was 11.5% and 87% respectively. About 71% wore mask during work. Knowledge was better among physicians compared to non-physicians while attitude and practices were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion: We found that there was poor knowledge about causative agent and role of antibiotics for COVID-19 but for mode of transmission and prevention there was good knowledge. There were widely prevalent worries and fears among the participants. Overall, there were good infection control practices among the HCWs. Interventions are needed to improve knowledge and address worries and fears of HCW. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Its adverse consequences may persist throughout the life course, exerting a potentially heavy burden on families, health systems, and societies. In high-income countries, the first children who benefited from improved care are now adults entering middle age. However, there is a clear gap in the knowledge regarding the long-term outcomes of individuals born preterm. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting and following up an e-cohort of adults born preterm worldwide and provide estimations of participation, characteristics of participants, the acceptability of questions, and the quality of data collected. Methods: We implemented a prospective, open, observational, and international e-cohort pilot study (Health of Adult People Born Preterm-an e-Cohort Pilot Study [HAPP-e]). Inclusion criteria were being an adult (aged =18 years), born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), having internet access and an email address, and understanding at least 1 of the available languages. A large, multifaceted, and multilingual communication strategy was established. Between December 2019 and June 2021, inclusion and repeated data collection were performed using a secured web platform. We provided descriptive statistics regarding participation in the e-cohort, namely, the number of persons who registered on the platform, signed the consent form, initiated and completed the baseline questionnaire, and initiated and completed the follow-up questionnaire. We also described the main characteristics of the HAPP-e participants and provided an assessment of the quality of the data and the acceptability of sensitive questions. Results: As of December 31, 2020, a total of 1004 persons had registered on the platform, leading to 527 accounts with a confirmed email and 333 signed consent forms. A total of 333 participants initiated the baseline questionnaire. All participants were invited to follow-up, and 35.7% (119/333) consented to participate, of whom 97.5% (116/119) initiated the follow-up questionnaire. Completion rates were very high both at baseline (296/333, 88.9%) and at follow-up (112/116, 96.6%). This sample of adults born preterm in 34 countries covered a wide range of sociodemographic and health characteristics. The gestational age at birth ranged from 23+6 to 36+6 weeks (median 32, IQR 29-35 weeks). Only 2.1% (7/333) of the participants had previously participated in a cohort of individuals born preterm. Women (252/333, 75.7%) and highly educated participants (235/327, 71.9%) were also overrepresented. Good quality data were collected thanks to validation controls implemented on the web platform. The acceptability of potentially sensitive questions was excellent, as very few participants chose the I prefer not to say option when available.

Patients and methods: The work included 513 medical students from Kafrelsheikh University. The 2010 and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) fibromyalgia classification criteria were used to determine the presence of FMS. The chronic pain grade questionnaire was used to assess pain severity and impact on daily activities, recreational, social and family activities, and ability to work. Results: The students were 296 females (57.7 %) and 217 males (42.3 %). 64 (12.5 %) fulfilled the 2010 criteria (F:M 2.8:1) (p = 0.015). The frequency of female affection was 15.9 % (47/296) compared to 7.83 % (17/217) in male. 37 (7.2 %) fulfilled 2016 criteria and only six cases (9.3 %) were known to have FMS. The frequency of FMS in students of the first 3 years (basic science) and the following 3 years (clinical) was 14.1 % and 9.5 %, respectively. Considering the chronic pain grade, there was a significant difference (p < 0.0001) in all pain items, daily recreational, social, family activities, and ability to work between those with and without FMS. 213 (41.5 %) had knowledge about FMS and the source of their information was from social media (39.4 %), their academic study (26.8 %), web pages (25.4 %) and friends (8.5 %). Conclusion: Fibromyalgia is highly frequent among medical students, especially females of basic years with a high impact on recreational, social, family activities, and ability to work.

Not achieving the goal of treatments because of non-adherence will lead to more complications and eventually may lead to death. In Saudi Arabia, we have insufficient data for interpretation. Hence, this study aims to have a better perspective at the number of the non-adherent patients with chronic diseases to their medications and its associated factors. Material and Method Cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among chronic diseases patients living in Saudi Arabia throughout social media and hospital visits from August 2018 to April 2019. A three-section questionnaire consists of patient's health, medications and adherence characteristics. Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS) was used to identify the level of adherence among chronic diseases patients. Univariate descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test with one-way ANOVA were used as bivariate analysis. Finally, significant predictors of medical adherence with adjusted coefficient were determined by multivariable linear regression. Results A total of 385 patients were included in the analysis for the current study. Overall, 96.62% (n = 372) were non-adherent to their medications according to ARMS scale. Multiple linear regression model found types of co-morbidities, medication dosage form and dosage regimen to be independent predictors of medical adherence. Conclusion Medication adherence is alarmingly low among chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. There is a clear need for in-depth understanding for barriers. It is therefore important to conduct a qualitative study. What's newWhat's known Medication adherence is a critical factor in treatment success. Low adherence to the medication is a common problem among chronic disease patients. Moreover, the majority of the studies in Saudi Arabia showed low adherence rate, and it focused in one single chronic disease only despite that patient may have more. Most patients had more than one single chronic disease, so this study aims to take a snapshot to capture the adherence rate among patients who are suffering from chronic disease Saudi Arabia and its associated factors. This can help in understanding medication adherence behavior in clinical practice.",,,,,"Kurdi, Sawsan/AAX-9591-2021; Islam, Md. Ashraful/B-8887-2015","Kurdi, Sawsan/0000-0003-0644-6110; Islam, Md.

However, there is sparse research performed on climbers, constituting a knowledge gap which the present study aims to fill. The primary outcomes of the study are to examine disordered eating and overuse injuries in rock climbers. Secondary variables are body image, indicators of relative energy deficiency, mental health problems, compulsive training, perfectionism, sleep quality and bone density.Method and analysis This prospective longitudinal study aims to recruit Swedish competitive rock climbers (>13 years) via the Swedish Climbing Federation. A non-athlete control group will be recruited via social media (n=equal of the climbing group). Data will be collected using streamlined validated web-based questionnaires with three follow-ups over 2 years. Inclusion criteria for rock climbers will be a minimum advanced level according to International Rock-Climbing Research Association. The non-athlete control group is matched for age and gender. Exclusion criteria are having competed at an elite level in any sport as well as training more often than twice per week. Statistical analyses will include multinominal logistic regression, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). We will assess effect measure modification when relevant and conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of lost to follow-up.Ethics and dissemination The Rock-Climbers' Longitudinal attitudes towards Injuries, Mental health and Body image study, CLIMB, was approved by the Swedish ethics authority (2021-05557-01).

When abnormal tissues or a malignant mass is found early, treatment and cure rates are improved. In late stages, the cancer may have grown and metastasized. This can negatively affect cancer treatment and reduce the overall survival rate. Screening tests are performed when a person is asymptomatic. Public awareness about cancer screening is crucial for the success of cancer screening programs and for consequently decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate due to cancer. (2) Aim: Assess the knowledge and perception of the community regarding cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. (3) Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study targeting the general population of Saudi Arabia was conducted from January to June 2022. The data were collected using a structured validated electronic questionnaire. The study questionnaire covered participants' personal data, medical history, source of data, and participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice items. The questionnaire was used as a digital survey and was distributed electronically to the target population. (4) Results: A total of 1313 participants completed the study questionnaire. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 67 years, with a mean age of 28.3 +/- 11.4 years old. Overall, 60.4% of the study participants knew about cancer screening. Regarding the benefits of cancer screening, 91.8% of the participants reported knowing that the early detection of cancer helps treatment, and 81.1% knew that the early detection of cancer improves treatment outcomes. Moreover, 441 (33.6%) of the participants had good knowledge regarding cancer and cancer screening, while 872 (66.4%) had poor levels of knowledge. Furthermore, 106 (8.1%) of the participants underwent cancer screening. (5) Conclusions: The study results revealed that participants' awareness regarding cancer and cancer screening was low, especially for approaches to reduce cancer risk. Additionally, the study participants' practice regarding cancer screening was low. The health care authority should plan for population-based efficacious cancer screening programs. In addition, cancer screening information and the benefits of early detection can be disseminated through social media to target the desired populations.",,,,,"Elmaghraby, Dalia/IAR-1153-2023","Elmaghraby, Dalia/0000-0003-1137-5783",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,JAN,2023,20,2,,,,,,,1114,10.3390/ijerph20021114,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021114,,,,,,,,36673870,,,,,WOS:000915146900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

MUNCO is an international database used to collect clinical data on cases of CAM in real time. Preliminary data from the Mycotic Infections in COVID-19 (MUNCO) online registry yielded 728 cases from May to September 2021 in four South Asian countries and the United States. A majority of the cases (694; 97.6%) consisted of a mucormycosis infection. The dataset allowed for the analysis of the risk factors for adverse outcomes from CAM and this analysis is presented in this paper. Methods: The submission of cases was aided by a direct solicitation and social media online. The primary endpoints were full recovery or death measured on day 42 of the diagnosis. All patients had histopathologically confirmed CAM. The groups were compared to determine the contribution of each patient characteristic to the outcome. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to model the probability of death after a CAM diagnosis. Results: The registry captured 694 cases of CAM. Within this, 341 could be analyzed as the study excluded patients with an unknown CAM recovery status due to either an interruption or a lack of follow up. The 341 viable cases consisted of 258 patients who survived after the completion of treatment and 83 patients who died during the period of observation. In a multivariable logistic regression model, the factors associated with an increased risk of mortality include old age (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, p = 0.001), history of diabetes mellitus (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.01-11.9, p = 0.02) and a lower BMI (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, p = 0.03). Mucor localized to sinus disease was associated with 77% reduced odds of death (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.57, p = 0.001), while cerebral mucor was associated with an increased odds of death (OR = 10.96, 95% CI 4.93-24.36, p = <= 0.0001). Conclusion: In patients with CAM, older age, a history of diabetes and a lower body mass index is associated with increased mortality. Disease limited to the sinuses without a cerebral extension is associated with a lower risk of mortality. Interestingly, the use of zinc and azithromycin were not associated with increased mortality in our study.",,,,,"Narayanan, Shivakumar/AGO-6664-2022; Sarkar, Nirmal Kanti/ABA-2301-2020","Narayanan, Shivakumar/0000-0003-3440-0259; Sarkar, Nirmal Kanti/0000-0002-0986-0731; RAWAT, SUMIT KUMAR/0000-0002-8222-5486; Arora, Shitij/0000-0002-8927-6171",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2077-0383,,,,DEC,2022,11,23,,,,,,,7015,10.3390/jcm11237015,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm11237015,,,,,,,,36498589,,,,,WOS:000905065900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current situation outlined a specific reformulation of dental education in Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria - initial transition of face-to-face classes towards electronic learning (e-learning) processes, and subsequently, a transition from online teaching toward hybrid education. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate preclinical dental students' knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 precautions as well as crossinfection control strategies. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted online on 258 out of 516 preclinical dental students at the School of Dental Medicine, Sofia, using a self-administered questionnaire. Survey items were grouped in 3 general sections: educational experiences, students' knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 precautions and sources of relevant information as well as students' personal experiences during the current pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 169 students participated in the study (response rate: 65.5%). Of them, 98 (57.9%) were secondyear students, 42.6% were men, and their mean age was 21 +/- 1 years. Almost one-third of the participants indicated violation of disinfection and sterilization protocols (28.9%) and the presence of aerosol-generating procedures (27.2%) as the most important COVID-19 predisposing factors in dental practice. Vaccination was suggested as the most effective way of prevention against the COVID-19. Proposed infection control practices included strict cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization (87.6%), personal protective equipment (PPE) (85.8%), frequent ventilation (53.3%), and treatment after a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (or other) test (46.2%). Social media was considered as the main source for pandemic-related information (68.0%). CONCLUSION: In the light of COVID-19, dental students demonstrated a satisfactory level of knowledge regarding standard precautions in dental practice; however, more attention should be paid to additional transmission-based precautions to ensure the safety of educational and working environment.",,,,,"Avramova, Nadya/AAB-7000-2022","Avramova, Nadya/0000-0002-9830-9166",,,,,,,,,,,,,2322-1372,,,,,SUM,2021,10,,,,SI,,,,,10.22122/johoe.SpecialIssueofCOVID-19.1312,http://dx.doi.org/10.22122/johoe.SpecialIssueofCOVID-19.1312,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000705958200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current therapies (eg, steroids and biologics) are associated with mild to severe side effects, and none provide a cure. Recent research has focused on genetically engineering gut-specific anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells (CAR-Tregs) to control intestinal inflammation, a logistically and conceptually complex approach. The purpose of our study was to understand patients' willingness to try CAR-Treg given 2 hypothetical scenarios-in a clinical trial or as a new treatment. Methods: We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about their willingness to try CAR-Treg. The online survey was developed using patient focus groups and associated literature. We recruited participants through email and social media. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze closed-ended questions and inductive thematic analysis to analyze open-ended follow-up questions. Results: Survey participants indicated high willingness to try CAR-Treg therapy in both a clinical trial and as a new treatment. Willingness to try was not correlated with disease state or medication history. Women were less likely than men to indicate willingness to participate in a clinical trial. Participants' reasons for being willing to try CAR-Treg therapy included the wish to change their current treatment and the calling to participate in research. Participants that were not willing to try CAR-Treg mentioned the lack of long-term data and the success of their current therapy. Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to investigate patient willingness to try CAR-Treg therapy. Our results demonstrate the promise of moving this therapy into clinical practice as most patients indicated willingness to try. Lay Summary We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about their willingness to try a new therapeutic approach currently developed in several research laboratories-chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T-regulatory cells-and found high willingness to try, independent of disease state or medication history.",,,,,,"Steiner, Ted/0000-0002-3136-6668; Vent-Schmidt, Jens/0000-0001-7633-9279",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2631-827X,,,,OCT,2020,2,4,,,,,,,otaa085,10.1093/crocol/otaa085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/crocol/otaa085,,,,,,,,36777762,,,,,WOS:000755710700022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although knowledge regarding diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically, secondary prevention remains insufficiently implemented due to failure among affected individuals to adhere to guideline recommendations. This has continued to lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Involving patients in their healthcare and facilitating their active roles in their chronic disease management is an opportunity to meet the needs of the increasing number of cardiovascular patients. However, simple recall of advice regarding a more preventive lifestyle does not affect sustainable behavioral lifestyle changes. We investigate the effect of plaque visualization combined with low-threshold daily lifestyle tasks using the smartphone app PreventiPlaque to evaluate change in cardiovascular risk profile.Methods: and study design: This randomized, controlled clinical trial includes 240 participants with ultrasound evidence of atherosclerotic plaque in one or both carotid arteries, defined as focal thickening of the vessel wall measuring 50% more than the regular vessel wall. A criterion for participation is access to a smartphone suitable for app usage. The participants are randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. While both groups receive the standard of care, the intervention group has additional access to the PreventiPlaque app during the 12-month follow-up. The app includes daily tasks that promote a healthier lifestyle in the areas of smoking cessation, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet. The impact of plaque visualization and app use on the change in cardiovascular risk profile is assessed by SCORE2. Feasibility and effectiveness of the PreventiPlaque app are evaluated using standardized and validated measures for patient feedback. Ethics and dissemination: This clinical trial is approved by the ethics committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany). Study results will be disseminated at conferences and in peer -reviewed journals.

Health care worker worldwide are at higher risk worldwide and the situation is the same in Nepal. The knowledge and attitude of health workers will certainly mark the outcome towards this pandemic. So, this study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of community health workers towards the prevention of COVID-19 virus.MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among the community health workers of various provinces of Nepal. A semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire was prepared in Google form and circulated to the sampled health workers through various social media platforms like face book, messenger, Instagram and g-mails. A total of 650 invitations were send and among them 420 responded and among them only 399 provided complete response. Responses containing anonymized data was collected analyzed in using SPSS-version-20. The results were interpreted and was checked with various demographic and enabling factors using chi-square test and logistic regression model. Also, ethical approval was taken from NHRC (Nepal Health Research Council (protocol registration number: 360/2020P) prior to the conduction of study.ResultsOut the total sample size of 450, we took 399 responses taking into consideration all the inclusion criteria. So, from 399 valid response, 230 (47.6%) were males and 169 (42.4%) were females. 380 (95.2%) employed participants thought that wearing PPE will reduce the chances of getting COVID-19, majority of the participants 80.5% (321) responded that COVID-19 will successfully be controlled and staffs receiving excellent support from palika had high knowledge level. Knowledge level was significantly associated with the enabling factor support from palika (P =0.045).45.9% of the respondents had no availability of COVID-19 response medical items for prevention of COVID-19 at their respective health facilities. Also the logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of knowledge level was 2 times higher (AOR=1.913 at 95% CI: 1.266-2.891) compared to the female participants (Ref- female).ConclusionsProper and adequate knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 is a paramount in the prevention and control of SARS-COV-2.

Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help. Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness, perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near future. Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The sample was recruited in the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal explanations for the present problem, depression literacy, self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression), and whether respondents had previously sought mental healthcare. Results. Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder (n = 181, 87.4%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0%) according to the ICD-10. N = 94 (45.4%) participants had never received mental health treatment previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour. Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need for professional help. Conclusions. While several causal explanations are associated with self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for mental disorders.",,,,,"Schmidt-Schuchert, Silke/AGE-9391-2022; Evans, Sara/HNJ-3360-2023; Schomerus, Georg/A-6568-2013","Schmidt-Schuchert, Silke/0000-0002-4194-1937; Evans, Sara/0000-0003-4691-2630; Schomerus, Georg/0000-0002-6752-463X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7960,2045-7979,,,,AUG,2019,28,4,,,,,446,457,,10.1017/S2045796017000828,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S2045796017000828,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000512676300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most men with testicular cancer present with a lump. Testicular symptoms are more likely to occur secondary to benign diseases like epididymo-orchitis, a common sexually transmitted infection. Gender and sexual minorities are at an increased risk of testicular diseases and health disparities. The aim of this study was to co-design an inclusive community-based campaign to promote testicular awareness.Methods: This study uses the World Cafe methodology. Participation was sought from Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ friendly organisations, testicular cancer survivors, health policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic designers. Participants engaged in three rounds of conversations to co-design the campaign. Data were collected using drawing sheets, artefact cards, sticky notes, coloured markers and a voice recorder. Deductive thematic analysis was conducted.Results: Seventeen individuals participated in the study. Six themes emerged from the analysis as follows: (i) online communication; (ii) offline communication; (iii) behavioural targeting and education; (iv) campaign frequency and reach; (v) demographic segmentation; and (vi) campaign identity. The use of social media for campaign delivery featured strongly in all conversations. Participants also recommended offline communication using posters and radio/television advertisements to scale up the campaign and achieve wider reach. Advertisements to overcome embarrassment surrounding testicular health were particularly recommended. Participants emphasised that campaign delivery must be dynamic whilst ensuring that the health-promoting messages are not diluted or lost. They stressed the importance of being inclusive and tailoring the campaign to different age groups, gender identities and sexual orientations.Conclusions: Study recommendations will be used to design and deliver the campaign. Future research will be needed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, cost and effect of the campaign on promoting testicular awareness and early detection of testicular diseases.Patient or Public Contribution: A participatory research approach was used to co-design the campaign with members of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ (LGBTQ+) friendly organisations, LGBTQ+ student bodies, LGBTQ+ staff networks, LGBTQ+ sports clubs, men's health organisations, testicular cancer survivors, health policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic designers.",,,,,"Shorter, Gillian W/H-1929-2015; Murphy, David/A-4900-2019; McCarthy, Megan/JWP-8365-2024","Shorter, Gillian W/0000-0001-5752-2297; Murphy, David/0000-0002-9685-8292; McCarthy, Megan/0000-0002-1415-8461; Robertson, Steve/0000-0002-5683-363X; Flynn, Angela/0000-0003-0192-3141",,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-6513,1369-7625,,,,2024 FEB,2024,27,1,,,,,,,,10.1111/hex.13898,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.13898,,OCT 2023,,,,,,37877701,,,,,WOS:001091183200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been difficult to collect a large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies of this symptom have been conducted. To provide adequate support for online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system (PSS). Objective: This study aimed to analyze the behavior patterns of emotional eaters as the first step to designing a personalized intervention system. Methods: The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze behavioral data on EE. Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit, were analyzed. This dataset included all posts and feedback from July 2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. In addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated. Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of 90.64% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users with EE behaviors. The expert group that labeled the dataset to train the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. The experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0). Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA. Results: The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic: addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. The 5 main topics of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation, automatic bot feedback, and health information. The feedback topic distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior (overall P<.001). Conclusions: This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors. We discovered the possibility of the LDA topic model as an exploratory user study method for abnormal behaviors in medical research. We also investigated the possibilities of ML- and topic modeling-based classifiers to automatically categorize text-based behavioral data, which could be applied to personalized medicine in future research.",,,,,"Choi, Hyung Jin/AAU-9629-2020","Kim, Hyung Jun/0000-0002-0229-8803; Choi, Hyung Jin/0000-0003-0593-6978",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAR 31,2020,22,3,,,,,,,e15700,10.2196/15700,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/15700,,,,,,,,32229461,,,,,WOS:000522522900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative validity and reproducibility of a 30-minute and 44-item FFeQ in a sample of adults obtained from the general population. Methods: A sample of French adults was recruited through social media and an advertising campaign. A total of 223 volunteers completed the FFeQ twice at one-year intervals and were included in the reproducibility study. During that interval, 92 participants completed three-to-six 24-hour recalls and were included in the validity study. Nutrient and dietary intakes were computed for all validity and reproducibility participants. The level of agreement between the two methods was evaluated for nutrient and food group intakes using classification into quintiles of daily intake, correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Results: For relative validity, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.09 to 0.88 (unadjusted correlation coefficients, median: 0.48) and 0.02 to 0.68 (deattenuated and energy adjusted correlation coefficients, median: 0.50) for food group and nutrient intakes, respectively. The median proportion of subjects classified into the same or adjacent quintile was 73% and 66% for food and nutrient intakes, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement across the range of intakes. Regarding reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.33 to 0.72 (median: 0.60) and 0.55 to 0.73 (median: 0.64), for food and nutrient intakes, respectively. Conclusions: The FFeQ showed acceptable validity and reproducibility in a sample of adults based on their food and nutrient intakes.

It is experienced when the shape of the eye keeps light from focusing correctly on the retina. Refractive error proves to be a significant health issue as it is the most common cause of visual deterioration and the second leading cause of vision-loss internationally. There are many treatment modalities with public different preferences. Aim: to assess the awareness and attitude of the population with refractive error toward refractive correction methods particularly surgical procedures in Aseer region, Southern of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study targeting general population who lives in Asser region with refractive error. Data were collected using pre-structured electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire was used as a digital survey and distributed to all participants in a private and anonymous manner. Question was designed to elicit information in concise and objective manner. In addition, logics were used in the question so the subsequent answer would base on prior response. Final questionnaire was uploaded online using social media platforms. Results: A total of 402 participants with refractive errors completed the study questionnaire. Participants' ages ranged from 16 to 70 years with mean age of 30.1 +/- 12.9 years old. The most reported refractive error type was myopia (61.9%) followed by astigmatism (23.6%), and hyperopia (14.4%). The most reported refractive error corrective method was spectacles (72.4%), followed by refractive surgery (16.2%), spectacles with lenses (9.2%), and only lenses (2.2%). Exact of 239 (59.5%) of the study participants were aware of the surgical procedure for refractive error correction while a total of 118 (29.4%) of the study participants expect refractive surgeries to be dangerous. Conclusions: In conclusion, the current study revealed that myopia was the most reported refractive error and spectacles was the most used corrective method followed by surgery. Cosmetic issue with complications (eye infections) were the main factors behind refusing non-surgical modalities. Also, participants showed considerable awareness regarding surgical procedure and the attitude towards surgical approaches was not bad where vast majority think it is not dangerous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1012-8298,,,,,SEP,2022,44,3,,,,,1000,1004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000879575300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the rise of social media, it is seen that Twitter users are seeking Web-based connections for depression. Objective: This study aimed to identify communities where Twitter users tweeted using the hashtag #MyDepressionLooksLike to connect about depression. Once identified, we wanted to understand which community characteristics correlated to Twitter users turning to a Web-based community to connect about depression. Methods: Tweets were collected using NCapture software from May 25 to June 1, 2016 during the Mental Health Month (n=104) in the northeastern United States and Washington DC. After mapping tweets, we used a Poisson multilevel regression model to predict tweets per community (county) offset by the population and adjusted for percent female, percent population aged 15-44 years, percent white, percent below poverty, and percent single-person households. We then compared predicted versus observed counts and calculated tweeting index values (TIVs) to represent undertweeting and overtweeting. Last, we examined trends in community characteristics by TIV using Pearson correlation. Results: We found significant associations between tweet counts and area-level proportions of females, single-person households, and population aged 15-44 years. TIVs were lower than expected (TIV 1) in eastern, seaboard areas of the study region. There were communities tweeting as expected in the western, inland areas (TIV 2). Counties tweeting more than expected were generally scattered throughout the study region with a small cluster at the base of Maine. When examining community characteristics and overtweeting and undertweeting by county, we observed a clear upward gradient in several types of nonprofits and TIV values. However, we also observed U-shaped relationships for many community factors, suggesting that the same characteristics were correlated with both overtweeting and undertweeting. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Web-based communities, rather than replacing physical connection, may complement or serve as proxies for offline social communities, as seen through the consistent correlations between higher levels of tweeting and abundant nonprofits. Future research could expand the spatiotemporal scope to confirm these findings.",,,,,"DeJohn, Amber/AAX-2020-2020","Lachmar, E.

Handling Web Bias (HWB) is a new workshop focusing on best practices for identifying and handling web bias. Awareness of the problems of algorithmic and data bias has been growing but even with careful review of the algorithms and data sets, it may not be possible to delete all unwanted bias, particularly when systems learn from historical data that encodes cultural biases. This workshop will take a rich and cross-domain approach to this complicated problem, providing a venue for researchers to move beyond awareness of the problem of algorithmic and data bias to focus on practical strategies for handling it. HWB'19 is a three-quarter-day workshop including two keynotes and a session of discussion papers. The first keynote is from Alan Mislove, professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. He will speak about Measuring bias in social network ad targeting and delivery. The second keynote is from Jean Garcia-Gathright, a research scientist at Spotify. She will speak about Fair machine learning in industry: from research to practice. We also have a session highlight two discussion papers. First, Nina Cesare and Elaine Nsoesie from the Department of Global Health at Boston University along with Christian Grant from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma will present their work Understanding Demographic Bias and Representation in Social Media Health Data. Second, Taha Hassan from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech will present his work On Bias in Social Reviews of University Courses. In recent years, a collection of workshops and conferences have been founded to explore issues of fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics as they intersect with research in a diverse set of technical areas (e.g., FAT-ML to explore issues of fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning, FAT-IR to explore these issues in information retrieval and others). Many of these emerging venues have been highly multi-disciplinary bringing together researchers from computing, law, policy, ethics, anthropology and art. Given the fundamentally multi-disciplinary nature of the Web Science conference, we hope the Handling Web Bias workshop will provide a vibrant venue to discuss these important issues within the Web Science community.

This is, in part, due to the challenges of the acceptability of common trial designs to therapists and service users. This study investigated the acceptability of participation in cluster randomised controlled trials to therapists and service users. Methods A national electronic survey of UK occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, service managers, and parents of children who use their services. Participants were recruited by NHS Trusts sharing a link to an online questionnaire with children's therapists in their Trust and with parents via Trust social media channels. National professional and parent networks also recruited to the survey. We aimed for a sample size of 325 therapists, 30 service managers, and 60 parents. Trial participation was operationalised as three behaviours undertaken by both therapists and parents: agreeing to take part in a trial, discussing a trial, and sharing information with a research team. Acceptability of the behaviours was measured using an online questionnaire based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability constructs: affective attitude, self-efficacy, and burden. The general acceptability of trials was measured using the acceptability constructs of intervention coherence and perceived effectiveness. Data were collected from June to September 2020. Numerical data were analysed using descriptive statistics and textual data by descriptive summary. Results A total of 345 survey responses were recorded. Following exclusions, 249 therapists and 40 parents provided data which was 69.6% (289/415) of the target sample size. It was not possible to track the number of people invited to take the survey nor those who viewed, but did not complete, the online questionnaire for calculation of response rates. A completion rate (participants who completed the last page of the survey divided by the participants who completed the first, mandatory, page of the survey) of 42.9% was achieved. Of the three specified trial behaviours, 140/249 (56.2%) therapists were least confident about agreeing to take part in a trial. Therapists (135/249, 52.6%) reported some confidence they could discuss a trial with a parent and child at an appointment. One hundred twenty of 249 (48.2%) therapists reported confidence in sharing information with a research team through questionnaires and interviews or sharing routine health data. Therapists (140/249, 56.2%) felt that taking part in the trial would take a lot of effort and resources. Support and resources, confidence with intervention allocation, and sense of control and professional autonomy over clinical practice were factors that positively affected the acceptability of trials. Of the 40 parents, twelve provided complete data. Most parents (18/40, 45%) agreed that it was clear how trials improve children's therapies and outcomes and that a cluster randomised trial made sense to them in their therapy situation (12/29, 30%). Conclusions Using trials to evaluate therapy interventions is, in principle, acceptable to therapists, but their willingness to participate in trials is variable. The willingness to participate may be particularly influenced by their views related to the burden associated with trials, intervention allocation, and professional autonomy.",,,,,"Kolehmainen, Niina/K-4829-2013","Kolehmainen, Niina/0000-0002-9229-9913; McAnuff, Jennifer/0000-0002-1636-0049; Armitage, Samantha/0000-0002-4231-1865; Pennington, Lindsay/0000-0002-4540-2586; Brooks, Rob/0000-0002-7104-0099; Rapley, Tim/0000-0003-4836-4279",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1745-6215,,,,NOV 26,2022,23,1,,,,,,,958,10.1186/s13063-022-06872-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-022-06872-y,,,,,,,,36435825,,,,,WOS:000888806200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Young MSM (YMSM), particularly Black YMSM, have high HIV incidence, low viral suppression, and low preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence. Therefore, novel approaches to increase the HIV biomedical interventions uptake by YMSM are urgently needed. Objective: We describe the Conectad@s Project, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence and incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, the onset of sexual risk behavior, and barriers to biomedical interventions among YMSM aged 18 to 24 years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and (2) conduct a technology-based adherence intervention study to promote a rapid linkage of YMSM to HIV care or prevention, and support and sustain adherence. Methods: A cross-sectional survey will be conducted with 400 YMSM recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) adapted for social media-based sampling, preceded by a formative phase. HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing will be conducted, including early HIV infection biomarker detection. Behavioral, partnership, network, and structural measures will be collected through structured questionnaires. All individuals recruited for the survey will have access to HIV risk assessment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, prevention counseling, and a technology-based adherence intervention. Those who accept the adherence intervention will receive weekly text messages via a social networking app (WhatsApp) for 24 weeks, with follow-up data collected over 48 weeks. Results: The Conectad@s project has been approved by our local institutional review board (#CAAE 26086719.0.0000.4262) in accordance with all applicable regulations. Questionnaires for the RDS survey and intervention were developed and tested in 2020, formative interviews were conducted in January and February 2021 to guide the development of the RDS, and enrollment is planned to begin in early 2022. Conclusions: The Conectad@s Project is a vanguard study that, for the first time, will apply digital RDS to sample and recruit YMSM in Brazil and rapidly connect them to ART, PrEP, or prevention counseling through a technology-based adherence intervention. RDS will allow us to estimate HIV prevalence among YMSM and measure HIV infection biomarkers in the context of the onset of risky behavior. The data will lay the groundwork to adapt and implement HIV prevention strategies, identify barriers to the earliest HIV infection diagnosis, immediate ART or PrEP initiation, and detect new clusters of HIV transmission.",,,,,"; cardoso, sandra/D-7965-2015","Wilson, Erin/0000-0002-0237-495X; Moreira Jalil, Cristina/0000-0002-8845-3965; Goncalves Veloso dos Santos, Valdilea/0000-0002-6622-3165; Bezerra, Daniel/0000-0003-1353-2762; Hoagland, Brenda/0000-0001-8210-3748; cardoso, sandra/0000-0001-5230-0003",,,,,,,,,,,,,1929-0748,,,,,JAN,2022,11,1,,,,,,,e34885,10.2196/34885,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/34885,,,,,,,,35023848,,,,,WOS:000748995300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It indicates how quickly new generations of cases appear, thus informing on the speed of an epidemic. Estimating the serial interval requires to identify pairs of infectors and infectees. Yet, most studies fail to assess the direction of transmission between cases and assume that the order of infections -and thus transmissions -strictly follows the order of symptom onsets, thereby imposing serial intervals to be positive. Because of the long and highly variable incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, this may not always be true (i.e an infectee may show symptoms before their infector) and negative serial intervals may occur. This study aims to estimate the serial interval of different SARS-CoV-2 variants whilst accounting for negative serial intervals. Methods: This analysis included 5 842 symptomatic individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst 2 579 households from September 2020 to August 2022 across England & Wales. We used a Bayesian framework to infer who infected whom by exploring all transmission trees compatible with the observed dates of symptoms, based on a wide range of incubation period and generation time distributions compatible with estimates reported in the literature. Serial intervals were derived from the reconstructed transmission pairs, stratified by variants.Results: We estimated that 22% (95% credible interval (CrI) 8-32%) of serial interval values are negative across all VOC. The mean serial interval was shortest for Omicron BA5 (2.02 days, 1.26-2.84) and longest for Alpha (3.37 days, 2.52-4.04).Conclusions: This study highlights the large proportion of negative serial intervals across SARS-CoV-2 variants. Because the serial interval is widely used to estimate transmissibility and forecast cases, these results may have critical implications for epidemic control.",,,,,"Cori, Anne/AFL-1641-2022; Geismar, Cyril/GOH-0857-2022","Cori, Anne/0000-0002-8443-9162; Geismar, Cyril/0000-0002-8486-5890; Fragaszy, Ellen/0000-0002-0178-6098; Navaratnam, Annalan/0000-0002-8141-5923; Byrne, Thomas/0000-0001-8667-0870; Kovar, Jana/0000-0002-0477-2767",,,,,,,,,,,,,1755-4365,1878-0067,,,,2023 SEP,2023,44,,,,,,,,100713,10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100713,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100713,,AUG 2023,,,,,,37579586,,,,,WOS:001058091000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The optimal approach to fever management and the optimal temperature thresholds used for treatment in critically ill children are unknown. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different temperature thresholds for antipyretic management. Design: A mixed-methods feasibility study comprising three linked studies -(1) a qualitative study exploring parent and clinician views, (2) an observational study of the epidemiology of fever in children with infection in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and (3) a pilot RCT with an integrated-perspectives study. Setting: Participants were recruited from (1) four hospitals in England via social media (for the FEVER qualitative study), (2) 22 PICUs in the UK (for the FEVER observational study) and (3) four PICUs in England (for the FEVER pilot RCT). Participants: (1) Parents of children with relevant experience were recruited to the FEVER qualitative study, (2) patients who were unplanned admissions to PICUs were recruited to the FEVER observational study and (3) children admitted with infection requiring mechanical ventilation were recruited to the FEVER pilot RCT. Parents of children and clinicians involved in the pilot RCT. Interventions: The FEVER qualitative study and the FEVER observational study had no interventions. In the FEVER pilot RCT, children were randomly allocated (1 : 1) using research without prior consent (RWPC) to permissive (39.5 degrees C) or restrictive (37.5 degrees C) temperature thresholds for antipyretics during their PICU stay while mechanically ventilated. Main outcome measures: (1) The acceptability of FEVER, RWPC and potential outcomes (in the FEVER qualitative study), (2) the size of the potentially eligible population and the temperature thresholds used (in the FEVER observational study) and (3) recruitment and retention rates, protocol adherence and separation between groups and distribution of potential outcomes (in the FEVER pilot RCT). Results: In the FEVER qualitative study, 25 parents were interviewed and 56 clinicians took part in focus groups. Both the parents and the clinicians found the study acceptable. Clinicians raised concerns regarding temperature thresholds and not using paracetamol for pain/discomfort. In the FEVER observational study, 1853 children with unplanned admissions and infection were admitted to 22 PICUs between March and August 2017. The recruitment rate was 10.9 per site per month. The majority of critically ill children with a maximum temperature of >37.5 degrees C received antipyretics. In the FEVER pilot RCT, 100 eligible patients were randomised between September and December 2017 at a recruitment rate of 11.1 per site per month. Consent was provided for 49 out of 51 participants in the restrictive temperature group, but only for 38 out of 49 participants in the permissive temperature group. A separation of 0.5 degrees C (95% confidence interval 0.2 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C) between groups was achieved. A high completeness of outcome measures was achieved. Sixty parents of 57 children took part in interviews and/or completed questionnaires and 98 clinicians took part in focus groups or completed a survey. Parents and clinicians found the pilot RCT and RWPC acceptable. Concerns about children being in pain/discomfort were cited as reasons for withdrawal and non-consent by parents and non-adherence to the protocol by clinicians. Limitations: Different recruitment periods for observational and pilot studies may not fully reflect the population that is eligible for a definitive RCT. Conclusions: The results identified barriers to delivering the definitive FEVER RCT, including acceptability of the permissive temperature threshold. The findings also provided insight into how these barriers may be overcome, such as by limiting the patient inclusion criteria to invasive ventilation only and by improved site training. A definitive FEVER RCT using a modified protocol should be conducted, but further work is required to agree important outcome measures for clinical trials among critically ill children.",,,,,"Klein, Norbert/C-1473-2017; Draper, Elizabeth/S-6874-2019; Peters, Mark/AAD-7518-2019; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan/AAI-6783-2020; Harrison, David A/O-4355-2018; Tume, Lyvonne N/F-5499-2013; Wellman, Paul/GSD-5108-2022","Draper, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9340-8176; Peters, Mark/0000-0003-3653-4808; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan/0000-0003-0784-8154; Harrison, David A/0000-0002-9002-9098; Tume, Lyvonne N/0000-0002-2547-8209; Mouncey, Paul/0000-0002-8510-8517; Khan, Imran/0000-0002-2069-7410; Wulff, Jerome/0000-0003-0071-4970; Mason, Alexina/0000-0001-7319-4545; Deja, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3626-4927; Klein, Nigel/0000-0003-3925-9258; Wellman, Paul/0000-0001-6404-1758; Gould, Doug/0000-0003-4148-3312; Agbeko, Rachel/0000-0001-8931-6869; Woolfall, Kerry/0000-0002-5726-5304; Rowan, Kathryn/0000-0001-8217-5602",,,,,,,,,,,,,1366-5278,2046-4924,,,,FEB,2019,23,5,,,,,1,+,,10.3310/hta23050,http://dx.doi.org/10.3310/hta23050,,,,,,,,30793698,,,,,WOS:000459295700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Affective disorders, Environment, and Cognitive Trait (AFFECT) study presents an opportunity to identify and associate the structure of cognition and symptom-level domains across the mood disorder spectrum in a prospective study from a diverse US population. Participants were recruited from the 23andMe, Inc research participant database and through social media; self-reported diagnosis of MD or BD by a medical professional and medication status data were used to enrich for mood-disorder cases. Remote assessments were used to acquire an extensive range of phenotypes, including mood state, transdiagnostic symptom severity, task-based measures of cognition, environmental exposures, personality traits. In this paper we describe the study design, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort. In addition we report genetic ancestry, SNP heritability, and genetic correlations with other large cohorts of mood disorders. A total of 48,467 participants were enrolled: 14,768 with MD, 9864 with BD, and 23,835 controls. Upon enrollment, 47% of participants with MD and 27% with BD indicated being in an active mood episode. Cases reported early ages of onset (mean = 13.2 and 14.3 years for MD and BD, respectively), and high levels of recurrence (78.6% and 84.9% with >5 episodes), psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication use. SNP heritability on the liability scale for the ascertained MD participants (0.19-0.21) was consistent with the high level of disease severity in this cohort, while BD heritability estimates (0.16-0.22) were comparable to reports in other large scale genomic studies of mood disorders. Genetic correlations between the AFFECT cohort and other large-scale cohorts were high for MD but not for BD. By incorporating transdiagnostic symptom assessments, repeated measures, and genomic data, the AFFECT study represents a unique resource for dissecting the structure of mood disorders across multiple levels of analysis. In addition, the fully remote nature of the study provides valuable insights for future virtual and decentralized clinical trials within mood disorders.",,,,,"Vitezic, Morana/A-6165-2013; tian, chao/GYD-3462-2022; Buckholtz, Joshua/E-7299-2010","Vitezic, Morana/0000-0002-7994-9600; Hinds, David/0000-0002-4911-803X; Dalby, Maria/0000-0001-6018-3468; Buckholtz, Joshua/0000-0002-9418-8686",,,,,,,,,,,,,2158-3188,,,,,MAR 25,2022,12,1,,,,,,,121,10.1038/s41398-022-01877-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-01877-2,,,,,,,,35338122,,,,,WOS:000773248600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to better understand the unmet needs of nocturnal symptoms management, we analyzed the characteristics and burden of nocturnal symptoms from patients' perspectives and explored their changes over time. Overall symptoms (occurring at day or night) were collected to compare whether the unmet needs related to nocturnal symptoms and to overall symptoms are different. Methods We used a Social Listening big-data technique to analyze large amounts of Parkinson's disease symptoms in dialogues available from social media platforms in 2016 to 2018. These symptoms were classified as either overall symptoms or nocturnal symptoms. We used share of voice (SOV) of symptoms as a proportion of total dialogues per year to reflect the characteristics of symptoms. Negative sentiment score of symptoms was analyzed to find out their related burden. Results We found the SOV for overall motor symptoms was 79% and had not increased between 2016 and 2018 (79%, p = 0.5). The SOV for non-motor symptoms was 69% and had grown by 7% in 2018 (p < 0.01). The SOV for motor complications was 9% and had increased by 6% in 2018 (p < 0.01). The SOV of motor symptoms was larger than non-motor symptoms and motor complications (p < 0.01). The SOV of non-motor symptoms was larger than motor complications (p < 0.01). For nocturnal symptoms, 45% of the analyzed PD population reported nocturnal symptoms in 2018, growing by 6% (p < 0.01). The SOV for nocturnal-occurring motor symptoms was higher than most non-motor symptoms. However, non-motor symptoms had the higher increases and evoked higher negative sentiment regardless of whether they occurred during the day or night. For symptoms that can occur at either day or night, each nocturnal symptom was rated with a higher negative sentiment score than the same symptom during the day. Conclusions The growing SOV and the greater negative sentiment of nocturnal symptoms suggest management of nocturnal symptoms is an unmet need of patients.

To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at least 70-85% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus post-vaccination. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and side effects were collected. Results: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25-34 years (38.6%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7% had received Covishield and 17.8% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1% have received both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9% had received only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated individuals had a gap of 4-5 weeks for the second dose (37.1%) followed by 5-6 weeks (11.2%). Post-vaccination 50.8% had experienced muscle pain, 46% had experienced fatigue, 36.5% weakness, and 12.3% back pain. Among vaccinated 26% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and 44.5% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the second time experienced either through vaccination or infection demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening complications. Conclusion: Although more than 50% of the vaccinated individuals experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high acceptance rate (74%) of vaccination among the participants. The vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to the non-vaccinated individuals.",,,,,"Muthu, Sathish/G-5756-2018; Jeyaraman, Madhan/ABB-8464-2020","Muthu, Sathish/0000-0002-7143-4354; Jeyaraman, Madhan/0000-0002-9045-9493",,,,,,,,,,,,,2452-0918,2213-3984,,,,2022 MAR-APR,2022,14,,,,,,,,100983,10.1016/j.cegh.2022.100983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2022.100983,,FEB 2022,,,,,,35155844,,,,,WOS:000819926400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes a cloud-centric IoT-based health management framework and develops a system prototype that integrates sensors and digital technology. The IoT-based health management tool can collect real-time health data and transmit it to the cloud, thus transforming the signals of various sensors into shared content that users can understand. This study explores whether individuals in need tend to use the proposed IoT-based technology for health management, which may lead to the new development of digital healthcare in the direction of sensors. The novelty of this research lies in extending the research perspective of sensors from the technical level to the user level and explores how individuals understand and adopt sensors based on innovatively applying the IoT to health management systems. By organically combining TAM with MOA theory, we propose a comprehensive model to explain why individuals develop perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and risk regarding systems based on factors related to motivation, opportunity, and ability. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the online survey data collected from respondents. The results showed that perceived usefulness and ease of use positively impacted adoption intention, Perceived ease of use positively affected perceived usefulness. Perceived risk had a negative impact on adoption intention. Readiness was only positively related to perceived usefulness, while external benefits were positively related to perceived ease of use and negatively related to perceived risk. Facilitative conditions were positively correlated with perceived ease of use and negatively correlated with perceived risk. Technical efficacy was positively related to perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.

They have also become personalisable standing as a fashion statement. This combination resulted in staggering adoption rates recently leading to question whether smartwatch users' choice and use satisfaction emerge from utility features or from its fashion characteristics. This paper proposes and validates a fit theory to investigate the antecedents of adopters' satisfaction. Besides evaluating fit with identity, the model assesses both perceived and actual task-technology fit of smartwatches. A questionnaire-based quantitative approach is used to collect data from about 300 smartwatch users in Qatar. To test the proposed model, data is analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Furthermore, ANN sensitivity analysis ranks the importance of the fit factors affecting users' choice during pre- and post-adoption stages. Both task-technology and technology-identity fit factors are quasi-equally important in explaining 62% of satisfaction variance. ANN analysis revealed that post-adoption satisfaction is primarily attributed to smartwatches' ability to fit with users' identity and secondarily to its perceived fit with tasks. Nevertheless, pre-adoption choice of smartwatches is mainly guided by their functionality. This paper is the first to propose and validate an integrated task-technology-identity fit model to explain smartwatch utilization and users' satisfaction. The originality also lies in assessing actual task-technology fit and as perceived by users.

Objective: We sought to evaluate the overall success of this change and to identify what types of practice settings, provider groups, and patient groups were best served by telepsychiatry and telepsychotherapy utilization. We were particularly inter-ested in how providers of consultation-liaison psychiatry adapted to remote care. Methods: An anonymous provider survey querying demographics, education, training, technological experience, practice setting, treatment modalities, patient groups, transition process, and outcomes was made openly available via social media and professional listservs. We used multivariable regression modeling to evaluate for predictors of the positive outcomes of overall satisfaction, subjective ability to diagnose and treat patients adequately using exclusively telepsychiatric platforms, and patient satisfaction by proxy. Results: Three hundred thirty-three respondents, mostly young (59.4% younger than 50 years), female (69.7%), and physicians (67.9%), completed the survey. One hundred ninety-seven (59.1%) worked in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Of the total, 85.9% gave affirmative answers to overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression models found that satisfaction was predicted by general comfort with technology (P < 0.001), but negatively correlated with having technical issues (P < 0.001), a priori skepticism (P < 0.001), clinician being male (P = 0.004), and treating LGBTQ+ patients (P = 0.022). Completeness was associated with having training in tele-health (P = 0.039) and general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) but negatively associated with treating LGBTQ+ patients (P = 0.024) or inpatients (P = 0.002). Patient satisfaction by proxy was positively associated with general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) and the respondent being a nonphysician (P = 0.004) and negatively associated with encountering a technical issue (P = 0.013) or treating inpatients (P = 0.045). Consultation-liaison psychiatrists had similar results overall and were more likely to have other staff assist in making televisits effective (mean [standard deviation]: -1.25 [3.57] versus -2.76 [3.27], P < 0.001) especially if consultative (mean [standard deviation]: -0.87 [3.67] versus -2.39 [3.01], P = 0.010). Conclusions: This study suggests high rates of overall satisfaction in telepsychiatry adoption, even in consultation -liaison psychiatry.

It was noticed that 41.6% of consumers used the nutritional information sometimes and 14.7% always, mainly because they liked to know what they were buying and consuming (35.8%). Lack of patience (29.5%) and concern about the composition of the food purchased (34.2%) were the main reasons for not using the information provided. commonly used nutrition claim was trans fat-free (42.5%) and the type of food in which nutrition labeling was used most was milk and dairy products (42.0%). Frequent use of nutritional information was higher among women (p<0.01) and among those who practice physical activity (p=0.04). Many individuals relied on food labels nutritional information (61.9%), but out of these, 43.6% did not use that information at the time of purchase. There was no difference between respondents' confidence in the information, sociodemographic and health data. Conclusion Many people still do not use the label nutrition information. Efforts should be made to change this scenario. Changes in nutrition labeling can help modify this situation, with the use of clearer label information, more easily understood, that does not raise any doubts in the consumers' mind.",,,,,,"Opolski Medeiros, Caroline/0000-0001-7299-9149; Sousa, Lisane/0000-0001-9206-3364; Selke Costa, Esther Heyde/0000-0001-7456-0711; Stangarlin-fiori, lize/0000-0001-7904-904X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1415-5273,,,,,,2020,33,,,,,,,,e190199,10.1590/1678-9865202033e190199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-9865202033e190199,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000540088800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An Online Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jordan in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at national and international levels were directed to mitigate the spread of the disease and its physical harm, paying less attention to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at early stages of the pandemic. Objectives This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions have explored our study's second and third aims. Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR = 0.64, P = 0.022; 95% CI: 0.44-0.94), and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, P = 0.048; 95% CI: 0.01-0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, P = 0.049; 95% CI: 1.10-3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR = 2.49, P = 0.007; 95% CI: 1.29-4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media platforms (n = 269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning as their most distressing concern. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the mental health of individuals, including students.

We aimed to develop a risk of bias (RoB) tool to assess NMAs (RoB NMA tool). An international steering committee recommended that the RoB NMA tool to be used in combination with the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool (i.e. because it was designed to assess biases only) or other similar quality appraisal tools (eg, A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 [AMSTAR 2]) to assess quality of systematic reviews. The RoB NMA tool will assess NMA biases and limitations regarding how the analysis was planned, data were analysed and results were presented, including the way in which the evidence was assembled and interpreted. Objectives Conduct (a) a Delphi process to determine expert opinion on an item's inclusion and (b) a knowledge user survey to widen its impact. Design Cross-sectional survey and Delphi process. Methods Delphi panellists were asked to rate whether items should be included. All agreed-upon item were included in a second round of the survey (defined as 70% agreement). We surveyed knowledge users' views and preferences about the importance, utility and willingness to use the RoB NMA tool to evaluate evidence in practice and in policymaking. We included 12 closed and 10 open-ended questions, and we followed a knowledge translation plan to disseminate the survey through social media and professional networks. Results 22 items were entered into a Delphi survey of which 28 respondents completed round 1, and 22 completed round 2. Seven items did not reach consensus in round 2. A total of 298 knowledge users participated in the survey (14% respondent rate). 75% indicated that their organisation produced NMAs, and 78% showed high interest in the tool, especially if they had received adequate training (84%). Most knowledge users and Delphi panellists preferred a tool to assess both bias in individual NMA results and authors' conclusions. Response bias in our sample is a major limitation as knowledge users working in high-income countries were more represented. One of the limitations of the Delphi process is that it depends on the purposive selection of experts and their availability, thus limiting the variability in perspectives and scientific disciplines.

This challenge has been spearheaded by the huge interest in the 4Ps of health care (predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory). Big Data offers striking development opportunities in health care and life sciences. Healthcare research is already using Big Data to analyze the spatial distribution of diseases such as diabetes mellitus at detailed geographic levels. Big Data is also being used to assess location-specific risk factors based on data of health insurance claims. Other studies in systems medicine utilize bioinformatics approaches to human biology which necessitate Big Data statistical analysis and medical informatics tools. Big Data is also being used to develop electronic algorithms to forecast clinical events in real time, with the intent to improve patient outcomes and thus reduce costs. Yet, this Big Data era also poses critically difficult ethical challenges, since it is breaking down the traditional divisions between what belongs to public and private domains in health care and health research. Big Data in health care raises complex ethical concerns due to use of huge datasets obtained from different sources for varying reasons. The clinical translation of this Big Data is thus resulting in key ethical and epistemological challenges for those who use these data to generate new knowledge and the clinicians who eventually apply it to improve patient care. Underlying this challenge is the fact that patient consent often cannot be collected for the use of individuals' personal data which then forms part of this Big Data. There is also the added dichotomy of healthcare providers which use such Big Data in attempts to reduce healthcare costs, and the negative impact this may have on the individual with respect to privacy issues and potential discrimination. Big Data thus challenges societal norms of privacy and consent. Many questions are being raised on how these huge masses of data can be managed into valuable information and meaningful knowledge, while still maintaining ethical norms. Maintaining ethical integrity may lack behind in such a fast-changing sphere of knowledge. There is also an urgent need for international cooperation and standards when considering the ethical implications of the use of Big Data-intensive information. This chapter will consider some of the main ethical aspects of this fast-developing field in the provision of health care, health research, and public health. It will use examples to concretize the discussion, such as the ethical aspects of the applications of Big Data obtained from clinical trials, and the use of Big Data obtained from the increasing popularity of health mobile apps and social media sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2398-6018,,978-1-78743-571-1; 978-1-78743-572-8,,,,2019,4,,,,,,63,83,,10.1108/S2398-601820180000004005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S2398-601820180000004005,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000842437600006,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Gao, S; Wang, HY",,,,"Gao, Shan; Wang, Hanyi",,,Scenario prediction of public health emergencies using infectious disease dynamics model and dynamic Bayes,FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study was aimed to discuss the predictive value of infectious disease dynamics model (IDD model) and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for scenario deduction of public health emergencies (PHEs). Based on the evolution law of PHEs and the meta-scenario representation of basic knowledge, this study established a DBN scenario deduction model for scenario deduction and evolution path analysis of PHEs. At the same time, based on the average field dynamics model of the SIR network, the dimensionality reduction process was performed to calculate the epidemic scale and epidemic time based on the IDD model, so as to determine the calculation methods of threshold value and epidemic time under emergency measures (quarantine). The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) epidemic was undertaken as an example to analyze the results of DBN scenario deduction, and the infectious disease dynamics model was used to analyze the number of reproductive numbers, peak arrival time, epidemic time, and latency time of the COVID epidemic. It was found that after the M1 measure was used to process the S1 state, the state probability and the probability of being true (T) were the highest, which were 91.05 and 90.21, respectively. In the sixth stage of the development of the epidemic, the epidemic had developed to level 5, the number of infected people was about 26, and the estimated loss was about 220 million yuan. The comprehensive cumulative foreground (CF) values of O1 similar to O3 schemes were -1.34, -1.21, and -0.77, respectively, and the final CF values were -1.35, 0.01, and-0.08, respectively. The final CF value of O2 was significantly higher than the other two options. The household infection probability was the highest, which was 0.37 and 0.35 in Wuhan and China, respectively. Under the measures of home quarantine, the numbers of confirmed cases of COVID in China and Wuhan were 1.503 (95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.328 similar to 1.518) and 1.729 (95% CI = 1.107 similar to 1.264), respectively, showing good fits with the real data. On the 21st day after the quarantine measures were taken, the number of COVID across the country had an obvious peak, with the confirmed cases of 24495, and the model prediction value was 24085 (95% CI = 23988 similar to 25056). The incubation period 1/q was shortened from 8 days to 3 days, and the number of confirmed cases showed an upward trend. The peak period of confirmed cases was advanced, shortening the overall epidemic time. It showed that the prediction results of scenario deduction based on DBN were basically consistent with the actual development scenario and development status of the epidemic. It could provide corresponding decisions for the prevention and control of COVID based on the relevant parameters of the infectious disease dynamic model, which verified the rationality and feasibility of the scenario deduction method proposed in this study.

Beyond the Boundaries of Fatality, Enhancing Clinical Skills and Precision Medicine",THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL RISK MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dissemination and exploitation of knowledge regarding affordable clinical skills and innovative precision medicine, two current topics in active development in medicine, may contribute to improve also sepsis management. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is strongly related to all body organs or to systemic diseases and to the quality of the best-practice in use, which is particularly critical in surgical or intervention techniques. Trauma, surgical and mini-invasive procedures, vascular or endoscopic interventions, otolaryngology, obstetrics-gynecological and urological procedures, malnutrition, dental, skin, chronic liver, kidney and respiratory disease are frequently involved. Accordingly, apart from the clinical risk analysis and management of the process of care, the actual factors that may be easily neglected are the techniques used, the personal skills of the health professionals and the quality of the equipment. The quest for biomarkers consistent with the unmet needs of medical doctors and of their patient and the efforts for overcoming bacterial antibiotic resistances are currently the main foci of medical research. In addition, in this regard, research and innovation would benefit from greater knowledge, skills and use of bioinformatics and omics. The caveats related to in-silico approaches must be flagged: algorithms may equally warrant scientific innovations or hide the lack of them; a patient is more than a set of covariates. Epidemiology and prevention includes all the actions suitable for achieving an adequate hygiene and immunization of populations and for safer hospital policies and procedures during Patients' stays. In any subset, the most unresolved critical point in sepsis is a timely diagnosis. This is impaired by low degrees of suspicion for the possibility of emerging sepsis, by the shortage of use of the simplest microbiological testing but, equally or more, by the insufficient diffusion of non-invasive imaging skills suitable to detect and monitor the emerging sites and sources of infection. In primary care, in emergency facilities, in hospital wards and in intensive care units, inclusion of appropriate knowledge, skills, expertise and imaging equipment must be extended as much as possible. The low cost of UltraSound machines and of increasing bioinformatics literacy by e-learning, makes such investments affordable even in limited-resources contexts. Frontier educational and best practice intervention enhancing affordable clinical skills and innovative precision medicine may lead beyond the boundaries of fatal outcomes in sepsis.",,,,,,"Trovato, Guglielmo M/0000-0002-1168-1919",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1178-203X,,,,,2020,16,,,,,,87,93,,10.2147/TCRM.S232530,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S232530,,,,,,,,32103969,,,,,WOS:000519210600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Khalid",,,Family resilience and neighborhood factors affect the association between digital media use and mental health among children: does sleep mediate the association?,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The associations between digital media use and mental well-being among children and adolescents have been inconclusive. We examined (i) the associations between digital media use and mental health outcomes, anxiety, depression, and ADHD, (ii) whether family resilience and neighborhood factors attenuate the associations, and (iii) whether sleep mediates these associations. We used the National Survey of Children's Health data from 2019 to 2020. A total of 45,989 children's (6-17 years) data were analyzed in this study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between digital media use and anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Path models and Paramed command in STATA were used to test the role of sleep as a mediator of these associations. The prevalence of heavy digital media users (who spent 4 or more hours per day) among the analytic sample was 30.52%, whereas anxiety was 13.81%, depression was 5.93%, and ADHD was 12.41%. Children in the heavy media user group had 63% increased odds of anxiety (95% CI: 1.32-2.01) and 99% increased odds of depression (95% CI: 1.35-2.94) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, compared to the children in light media user group (who spent < 2 h per day), and these relations were significant at 0.01 level. However, family resilience and community factors significantly attenuated the effect of digital media use on anxiety and depression. Sleep did not mediate the associations between digital media use and anxiety or depression.Conclusions: Family resilience and neighborhood factors protect against the harmful effects of digital media use.

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID -19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. Results: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. Conclusions: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.",,,,,"Leocani, Letizia/ABH-4703-2020; Costa, Gloria Dalla/F-6440-2017; Folarin, Amos Akinola/IWE-0229-2023; Lamers, Femke/G-5161-2012; Sun, Shaoxiong/GOK-0990-2022; Wykes, Til/B-3812-2011; Wykes, Til/AFE-8438-2022; Matcham, Faith/AAW-8550-2021; SIDDI, SARA/O-5771-2017; Zabalza, Ana/AAX-5767-2020; Penninx, Brenda WJH/S-7627-2017; Myin Germeys, Inez/HIR-3364-2022; Wykes, Til/AAE-9718-2022; Haro, Josep Maria/D-1423-2011; dobson, richard/C-9269-2011","Costa, Gloria Dalla/0000-0002-8761-9337; Folarin, Amos Akinola/0000-0002-0333-1927; Wykes, Til/0000-0002-5881-8003; Wykes, Til/0000-0002-5881-8003; SIDDI, SARA/0000-0002-1494-9028; Zabalza, Ana/0000-0003-3860-5251; Penninx, Brenda WJH/0000-0001-7779-9672; Myin Germeys, Inez/0000-0002-3731-4930; Wykes, Til/0000-0002-5881-8003; Haro, Josep Maria/0000-0002-3984-277X; Ranjan, Yatharth/0000-0003-3079-3120; Rintala, Aki/0000-0002-0066-4697; , Ana Isabel/0000-0001-5891-2123; Rashid, Zulqarnain/0000-0002-6843-9920; Stewart, Callum/0000-0001-9947-8677; Leocani, Letizia/0000-0001-9326-6753; dobson, richard/0000-0003-4224-9245; Matcham, Faith/0000-0002-4055-904X; Conde, Pauline/0000-0003-0513-0915",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,SEP 25,2020,22,9,,,,,,,e19992,10.2196/19992,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19992,,,,,,,,32877352,,,,,WOS:000599327200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods Using the GUI98 cohort, we used separate weekday and weekend time-based categorical variables indicating time spent online, playing video games, watching TV/films as well as a frequency variable indicating multiscreening, and their associations with SDQ internalizing and externalizing symptoms using linear and quadratic regression parameters. We followed procedures for confounder adjustments outlined in Przybylski and Weinstein (Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017). Results As hypothesized by the Goldilocks Hypothesis, time spent online watching TV/films at the weekend and multiscreening all had curvilinear relationships with internalizing and externalizing symptoms with significantly higher symptoms for no time as well as for higher exposures. internalizing and externalizing symptoms increased with time spent playing video games. Conclusions This brief report supports the Goldilocks Hypothesis, that suggests that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may instead be beneficial, even necessary in a world becoming ever more increasingly reliant on digital media (Przybylski and Weinstein in Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017).",,,,,,"Stanistreet, Debbi/0000-0003-3738-1727; Brannigan, Ross/0000-0002-3844-0250",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,2023 AUG,2023,58,8,,,,,1259,1264,,10.1007/s00127-022-02352-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02352-5,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36071142,,,,,WOS:000850754800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given that the internet has become a major source of health information, especially among the young, the internet is a powerful tool of communication and has a significant influence on patients. Objective: This study aimed to clarify the features of patients' interest in and evaluate the quality of information about acne vulgaris on the internet. Methods: We compared the search volumes on acne vulgaris with those of other dermatological diseases using Google Trends from January 2004 to August 2019. We also determined the search volumes for relevant keywords of acne vulgaris on Google and Naver and evaluated the quality of answers to the queries in KnowledgeiN. Results: The regression analysis of Google Trends data demonstrated that the patients' interest in acne vulgaris was higher than that for other dermatological diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (beta=-20.33, 95% CI -22.27 to -18.39, P<.001) and urticaria (beta=-27.09, 95% CI -29.03 to -25.15, P<.001) and has increased yearly (beta=2.38, 95% CI 2.05 to 2.71, P<.001). The search volume for acne vulgaris was significantly higher in the summer than in the spring (beta=-5.04, 95% CI -9.21 to -0.88, P=.018) and on weekends than on weekdays (beta=-6.68, 95% CI -13.18 to -0.18, P=.044). The most frequently searched relevant keywords with acne vulgaris and cause were stress, food, and cosmetics. Among food, the 2 highest acne vulgaris-related keywords were milk and wheat in Naver and coffee and ramen in Google. The queries in Naver KnowledgeiN were mostly answered by a Korean traditional medicine doctor (53.4%) or the public (33.6%), but only 12.0% by dermatologists. Conclusions: Physicians should be aware of patients' interest in and beliefs about acne vulgaris to provide the best patient education and care, both online and in the clinic.",,,,,,"Park, Suyeon/0000-0002-6391-557X; Kim, Sooyoung/0000-0002-0547-645X; Kim, Woo Il/0000-0001-7127-2992; Park, Tae Heum/0000-0002-7408-8848",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,OCT 26,2020,22,10,,,,,,,e19427,10.2196/19427,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19427,,,,,,,,33104003,,,,,WOS:000600319400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Developed countries have a higher incidence than in developing countries. Because of the lack of studies on PCa in Saudi Arabia, our study aims to measure the awareness about PCa and knowledge of PCa screening practices among men in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study conducted among males in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from 2(nd) to 10(th) July 2020, using a validated questionnaire. The sample size was 1212 participants. Data collected through an online questionnaire. All data analyses performed using (SPSS) software, using the Chi-square test for bivariate analysis. All levels of significance were set at P < 0.05. Results: We collected 1212 completed surveys, with mean ages of 36 years (standard deviation 12.77). We found that 77% of participants heard about PCa, and 52.5% heard about PCa screening tests. This study showed that only 10.6% of all participants had good knowledge, 41.9% had fair knowledge, and 47.5% had poor knowledge. Only 3.9% of participants had experienced the prostate-specific antigen test. Conclusion: The study showed that the level of knowledge of PCa is low. Thus, community and individuals should collaborate to increase awareness by having more awareness campaigns, disseminating the information through the media, and encouraging men to do screening tests as indicated.

This study was conducted to assess the sleep quality and psychological states of the Bangladeshi population during the COVID-19 pandemic, respondent's behavioral traits as well as psychological or sleep-related problems induced self-medication practice among the respondents, along with the probability of development of drug dependency. Methods: The survey was conducted among 2941 respondents from 25th November 2020 to 4th December 2020 where the responses were analyzed by SPSS V22. Results: 10-29.5% experienced a significant degree of sleep problems whereas some experienced severe anxiety and depression. The associations between the behavioral traits and parameters concerning sleep quality, anxiety and depression showed 5% level of significance in all cases. Self-medication practice of sleep aids during this pandemic was reported by 7.14% of the respondents, with a greater percentage belonging to the female or senior age group. Tendency to repeatedly self-medication was observed in 18.86% of this self-medicating populace, and a greater number of male (10.26%) respondents displayed such tendency as opposed to their female (8.6%) equivalents. However, 48.10% of the respondents reported perceptions of improved physical and/or psychological health following self-medication, and this trait was predominant in men (52.14%). Conclusion: Results showed a significant number of Bangladeshi populaces were suffering from psychological issues during this COVID-19 which also influenced a certain number of people towards self-medication practice where signs of drug dependency were observed in a significant number of respondents.",,,,,,"Binte Bahar, Nasiba/0000-0002-5981-3220; HOSSAIN, S.M.

Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for patients with TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on this patient population. We aimed to characterise differences in casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI across different levels of human development. Methods We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience sample of hospitals identified by open invitation, through international and regional scientific societies and meetings, individual contacts, and social media. Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each hospital's 30-day study period were all eligible for inclusion, with the exception of patients undergoing insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor only, ventriculostomy placement only, or a procedure for drainage of a chronic subdural haeinatoma. The primary outcome was mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation if the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were stratified according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite of life expectancy, education, and income measures-into very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI, and low HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the effect of HDI on mortality while accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and between-country variation. Findings Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57 countries, collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20%) records were from countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33%) from countries in the high HDI tier, 614 (38%) from countries in the medium HDI tier, and 154 (9%) from countries in the low HDI tier. The median age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the oldest patients in the very high HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the youngest in the low HDI tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common procedures were elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69 [45%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the medium HDI tier (189 [31%]) and high HDI tier (173 [32%]), and evacuation of a supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high HDI tier (155 [47%]). Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 18% (299 of 1635). After adjustment for casernix, the odds of mortality were greater in the medium HDI tier (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.55-5.2) and high HDI tier (2.26, 1.23-4.15), but not the low HDI tier (1.66, 0.61-4.46), relative to the very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in mortality (median OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.17-2.49). Interpretation Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI differed considerably in their admission characteristics and management across human development settings. Level of human development was associated with mortality. Substantial opportunities to improve care globally were identified, including reducing delays to surgery. Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests changes at an institutional level could influence outcome and comparative effectiveness research could identify best practices.

These trends have implications for etiology and prevention and suggest new and emerging risk factors in need of attention. The present study estimated age, period, and cohort effects in depressive symptoms among US nationally representative samples of school attending adolescents from 1991 to 2018.MethodsData are drawn from 1991 to 2018 Monitoring the Future yearly cross-sectional surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students (N=1,260,159). Depressive symptoms measured with four questions that had consistent wording and data collection procedures across all 28years. Age-period-cohort effects estimated using the hierarchical age-period-cohort models.ResultsAmong girls, depressive symptoms decreased from 1991 to 2011, then reversed course, peaking in 2018; these increases reflected primarily period effects, which compared to the mean of all periods showed a gradual increase starting in 2012 and peaked in 2018 (estimate=1.15, p<0.01). Cohort effects were minimal, indicating that increases are observed across all age groups. Among boys, trends were similar although the extent of the increase is less marked compared to girls; there was a declining cohort effect among recently born cohorts, suggesting that increases in depressive symptoms among boys are slower for younger boys compared to older boys in recent years.

Despite attempts to promote formal help sites (e.g. governmental and charity sector) in internet search results, users' evaluation of these sites is lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to explore distressed users' perceptions of formal online help and their experiences of using this in times of crisis. Methods In-depth interview study of 53 adults reporting suicide-related internet use. Results While highly valued in relation to general mental health problems, formal sites were not perceived to meet the different needs of those experiencing suicidal thoughts, and did not engage individuals in crisis. Sites were criticised for being impersonal, dispassionate, too focused on information-giving, and lacking solutions that were novel or sensitive to reasons why an individual may choose to seek help online. Most participants criticised the tendency for sites to signpost to offline services as their primary response. Participants desired immediacy and responsive online help incorporating 'live chat', self-help tools, opportunities to interact with others and lived-experience content. Positive accounts of seeking online help described sites incorporating these features. Conclusions Formal online help services should be reappraised to ensure they meet users' needs for immediacy and responsive help to capitalise upon the opportunity available for suicide prevention.",,,,,"Gunnell, David/ABE-6653-2020","Gunnell, David/0000-0002-0829-6470; Biddle, Lucy/0000-0002-1090-8771; derges, jane/0000-0003-3973-3212",,,,,,,,,,,,,0933-7954,1433-9285,,,,2020 SEP,2020,55,9,,,,,1157,1166,,10.1007/s00127-020-01852-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01852-6,,MAR 2020,,,,,,32157324,,,,,WOS:000562574400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar (a reference area).

We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk. Methods We did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms. We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test. The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509. Findings Among 2 035 395 community individuals and 99 795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34 435 272 person-days. Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11.61, 95% CI 10.93-12.33). To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3.40, 95% CI 3.37-3.43). Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors. Interpretation In the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers. Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

By understanding drivers of different trajectories, interventions can be better targeted and more effective. One such driver may be a person's physical activity identity (PAI)-the extent to which a person perceives PA as central to who they are. Methods: Using survey information and a unique body of essays written at age 11 from the National Child Development Study (N = 10 500), essays mentioning PA were automatically identified using the machine learning technique support vector classification and PA trajectories were estimated using latent class analysis. Analyses tested the extent to which childhood PAI correlated with activity levels from age 23 through 55 and with trajectories across adulthood. Results: 42.2% of males and 33.5% of females mentioned PA in their essays, describing active and/or passive engagement. Active PAI in childhood was correlated with higher levels of activity for men but not women, and was correlated with consistently active PA trajectories for both genders. Passive PAI was not related to PA for either gender. Conclusions: This study offers a novel approach for analysing large qualitative datasets to assess identity and behaviours. Findings suggest that at as young as 11 years old, the way a young person conceptualizes activity as part of their identity has a lasting association with behaviour. Still, an active identity may require a supportive sociocultural context to manifest in subsequent behaviour.",,,,,"Kern, Margaret/T-3661-2018","Kern, Margaret/0000-0003-4300-598X; Carpentieri, JD/0000-0001-7550-1676; Pongiglione, Benedetta/0000-0001-8539-1554",,,,,,,,,,,,,0300-5771,1464-3685,,,,OCT,2020,49,5,,,,,1749,1758,,10.1093/ije/dyaa131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa131,,,,,,,,33011758,,,,,WOS:000606715400046,View Full Record in Web of Science

They feed on a wide variety of small animals, including rodents, such as mice or rats. The occurrence of this parasite in polecats from Romania was mentioned only once in 1991, but the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular biology. The study aimed to investigate the occurrence of Trichinela spp. in European polecats from Romania and to identify the parasite species by molecular tools. A total of 75 wild European polecats were examined by trichinoscopy and artificial digestion. A large number of animals were examined because of their wide distribution in Romanian territory and their presence near human settlements. For species determination, the positive muscle samples and the larvae recovered from artificial digestion were collected for DNA isolation and further processed by means of Multiplex PCR. Only two polecats from southern Romania tested positive for Trichinella spp. infection. During trichinoscopy examination, 48 (in a polecat from Giurgiu County) and 78 (in a polecat from Ialomia County) cysts were found in the tested (56 samples/animal) tissue samples. Artificial digestion revealed infection with 2466 larvae/100 g of muscle in the polecat from Ialomia and 254/100 g in the polecat from Giurgiu. The Multiplex PCR indicated the occurrence of Trichinella spiralis in the polecat from Giurgiu and a co-infection with T. spiralis and T. britovi in the polecat from Ialomia.

Methods We recruited men aged 18 years or over who were not at risk of suicide to participate in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned (1: 1) via computer randomisation to view Man Up (the intervention) or a control documentary. We hypothesised that 4 weeks after viewing Man Up participants would report higher levels of intention to seek help than those who viewed the control documentary. Our primary outcome was assessed using the General Help Seeking Questionnaire, and was analysed for all participants. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616001169437, Universal Trial Number: U1111-1186-1459) and was funded by the Movember Foundation. Results Three hundred and fifty-four men were assessed for eligibility for the trial and randomised to view Man Up or the control documentary.

We examined the prevalence of IA and its association with QOL in clinically stable patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: In a cross-sectional survey between September 2020 and July 2021, the Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief version scale (WHOQOL-BREF) were administered to 1267 patients with MDD.

Results: The prevalence of IA (IAT total scores >= 50) was 27.2 % (95 % CI: 24.7 %-29.6 %) in MDD patients. Compared to patients without IA, those with IA had lower QOL (F( 1, 1267) = 19.1, P < 0.001).

We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus Watch-a large community cohort study based in England and Wales-reported differential exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the autumn-winter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation. Methods Participants (n=20 120-25 228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during 3 weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants' residential postcode using English or Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed-effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period. Results Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) range across time points: 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR: 3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR: 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR: 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR: 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods. Conclusion Differential exposure to essential public activities-such as attending workplaces and visiting essential shops-is likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes.

Current national guidance on COPD management recommends addressing bone health in patients, however, does not detail how. This consensus outlines key elements of a structured approach to managing bone health and fracture risk in patients with COPD. Methods: A systematic approach incorporating multifaceted methodologies included detailed patient and healthcare professional (HCP) surveys followed by a roundtable meeting to reach a consensus on what a pathway would look like. Results: The surveys revealed that fracture risk was not always assessed despite being recognised as an important aspect of COPD management by HCPs. The majority of the patients also stated they would be receptive to discussing treatment options if found to be at risk of osteoporotic fractures. Limited time and resource allocation were identified as barriers to addressing bone health during consultations. The consensus from the roundtable meeting was that a proactive systematic approach to assessing bone health should be adopted. This should involve using fracture risk assessment tools to identify individuals at risk, investigating secondary causes of osteoporosis if a diagnosis is made and reinforcing non-pharmacological and preventative measures such as smoking cessation, keeping active and pharmacological management of osteoporosis and medicines management of corticosteroid use. Practically, prioritising patients with important additional risk factors, such as previous fragility fractures, older age and long-term oral corticosteroid use for an assessment, was felt required. Conclusion: There is a need for integrating fracture risk assessment into the COPD pathway. Developing a systematic and holistic approach to addressing bone health is key to achieving this. In tandem, opportunities to disseminate the information and educational resources are also required.",,,,,"Bolton, Charlotte E/S-9589-2017","Bolton, Charlotte E/0000-0002-9578-2249; Sahota, Opinder/0000-0003-0055-7637",,,,,,,,,,,,,1178-2005,,,,,,2020,15,,,,,,1377,1390,,10.2147/COPD.S233398,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S233398,,,,,,,,32606647,,,,,WOS:000540425400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design Prospective cohort feasibility study. Setting 13 general practices in West Midlands of England. Participants Patients aged 8-19 years who consult their general practice about a musculoskeletal condition. Patients were identified via a relevant musculoskeletal Read code entered at the point of consultation. Outcome measures Feasibility was assessed in terms of study processes (recruitment rates), data collection procedures (duration, response variability), resource utilisation (mail-outs) and ethical considerations (acceptability). Results From October 2016 to February 2017, an eligible musculoskeletal Read code was entered on 343 occasions, 202 patients were excluded (declined, n=153; screened not suitable, n=49) at the point of consultation. The remaining 141 patients were mailed an invitation to participate (41.1%); 46 patients responded to the invitation (response rate: 32.6%), of which 27 patients consented (consent rate: 19.1%). Participants mean age was 13.7 years (SD 2.7) and current pain intensity was 2.8 (SD 2.7). All participants completed the 6-week follow-up questionnaire. All participants found the interview questions to be acceptable and would consider participating in a similar study in the future. The majority of general practitioners/nurse practitioners, and all of the research nurses reported to be adequately informed about the study and found the study processes acceptable. Conclusion The expected number of participants were identified and invited, but consent rate was low (<20%) indicating that this method is not feasible (eg, for use in a large prospective study).

Whilst the frequency of occurrence of this hazard, mainly from pluvial events, is of fundamental importance in climate change and earth sciences research, the severity of its impacts motivates major debates within the context of flood risk management and sustainable urban development. The present study focuses on the development of a novel flood model, as a contribution to meeting the challenges of flood risk assessment within data poor urban areas such as in Nigeria. The new model combines the full functionality of cellular automata (CA) framework with a semi-implicit finite difference numerical scheme (SIFDS), whilst the resulting algorithms were programmed within MATLAB (TM) programming platform. In this study, computation complexity and distributed topographic data requirement, both which are associated with flood modelling, and which tend to present a major limitation to flood modelling in the developing countries (DCs) are being addressed. A highly urbanized area within the Lagos metropolis of Nigeria was chosen as a case study to validate the model and to simulate the July 10th 2011 flooding event. A 2-m horizontal resolution LiDAR DEM, published Manning's friction coefficients and rainfall intensity, were used as data inputs into the new flood model. Simulated results compared well with actual flooding inundations, reported by urban residents, and detailed in some literature and by the media. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between predicted flood depth and estimated values is 0.968. It is expected that the challenges of urban flooding in Lagos particularly and in the DCs generally will be better addressed if robust, but low-cost flood models are developed and utilized in the assessment of flood damage.",,,,,,"Nkwunonwo, Ugonna/0000-0002-6944-0675",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-343X,1879-1956,,,,FEB,2019,150,,,,,,272,281,,10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.10.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.10.016,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000460195100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is understudied among adolescents, despite increasing internalizing and decreasing externalizing symptoms in recent years. Methods We analyzed data from US Monitoring the Future cross-sectional surveys (1991-2018) representative of school-attending adolescents (N = 304,542). Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood estimation method and promax rotation resulted in a two-factor solution (factor correlation r = 0.24) that differentiated eight internalizing and seven conduct-related externalizing symptoms. Time-varying effect modification linear regression models estimated the association between standardized internalizing and externalizing symptoms factor scores over time overall and by gender. Results In 2012, trends in average factor scores diverged for internalizing and externalizing factors. The average standardized internalizing factor score increased from - 0.03 in 2012 to 0.06 in 2013 and the average externalizing factor score decreased from - 0.06 in 2011 to - 0.13 in 2012. We found that for every one-unit increase in standardized internalizing factor score, standardized externalizing factor score increased by 0.224 units in 2010 (95% CI: 0.215, 0.233); the magnitude of this increase was 22.3% lower in 2018 (i.e., 0.174 units; 95% CI: 0.160, 0.188). Decoupling of internalizing and externalizing symptoms began earlier among boys (similar to 1995) than among girls (similar to 2010).

Practical and sound advice relies on knowledge of the resident parasite species, the anthelmintic resistance status of important species, and the strategies currently being utilised by owners and managers of horses. Much of this farm-level information is lacking in the Australian literature. Aims The present study aimed to gather both farm- and horse-level prevalence data for four important equine helminth species and to gather information on the current worm-management practices conducted on Australian horse farms. Methods We conducted a coprological survey of cyathostomins,Strongylus vulgaris,Parascarisspp. and equine tapeworm on 102 horse properties, using a combination of classical and molecular parasitological methods, including a tapeworm polymerase chain reaction developed as part of the study. A questionnaire canvasing horse owners on internal parasite-control practices was also distributed. Key results Cyathostomin were present on all farms surveyed andS. vulgaris, despite being considered rare, was present on 7.8% (95% CI: 3.9-15.0) of farms. The prevalence ofParascarisspp. and equine tapeworm was 33.3% (95% CI: 19.6-50.6) and 3.9% (95% CI: 1.5-10.1) respectively. Questionnaire responses showed that the majority (85.0%) of horse owners administer anthelmintics at regular intervals of 12 weeks or less, and only 2.6% utilise faecal egg counts to inform treatment decisions. Conclusions Prevalence data confirmed the endemic nature of cyathostomin andP. equoruminfections, as well as low levels of tapeworm andS. vulgarisinfections on Australian horse farms. Worm-management practices were reminiscent of traditional interval-style treatment regimens that rely heavily on macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics.

During periods of crisis, anchor institutions may exert leadership by issuing pub-lic statements to communicate shared institutional values, enhance morale, and signal direction in the face of crisis. In our analysis of public statements issued by 56 leading U.S. medical schools, we found that nearly all identified George Floyd by name, and a majority noted the role of racism or acknowledged the Black community specifically. Fewer referenced the act resulting in Floyd's death or made explicit reference to the police. Far fewer explicitly used terms denoting active support, like antiracism or Black Lives Matter. Only a minority of institutions made reference to the killing of George Floyd by the police, and most failed to address this country's targeted, historically engrained, and sustained oppression of Black people through white supremacy. Thus, there remain significant opportunities for U.S. medical schools to exert meaningful leadership in public health. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We characterized the performance of single- and multi-SNP models for identifying causal genes in GWAS data for 46 circulating metabolites. We show that: (A) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression than did the top cis-eQTL (median 2-fold improvement); (B) predicted expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (false discovery rate < 0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite pairs, but, after stepwise conditional analyses, 90% were dominated by a single eQTL SNP; (C) among the 35% of associations where a SNP in the expression model was a significant cis-eQTL and metabolomic-QTL (met-QTL), 92% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in multi-SNP models; and (D) using a truth'' set of causal genes at 61 met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67%), but the positive predictive value was low, as only 8% of TWAS associations (19% when restricted to colocalized associations at met-QTLs) involved true causal genes.

However, evidence from large population-based studies examining whether cancer and cancer-related therapy exacerbates the risk of COVID-19 infection is still limited. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 29 through May 8, 2020. Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared with participants without cancer, those living with cancer had a 60% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test. Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of a positive test. The association between cancer and COVID-19 infection was stronger among participants >65 years and males. Future studies are needed to identify subgroups by tumor types and treatment regimens who are particularly at risk for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes.",,,,,"Lo, Chun-Han/AAT-4992-2020; Visconti, Alessia/B-9974-2015; Varsavsky, Thomas/AAU-7605-2021; Guo, Chuan-Guo/GWU-8356-2022; l, H/HJA-6959-2022; Sudre, Carole H./AAX-6672-2020; Menni, Cristina/JLL-2864-2023; Kwon, Sohee/HTL-8296-2023; Cardoso, Maria/JIH-3240-2023; Freydin, Maxim/A-5603-2011; Fall, Tove/O-7226-2014; Cardoso, M.

Objective: We aimed to estimate changes in median daily travel distance of our cohort from their registered addresses before and after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: Participants were recruited into Virus Watch starting in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants, and vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onward. Between September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch participants to contribute toward our tracker subcohort, which uses the GPS via a smartphone app to collect data on movement. We used segmented linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Results: We analyzed the daily travel distance of 249 vaccinated adults. From 157 days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median daily travel distance was 9.05 (IQR 8.06-10.09) km. From the day of vaccination to 105 days after vaccination, the median daily travel distance was 10.08 (IQR 8.60-12.42) km. From 157 days prior to vaccination until the vaccination date, there was a daily median decrease in mobility of 40.09 m (95% CI -50.08 to -31.10; P<.001). After vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of 60.60 m (95% CI 20.90-100; P<.001). Restricting the analysis to the third national lockdown (January 4, 2021, to April 5, 2021), we found a median daily movement increase of 18.30 m (95% CI -19.20 to 55.80; P=.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and a median daily movement increase of 9.36 m (95% CI 38.6-149.00; P=.69) in the 30 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting high-volume geolocation data as part of research projects and the utility of these data for understanding public health issues. Our various analyses produced results that ranged from no change in movement after vaccination (during the third national lock down) to an increase in movement after vaccination (considering all periods, up to 105 days after vaccination), suggesting that, among Virus Watch participants, any changes in movement distances after vaccination are small. Our findings may be attributable to public health measures in place at the time such as movement restrictions and home working that applied to the Virus Watch cohort participants during the study period.",,,,,"Hayward, Andrew C/C-3268-2013; Shrotri, Madhumita/ABG-2607-2020; Geismar, Cyril/GOH-0857-2022","Shrotri, Madhumita/0000-0001-9791-122X; Geismar, Cyril/0000-0002-8486-5890; Liu, Yunzhe/0000-0002-7189-3323; Patel, Parth/0000-0001-5207-2776; Flanagan, Benjamin/0000-0002-3516-8212; Braithwaite, Isobel/0000-0001-5327-5612; Aldridge, Robert/0000-0003-0542-0816; Byrne, Thomas/0000-0001-8667-0870; Beale, Sarah/0000-0002-4038-7460; Kovar, Jana/0000-0002-0477-2767; Fong, Wing Lam Erica/0000-0001-5097-2228; Fragaszy, Ellen/0000-0002-0178-6098; Cheng, Tao/0000-0002-5503-9813; Nguyen, Vincent/0000-0002-9776-6242; Aryee, Anna/0000-0001-9537-8011; Navaratnam, Annalan/0000-0002-8141-5923",,,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,,2023,9,,,,,,,,,10.2196/38072,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/38072,,,,,,,,36884272,,,,,WOS:000976765100009,View Full Record in Web of Science
