TI  - A Social Media Campaign (#datasaveslives) to Promote the Benefits of Using Health Data for Research Purposes: Mixed Methods Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public. However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research.
   Objective: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield.
   Methods: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users.
   Results: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing.
   Conclusions: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.

AB  - This study addresses ethical questions about conducting health science research using network data from social media platforms. We provide examples of ethically problematic areas related to participant consent, expectation of privacy, and social media networks. Further, to illustrate how researchers can maintain ethical integrity while leveraging social media networks, we describe a study that demonstrates the ability to use social media to identify individuals affected by cancer. We discuss best practices and ethical guidelines for studying social media network data, including data collection, analysis, and reporting.

TI  - Application of the Social Network Analysis to Better Comprehend Relationships in Qualitative Health Data
T2  - CONNECTING THE SYSTEM TO ENHANCE THE PRACTITIONER AND CONSUMER EXPERIENCE IN HEALTHCARE
CP  - 26th Australian National Health Informatics Conference (HIC)
AB  - Objective: To explore social network analysis (SNA) as an additional approach to elucidate quantifiable insight from qualitative health-related textual data. Methods: Key concepts gained from thematic analyses of a set of qualitative health data obtained from an implementation study was analysed using the Excel Add-on module NodeXL Results: Our results show that SNA provided useful visualisation and quantifiable information of the relationship between key concepts obtained from the thematic analysis. Discussion: SNA is a useful technique for exploring and analysing qualitative data, particularly when the research interest is in complex relationships that may exist among a large number of qualitative variables. In addition to providing a way to visualise the relationship between concepts, SNA provides metric measures that can be further analysed quantitatively. Conclusion: The SNA approach allows researchers to explore deeper relationships that may exist among various variables and enable researchers to derive potentially a fuller and more complete appreciation and comprehension of health-related data.

T2  - COMPANION OF THE 11TH ACM CONFERENCE ON WEB SCIENCE (WEBSCI' 19)
CP  - 11th ACM Conference on Web Science (WebSci)
AB  - Text, images, geotags and other data from social media sites lend researchers a unique window into population health trends and disease spread. While these data provide the opportunity to track and measure health outcomes across geographic regions, over extended periods of time, and through complex social networks, they also present challenges. Most notably, these data carry significant biases due to demographic differences in who chooses to use each platform, and what they choose to share. While several publications have discussed the limitations of leveraging social media data for public health research, the amount of literature systematically investigating their demographic bias and exploring mitigation strategies is limited and ripe for interdisciplinary contributions. In this discussion paper, we highlight that understanding the strengths and limitations of these data sources would enable a rigorous assessment of their usefulness for public health research and provide a means for quantifying uncertainty in research findings.

TI  - SocInf: Membership Inference Attacks on Social Media Health Data With Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Social media networks have shown rapid growth in the past, and massive social data are generated which can reveal behavior or emotion propensities of users. Numerous social researchers leverage machine learning technology to build social media analytic models which can detect the abnormal behaviors or mental illnesses from the social media data effectively. Although the researchers only public the prediction interfaces of the machine learning models, in general, these interfaces may leak information about the individual data records on which the models were trained. Knowing a certain user's social media record was used to train a model can breach user privacy. In this paper, we present SocInf and focus on the fundamental problem known as membership inference. The key idea of SocInf is to construct a mimic model which has a similar prediction behavior with the public model, and then we can disclose the prediction differences between the training and testing data set by abusing the mimic model. With elaborated analytics on the predictions of the mimic model, SocInf can thus infer whether a given record is in the victim model's training set or not. We empirically evaluate the attack performance of SocInf on machine learning models trained by Xgboost, logistics, and online cloud platform. Using the realistic data, the experiment results show that SocInf can achieve an inference accuracy and precision of 73% and 84%, respectively, in average, and of 83% and 91% at best.

CP  - IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT)
AB  - Various events and their perspectives around the world are discussed or posted at every moment on social media platforms like Twitter in near real-time, forming an enriched repository of information as historical records or time series. These include people's sentiments, emotions, opinions, and other information such as situational aspects of the spreading of a particular disease, ailment, or a population explosion of some vectors or pathogens. Exploring and harnessing such information about a disease for surveillance to prevent and control its spreading or becoming epidemic or pandemic is worthwhile for a country or the world. In this paper, we correlate tweeting activity with the reported disease cases, and take advantage of the predictive power of neural networks and auto-regressive models to estimate disease incidences for the current week (aka nowcasting) considering the social media data and the disease case counts reported by the Government agencies. We propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network models and autoregressive moving average models with two channels of inputs to incorporate social media and historic disease case count data for predicting current disease case counts. We employ various LSTM network models and autoregressive moving average models to estimate the current week's disease case count and compared their performance considering tweets as exogenous input to these models. The experimental results establish the efficacy of the LSTM network models with dynamically merged inputs for predicting disease case count with least prediction error.

TI  - Emulating a virtual digital cohort study based on social media data as a complementary approach to traditional epidemiology: When, what for, and how?
T2  - DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - With an unprecedented volume of data generated online by individuals, it becomes more and more relevant to analyze them for health-related purposes. However, the field of digital epidemiology lacks standardization which prevents it from moving away from a reproducibility crisis. In this article, we introduce the concept of a virtual digital cohort study (VDCS), a standardized method that can mimic an actual cohort study design exclusively thanks to social media data. We draw parallels between principles in epidemiology and their adaptations for a VDCS, and we use two diabetes-related examples to illustrate how a VDCS can help address some research questions. We also argue that developing a VDCS is a valid alternative to a costly, real-life, cohort implementation for some but not all research questions. We provide guidelines and recommendations to future researchers willing to launch a VDCS and, finally, we demonstrate why combining both a virtual and a real-life cohort study, sequentially or in parallel, can help conduct more relevant, patient-centric, research.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - A survey of social media data analysis for physical activity surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
AB  - Social media data can provide valuable information regarding people's behaviors and health outcomes. Previous studies have shown that social media data can be extracted to monitor and predict infectious disease outbreaks. These same approaches can be applied to other fields including physical activity research and forensic science. Social media data have the potential to provide real-time monitoring and prediction of physical activity level in a given region. This tool can be valuable to public health organizations as it can overcome the time lag in the reporting of physical activity epidemiology data faced by traditional research methods (e.g. surveys, observational studies). As a result, this tool could help public health organizations better mobilize and target physical activity interventions. The first part of this paper aims to describe current approaches (e.g. topic modeling, sentiment analysis and social network analysis) that could be used to analyze social media data to provide real-time monitoring of physical activity level. The second aim of this paper was to discuss ways to apply social media analysis to other fields such as forensic sciences and provide recommendations to further social media research.

TI  - Social Media and Suicide: A Review of Technology-Based Epidemiology and Risk Assessment
T2  - TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH
AB  - Introduction:Suicide is a significant public health problem among teenagers and young adults in the United States, placing significant stress on emergency departments (EDs) to effectively screen and assess for the presence of suicidality in a rapid yet efficient manner.Methods:A literature search was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE with the following terms: Social media, Suicide, Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Snapchat, Ethics, Digital Media, and Forums and Blog. Data were extracted from each article, specifically the sample size, study setting, and design. Only English-language studies were included. We reviewed the reference lists of included articles for additional studies, as well. Abstracts, unpublished data, and duplicate articles were excluded.Results:A total of 363 articles met our initial criteria. Studies older than 10 years and/or in a language other than English were removed. After review, a total of 31 peer-reviewed articles were included in the study. Teenagers and young adults often fail to disclose risk factors to physicians, despite sharing them with the public on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, physician access to a patient's social media can assist in identifying suicidal ideation and/or acts.Conclusions:Viewing a patient's social media accounts can help ED physicians gain perspective into his or her mental health status and identify those at risk for suicide; however, ethical and privacy concerns associated with this method of data gathering make implementation of such a practice controversial. To justify its use, formal prospective studies analyzing if and how physician access to a patient's social media influences care should be performed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Social media is an undeniable reality in our lives. The professional use of social media is increasing with every passing day. It has provided new avenues of service delivery in individual and hospital practices. But the operational structure of most social media platforms can create problems for its professional use in healthcare, as the controls that exists in physical environment under regulatory frameworks, aren't available there. Indeed, it's a daunting task to maintain, for example, confidentiality and ownership of health data, which once shared stays forever in cyberspace. Healthcare providers especially Physicians and all other stakeholders should focus on this changing face of healthcare and try to develop guidelines which can lessen fears, promote optimal use, and can help maintain ethos of practice of medicine on social media.

TI  - Detecting Suicide Ideation in the Era of Social Media: The Population Neuroscience Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Social media platforms are increasingly used across many population groups not only to communicate and consume information, but also to express symptoms of psychological distress and suicidal thoughts. The detection of suicidal ideation (SI) can contribute to suicide prevention. Twitter data suggesting SI have been associated with negative emotions (e.g., shame, sadness) and a number of geographical and ecological variables (e.g., geographic location, environmental stress). Other important research contributions on SI come from studies in neuroscience. To date, very few research studies have been conducted that combine different disciplines (epidemiology, health geography, neurosciences, psychology, and social media big data science), to build innovative research directions on this topic. This article aims to offer a new interdisciplinary perspective, that is, a Population Neuroscience perspective on SI in order to highlight new ways in which multiple scientific fields interact to successfully investigate emotions and stress in social media to detect SI in the population. We argue that a Population Neuroscience perspective may help to better understand the mechanisms underpinning SI and to promote more effective strategies to prevent suicide timely and at scale.

TI  - Social network analysis of COVID-19 transmission in Karnataka, India
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to assess the potential of SNA as a tool for outbreak monitoring and control. We analysed contact tracing data of 1147 COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11-40, 742 males), anonymised and made public by the Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree was 1-47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four (2.96%) 'super-spreaders' (outdegree > 5) caused 60% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.

TI  - Social Media Addiction among Vietnam Youths: Patterns and Correlated Factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Prior research has investigated how the excessive use of social media has an impact on one's functioning. Youths are among the most vulnerable subjects to the impacts of social media overuse, especially in Vietnam (a developing country). However, very little evidence has been provided on social media addiction. This work aims to determine the prevalence of social media addiction amongst Vietnamese individuals and the factors associated with social media addiction. Method: An online cross-sectional study was conducted from June to July 2020 in Vietnam. Participants completed the structured questionnaire, which comprised four main components: (1) social characteristics; (2) The Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale; (3) stress associated with neglect and negative reactions by online peers and fear of missing out (FOMO); and (4) status of social media platform usage. Results: Some demographic factors, such as gender, the locality of accommodation, and relationship status affected the overall scores. The results also indicated Facebook, Zalo, and Youtube to be the most popular social media platforms among Vietnamese youths. Individuals who used social media for gaming also had higher BSMAS scores. FOMO and stress associated with neglect by online peers had a high correlation with social media addiction. Conclusions: This study is one of the first studies to examine social media addiction and its associated factors in Vietnam. Interventions for social media addiction need to be developed in different fields: clinical research, policy, and education.

TI  - Palestinian Social Media and Lone-Wolf Attacks: Subculture, Legitimization, and Epidemic
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB  - This article examines the impact of social media on the wave of Palestinian lone-wolf attacks against Israelis from October 2015 through September 2016. My principal argument is that social media played an important role in shaping the identity, perceptions, and behavioral patterns of dozens of assailants, and was key in creating the dynamic that ultimately characterized both the spreading of the idea of lone-wolf attacks and its execution. Social media reflected reality on the ground while simultaneously nourishing, amplifying, and escalating the situation by providing a platform for the emergence of new sources of authority, including an online subculture with distinct codes and pseudo-ritual patterns to support assailants. Social media also contributed substantially to shaping the contagious character of the attacks, and their capacity to persist without direct organizational guidance, following a typical epidemiological dynamic of spread, containment, and preservation.

T2  - MEDICINE AND LAW
AB  - Social media is becoming more determinative in the patient-physician relationship, with legal or social consequences. The aim is to reveal medical students' perceptions of sharing health data and its effect on the patient-physician relationship. Methodology: An online survey of 15 questions evaluating demographic data, attitude toward using social media, perceptions on sharing personal private health data, and influence of social media on the patient-physician relationship was designed. Results: Females (67.05%) were significantly more comfortable with sharing medical information/images on social media than males. While 43.80% of participants considered real-life patient-physician friendship acceptable, 37.59% thought it was acceptable to be virtual friends with their physicians, and only 27.14% would accept friend requests from their patients. Students thought their physician's social media posts would not affect their trust (48.84%) and respect (49.22%) for their physician, and 47.29% thought physician's posts on social media would make them feel closer to her. Finally, 64.34% thought that learning more about patients via social media posts would not impact their attitude toward these patients. Discussion: Evaluating the medical students' perceptions of the issue will shape the structure of their medical education proactively and shed a light to their professional lives mainly with an ethical perspective.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - The digital world in which we live is changing rapidly. The evolving media environment is having a direct impact on traditional forms of communication and knowledge translation in public health and epidemiology. Openly accessible digital media can be used to reach a broader and more diverse audience of trainees, scientists, and the lay public than can traditional forms of scientific communication. The new digital landscape for delivering content is vast, and new platforms are continuously being added. In this article, we focus on several, including Twitter and podcasting, and discuss their relevance to epidemiology and science communication. We highlight 3 key reasons why we think epidemiologists should be engaging with these mediums: 1) science communication, 2) career advancement, and 3) development of a community and public service. Other positive and negative consequences of engaging in these forms of new media are also discussed. The authors of this commentary are all engaged in social media and podcasting for scientific communication, and we reflect on our experiences with these mediums as tools to advance the field of epidemiology.

CP  - 19th IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)
AB  - Social media are increasingly used to collect data and report on the personal health status, on health issues, symptoms and experiences with treatments. The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making.
   Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients' health issues more efficiently.

AB  - Purpose: To better understand the benefits and harms of engagement with online pediatric liver disease communities within social media.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of caregivers of children with liver disease participating in online pediatric liver disease communities within social media, as well as a survey of healthcare providers (e.g., physicians, surgeons, nurse coordinators) from this field to better understand the perceived benefits and harms of participation.
   Results: Among 138 caregivers of children with liver disease that completed the survey, 97.8% agreed social media was a good place to learn about patient experiences and 88% agreed it was a good source of general information. Among caregivers, 84.8% agreed social media helps them to better advocate for their child. While 18% agreed that the information over social media was equal to the information from their healthcare team and 19% neither agreed/disagreed, only 3% indicated they would use this information to change care without telling their provider; in contrast, among 217 healthcare providers, 55% believed social media may lead caregivers to change management without telling their team.
   Conclusion: Engagement with online disease-specific communities in social media yields several benefits for caregivers and, in contrast to healthcare providers' concerns, participation is unlikely to lead to problems including caregivers changing the treatment plan without first discussing these plans with their team. Openness between caregivers and medical teams about the role for social media can help to improve trust and maximize the potential benefits of engagement with these groups.

TI  - Horizontal disease transmission in lions from behavioural interfaces via social network analysis
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
AB  - The degree of relatedness and an interacting unifying central member can exacerbate disease transmission within a social group. The severity of the disease depends on the route, dose and frequency of infection. Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the spread of the disease. LionsPanthera leoare social carnivores with individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other, a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so, within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear from a pride. Persistence of the disease as noted for lions in Kruger can only realize through unlikely transmissions or through feeding on infected prey. Our results support lions as a spill-over host.

TI  - Incorporating patient generated health data into pharmacoepidemiological research
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
AB  - Epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology frequently employ Real-World Data (RWD) from healthcare teams to inform research. These data sources usually include signs, symptoms, tests, and treatments, but may lack important information such as the patient's diet or adherence or quality of life. By harnessing digital tools a new fount of evidence, Patient (or Citizen/Person) Generated Health Data (PGHD), is becoming more readily available. This review focusses on the advantages and considerations in using PGHD for pharmacoepidemiological research. New and corroborative types of data can be collected directly from patients using digital devices, both passively and actively. Practical issues such as patient engagement, data linking, validation, and analysis are among important considerations in the use of PGHD. In our ever increasingly patient-centric world, PGHD incorporated into more traditional Real-Word data sources offers innovative opportunities to expand our understanding of the complex factors involved in health and the safety and effectiveness of disease treatments. Pharmacoepidemiologists have a unique role in realizing the potential of PGHD by ensuring that robust methodology, governance, and analytical techniques underpin its use to generate meaningful research results.

TI  - Non-Communicable Diseases and Social Media: A Heart Disease Symptoms Application
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Social media platforms have become ubiquitous and allow users to share information in real-time. Our study uses data analytics as an approach to explore non-communicable diseases on social media platforms and to identify trends and patterns of related disease symptoms. Exploring epidemiological patterns of non-communicable diseases is vital given that they have become prevalent in low-income communities, accounting for about 38 million deaths worldwide. We collected data related to multiple disease conditions from the Twitter microblogging platform and zoomed into symptoms related to heart diseases. As part of our analyses, we focussed on the mechanism and trends of disease occurrences. Our results show that specific symptoms may be attributed to multiple disease conditions and it is viable to identify trends and patterns of their occurrences using a structured analytics approach. This can then act as a supplementary tool to support epidemiological initiatives that monitor non-communicable diseases. Based on the study's results, we identify that non-communicable disease surveillance approach using social media analytics could support the design of effective health intervention strategies.

TI  - Health Monitoring on Social Media over Time
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB  - Social media has become a major source for analyzing all aspects of daily life. Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to monitor people's health over time. The use of tweets has several benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost. Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems: health transition detection and health transition prediction. We first propose the Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model (TM-ATAM), a new latent model dedicated to solving the first problem by capturing transitions that involve health-related topics. TM-ATAM is a non-obvious extension to ATAM that was designed to extract health-related topics. It learns health-related topic transitions by minimizing the prediction error on topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and geographic granularities. To solve the second problem, we develop T-ATAM, a Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect Model where time is treated as a random variable natively inside ATAM. Our experiments on an 8-month corpus of tweets show that TM-ATAM outperforms TM-LDA in estimating health-related transitions from tweets for different geographic populations. We examine the ability of TM-ATAM to detect transitions due to climate conditions in different geographic regions. We then show how T-ATAM can be used to predict the most important transition and additionally compare T-ATAM with CDC (Center for Disease Control) data and Google Flu Trends.

TI  - Epicosm-a framework for linking online social media in epidemiological cohorts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - MotivationSocial media represent an unrivalled opportunity for epidemiological cohorts to collect large amounts of high-resolution time course data on mental health. Equally, the high-quality data held by epidemiological cohorts could greatly benefit social media research as a source of ground truth for validating digital phenotyping algorithms. However, there is currently a lack of software for doing this in a secure and acceptable manner. We worked with cohort leaders and participants to co-design an open-source, robust and expandable software framework for gathering social media data in epidemiological cohorts.Implementation Epicosm is implemented as a Python framework that is straightforward to deploy and run inside a cohort's data safe haven.General features The software regularly gathers Tweets from a list of accounts and stores them in a database for linking to existing cohort data.

TI  - Social Media Terms and Conditions and Informed Consent From Children: Ethical Analysis
T2  - JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING
AB  - Background: Terms and conditions define the relationship between social media companies and users. However, these legal agreements are long and written in a complex language. It remains questionable whether users understand the terms and conditions and are aware of the consequences of joining such a network. With children from a young age interacting with social media, companies are acquiring large amounts of data, resulting in longitudinal data sets that most researchers can only dream of. The use of social media by children is highly relevant to their mental and physical health for 2 reasons: their health can be adversely affected by social media and their data can be used to conduct health research.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to offer an ethical analysis of how the most common social media apps and services inform users and obtain their consent regarding privacy and other issues and to discuss how lessons from research ethics can lead to trusted partnerships between users and social media companies. Our paper focuses on children, who represent a sensitive group among users of social media platforms.
   Methods: A thematic analysis of the terms and conditions of the 20 most popular social media platforms and the 2 predominant mobile phone ecosystems (Android and iOS) was conducted. The results of this analysis served as the basis for scoring these platforms.
   Results: The analysis showed that most platforms comply with the age requirements issued by legislators. However, the consent process during sign-up was not taken seriously. Terms and conditions are often too long and difficult to understand, especially for younger users. The same applies to age verification, which is not realized proactively but instead relies on other users who report underaged users.
   Conclusions: This study reveals that social media networks are still lacking in many respects regarding the adequate protection of children. Consent procedures are flawed because they are too complex, and in some cases, children can create social media accounts without sufficient age verification or parental oversight. Adopting measures based on key ethical principles will safeguard the health and well-being of children. This could mean standardizing the registration process in accordance with modern research ethics procedures: give users the key facts that they need in a format that can be read easily and quickly, rather than forcing them to wade through chapters of legal language that they cannot understand. Improving these processes would help safeguard the mental health of children and other social media users.

TI  - Prediction of vaccine hesitancy based on social media traffic among Israeli parents using machine learning strategies
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction Vaccines have contributed to substantial reductions of morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases, mainly in children. However, vaccine hesitancy was listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 as one of the top ten threats to world health. Aim To employ machine-learning strategies to assess how on-line content regarding vaccination affects vaccine hesitancy. Methods We collected social media posts and responses from vaccination discussion groups and forums on leading social platforms, including Facebook and Tapuz (A user content website that contains blogs and forums). We investigated 65,603 records of children aged 0-6 years who are insured in Maccabi's Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). We applied three machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Random forest and Neural networks) to predict vaccination among Israeli children, based on demographic and social media traffic. Results Higher hesitancy was associated with more social media traffic, for most of the vaccinations. The addition of the social media traffic features improved the performances of most of the models. However, for Rota virus, Hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the performances of all algorithms (with and without the social media features) were close to random (accuracy up to 0.63 and F1 up to 0.65). We found a negative association between on-line discussions and vaccination. Conclusions There is an association between social media traffic and vaccine hesitancy. Policy makers are encouraged to perceive social media as a main channel of communication during health crises. Health officials and experts are encouraged to take part in social media discussions, and be equipped to readily provide the information, support and advice that the public is looking for, in order to optimize vaccination actions and to improve public health

TI  - Real-world data and the patient perspective: the PROmise of social media?
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
AB  - Understanding the patient perspective is fundamental to delivering patient-centred care. In most healthcare systems, however, patient-reported outcomes are not regularly collected or recorded as part of routine clinical care, despite evidence that doing so can have tangible clinical benefit. In the absence of the routine collection of these data, research is beginning to turn to social media as a novel means to capture the patient voice. Publicly available social media data can now be analysed with relative ease, bypassing many logistical hurdles associated with traditional approaches and allowing for accelerated and cost-effective data collection. Existing work has shown these data can offer credible insight into the patient experience, although more work is needed to understand limitations with respect to patient representativeness and nuances of captured experience. Nevertheless, linking social media to electronic medical records offers a significant opportunity for patient views to be systematically collected for health services research and ultimately to improve patient care.

TI  - Impact of Social Media on Obesity Awareness in Jeddah City: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Obesity awareness depends foremost on social media, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. Persons share health information, regardless its accuracy. The present study first target is to investigate person's approaches to obesity health data on social media. Second, to report in what way social media influences managing our health and evaluating if persons change their medicine upon these data. A cross-sectional study was directed during February 2020 on persons living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We involved persons using WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. We prepared an electronic questionnaire for obesity awareness, including multiple-choice and closed-ended questions to specify which media is mostly used. Questionnaire responses showed that 93.9% used WhatsApp, 79.8% Facebook, and 32.3% Twitter (p=0.005). WhatsApp had the major impact regarding health & obesity awareness. Accordingly, accurate and evidence-based health awareness via digital era is necessary.

TI  - Social Network Analysis of Patient Movement Across Health Care Entities in Orange County, Florida
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
AB  - Objective Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are continually emerging and threatening health care systems. Little attention has been paid to the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which include metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals. Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt MDRO transmission across a health care network.

TI  - Enjoyment or Indulgence? Social Media Service Usage, Social Gratification, Self-Control Failure and Emotional Health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Social networking site smartphone applications have been widely used among Chinese young adults. However, less is known about their effects on emotional health and the mechanisms through which they function. This study analyzes the relationship between college students' smartphone social networking service use patterns, social gratification, social media self-control failure, and emotional health. Data was collected from 360 college students in China via application log tracking and a self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling results showed that, after controlling for demographic variables, the use of video social networking site smartphone applications was associated with decreased social gratification, and ultimately, adverse emotional health. Using social networking site smartphone applications late at night exhibited worse emotional health via more social media self-control failure. The implications for designing and using social media applications are discussed.

TI  - Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing in a cohort study to investigate TB transmission in an educational setting
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: TB outbreaks in educational institutions can result in significant transmission and pose a considerable threat to TB control. Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak in an educational setting.
   Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection. Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M. tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated with case status and risk communities.
   Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7% positivity rate) and nine active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was 39.1% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious case (odds ratio 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The community structure analysis divided the students into five communities based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social network analysis identified that the community including the suspected index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds ratio 7.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single SNP difference.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological approaches to direct public health action in this setting.

TI  - A few panel members dominated guideline development meeting discussions: Social network analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To identify patterns of interactions that may influence guideline panels' decision-making. Study Design and Setting: Social network analysis (SNA) to describe the conversation network in a guideline development meeting in United States. Results: We analyzed one two-day guideline panel meeting that included 20 members who developed a guideline using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The conversation pattern of the guideline panel indicated a well-connected network (density = 0.59, clustering coefficient = 0.82). GRADE topics on quality of evidence and benefits versus harms accounted for 46%; non-GRADE factors accounted for 30% of discussion. The chair, co-chair and methodologist initiated 53% and received 60% of all communications in the meeting; 42% of their communications occurred among themselves. SNA metrics (eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) indicated that these individuals also exerted highest influence on discussion, controlled information flow and were at the center of all communications. Members were more likely to continue previous discussion with the same individuals after both morning breaks (r = 0.54, P < 0.005; r = 0.17, P = 0.04), and after the last break on day 2 ( r = 0.44, P = 0.015). Conclusion: Non-GRADE factors such as breaks, and the members' roles, affect guideline development more than previously recognized. Collectively, the chair, co-chair and methodologist dominated the discussion. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Social media partnerships with patient organizations for neuro-oncology patient recruitment
T2  - NEURO-ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
AB  - Background. In neuro-oncology, traditional-methods of enrolling the large numbers of participants required or studies of disease etiology and treatment response are costly, labor intensive, and may not include patients in regions without tumor registries.
   Methods. In the Yale Acoustic Neuroma (AN) Study and International Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) Registry, we partenered with several brain tumor patient organizations to develop social media enrollment campaigns arid use web-based data collection resources at the Yale University School of Public Health to test alternative methods to enroll neuro-oncology patients for epidemiologic study.
   Results. In the AN study, we enrolled 1024 patients overt years h s , 865 patients completed the online questionnaire, 697 returned written consent, 583 sent a pathology report, and 569 returned a saliva specimen. The completed 569 participants did not differ by age or treatment from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data but were more likely to be female (67% vs 52%) and white 04.8% vs 84%). Patients learned of the study through the Acoustic Neuroma Association (ANA) website (61.3%), ANA support group members (18%), and social media {primarily Facebook). Costs per patient enrolled were approximately 10% to 20% that of traditional registry-based enrollment methods. Results for the LGG study were similar.
   Conclusions. Although additional effort will be required to ensure a diverse participant population, partnership with established patient organizations along with use of web-based technology and social media allowed for the successful enrollment of neuro-oncology patients a n of the cost relative to traditional methods.

We explored age, gender, and cross-national differences in adolescents' engagement in SMU, then relationships between SMU and victimization and the perpetration of cyber-bullying.
   Methods: We used data on young people aged 11-15 years (weighted n = 180,919 in 42 countries) who participated in the 2017-2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study to describe engagement in the three types of SMU (intense, problematic, and talking with strangers online) by age and gender and then in the perpetration and victimization of cyber-bullying. Relationships between SMU and cyber-bullying outcomes were estimated using Poisson regression (weighted n = 166,647 from 42 countries).
   Results: Variations in SMU and cyber-bullying follow developmental and gender-based patterns across countries. In pooled analyses, engagement in SMU related to cyber-bullying victimization (adjusted relative risks = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.19] to 1.48 [95% CI: 1.42-1.55]) and perpetration (adjusted relative risk = 1.31 [95% CI: 1.26-1.36] to 1.84 [95% CI: 1.74-1.95]). These associations were stronger for cyber-perpetration versus cyber-victimization and for girls versus boys. Problematic SMU was most strongly and consistently associated with cyber-bullying, both for victimization and perpetration. Stratified analyses showed that SMU related to cyber-victimization in 19%-45% of countries and to cyber-perpetration in 38%-86% of countries.
   Conclusions: Accessibility to social media and its pervasive use has led to new opportunities for online aggression. The time adolescents spend on social media, engage in problematic use, and talk to strangers online each relate to cyber-bullying and merit public health intervention. Problematic use of social media poses the strongest and most consistent risk. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

TI  - Analysing Social Media Forums to Discover Potential Causes of Phasic Shifts in Cryptocurrency Price Series
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN
AB  - The recent extreme volatility in cryptocurrency prices occurred in the setting of popular social media forums devoted to the discussion of cryptocurrencies. We develop a framework that discovers potential causes of phasic shifts in the price movement captured by social media discussions. This draws on principles developed in healthcare epidemiology where, similarly, only observational data are available. Such causes may have a major, one-off effect, or recurring effects on the trend in the price series. We find a one-off effect of regulatory bans on bitcoin, the repeated effects of rival innovations on ether and the influence of technical traders, captured through discussion of market price, on both cryptocurrencies. The results for Bitcoin differ from Ethereum, which is consistent with the observed differences in the timing of the highest price and the price phases. This framework could be applied to a wide range of cryptocurrency price series where there exists a relevant social media text source. Identified causes with a recurring effect may have value in predictive modelling, whilst one-off causes may provide insight into unpredictable black swan events that can have a major impact on a system.

TI  - Social media use and alcohol consumption among students in Uganda: a cross sectional study
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB  - Background Globally, alcohol use significantly contributes to the disease burden. Alcohol consumption in Uganda is related to several health consequences among young people, including university students. Social media is commonly used by students to share academic information and create social networks. Among young people in high-income countries, previous studies have also shown that social media use can have negative health outcomes related to alcohol use, and associated problems. To date, similar studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries are largely missing. Objective To assess the prevalence of and associations between social media use and alcohol consumption among university students in Uganda. Method This was a cross-sectional study among 996 undergraduate students at Makerere University. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Alcohol use in the previous 12 months was the dependent variable. The independent variable was social media use categorised as general use, alcohol-related use, and social media lurking/passive participation. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess associations. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were reported. Results Nearly all students (97%) used social media and 39% reported alcohol use. Regular alcohol use was significantly associated with moderate (OR = 2.22, CI: 1.35-3.66) and high level general social media use (OR = 2.45, CI: 1.43-4.20). Regular alcohol use was also associated with alcohol-related social media (OR = 6.46, CI: 4.04-10.30), and alcohol-related lurking (OR = 4.59, CI: 2.84-7.39). Similar, although weaker associations were identified for occasional alcohol use. Conclusions Approximately four in ten students reported alcohol use in the past year, and almost all students used social media. Alcohol-related social media use was associated with occasional and regular alcohol use, with stronger associations for regular use. These findings may guide further research and present an opportunity for potential alcohol control interventions to improve health among young populations in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Opioid use stigmatization and destigmatization in health professional social media
T2  - ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY
AB  - Stigmatization of opioid use constitutes a significant barrier to addressing the opioid crisis. Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p = .0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09, p = .00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.64, p = .00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

TI  - Social Media Communication and Network Correlates of HIV Infection and Transmission Risks Among Black Sexual Minority Men: Cross-sectional Digital Epidemiology Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In the United States, HIV disproportionately affects Black cisgender sexual minority men (BSMM). Although epidemiological and behavioral surveillance are integral to identifying BSMM at risk of HIV infection and transmission, overreliance on self-reported data, inability to observe social contexts, and neglect of populations with limited engagement in health care systems limits their effectiveness. Digital epidemiological approaches drawing on social media data offer an opportunity to overcome these limitations by passively observing in organic settings activities, beliefs, behaviors, and moods that indicate health risks but are otherwise challenging to capture.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether features of Facebook communication and networks were associated with biological, behavioral, and psychological indicators of HIV infection and transmission risk.
   Methods: Facebook and survey data were collected from BSMM aged 18 to 35 years living in Chicago (N=310). Participants' Facebook posts were characterized using 4 culturally tailored topic dictionaries related to aspects of HIV protection and risk among BSMM (sexual health; substance use; sex behavior; and ballroom culture, a salient subculture in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities of color). Social network methods were used to capture structural features of BSMM's Facebook friendships (centrality, brokerage, and local clustering) and Facebook group affiliations. Multivariable regressions revealed relationships between these Facebook features and 5 ground truth indicators of HIV infection and transmission risk (sexually transmitted infection incidence, condomless sex, sex drug use, biomedical prevention, and depression).
   Results: Although analysis of participants' Facebook posts revealed that HIV-related topics occupied a small portion of the total messages posted by each participant, significant associations were found between the following HIV risk indicators and Facebook features: Condomless sex, including communication about sexual health (odds ratio [OR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.29), ballroom culture (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93), and friendship centrality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92); Sex drug use, including communication about substance use (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79) and friendship centrality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) and brokerage (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99); Biomedical prevention, including communication about ballroom culture (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.71); and Depression, including communication about sexual health (beta=-0.72, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.02), ballroom culture (beta=.80, 95% CI 0.27-1.34), friendship centrality (beta=-0.90, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.21), and Facebook group affiliations (beta=.84, 95% CI 0.25-1.43). Facebook features provided no significant explanatory value for sexually transmitted infection incidence.
   Conclusions: Finding innovative strategies to detect BSMM at risk of contracting or transmitting HIV is critical to eliminating HIV disparities in this community. The findings suggest that social media data enable passive observance of social and communicative contexts that would otherwise go undetected using traditional HIV surveillance methods. As such, social media data are promising complements to more traditional data sources.

TI  - Reconstructing a COVID-19 outbreak within a religious group using social network analysis simulation in Korea
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We reconstructed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak to examine how a large cluster at a church setting spread before being detected and estimate the potential effectiveness of complying with mask-wearing guidelines rec-ommended by the government. METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A coun-terfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to develop precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster out-breaks.

TI  - Multi-Modality Behavioral Influence Analysis for Personalized Recommendations in Health Social Media Environment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Recently, health social media have engaged more and more people to share their personal feelings, opinions, and experience in the context of health informatics, which has drawn increasing attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we focus on the behavioral influence analysis based on heterogeneous health data generated in social media environments. An integrated deep neural network (DNN)-based learning model is designed to analyze and describe the latent behavioral influence hidden across multiple modalities, in which a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework is used to extract the time-series features within a certain social context. The learned features based on cross-modality influence analysis are then trained in a SoftMax classifier, which can result in a restructured representation of high-level features for online physician rating and classification in a data-driven way. Finally, two algorithms within two representative application scenarios are developed to provide patients with personalized recommendations in health social media environments. Experiments using the real world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and method.

TI  - Did You Really Just Have a Heart Attack? Towards Robust Detection of Personal Health Mentions in Social Media
T2  - WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018)
CP  - 27th World Wide Web (WWW) Conference
AB  - Millions of users share their experiences on social media sites, such as Twitter, which in turn generate valuable data for public health monitoring, digital epidemiology, and other analyses of population health at global scale. The first, critical, task for these applications is classifying whether a personal health event was mentioned, which we call the (PHM) problem. This task is challenging for many reasons, including typically short length of social media posts, inventive spelling and lexicons, and figurative language, including hyperbole using diseases like "heart attack" or "cancer" for emphasis, and not as a health self-report. This problem is even more challenging for rarely reported, or frequent but ambiguously expressed conditions, such as "stroke". To address this problem, we propose a general, robust method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that combines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based features. WESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by automatically distorting the word embedding space to most effectively detect the true health mentions. Unlike previously proposed state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning techniques, WESPAD requires relatively little training data, which makes it possible to adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We evaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection benchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions of multiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD outperforms the baselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases when the number and proportion of true health mentions in the training data is small.

TI  - The journey to overdose: Using spatial social network analysis as a novel framework to study geographic discordance in overdose deaths
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Introduction: Drug overdose deaths are often geographically discordant (the community in which the overdose death occurs is different from the community of residence). Thus, in many cases there is a journey to overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 % of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study. First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent, sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.

TI  - Measuring attitudes towards mental health using social media: investigating stigma and trivialisation
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThere are numerous campaigns targeting mental health stigma. However, evaluating how effective these are in changing perceptions is complex. Social media may be used to assess stigma levels and highlight new trends. This study uses a social media platform, Twitter, to investigate stigmatising and trivialising attitudes across a range of mental and physical health conditions.MethodsTweets (i.e. messages) associated with five mental and five physical health conditions were collected in ten 72-h windows over a 50-day period using automated software. A random selection of tweets per condition was considered for the analyses. Tweets were categorised according to their topic and presence of stigmatising and trivialising attitudes. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on all stigmatising and trivialising tweets.ResultsA total of 1,059,258 tweets were collected, and from this sample 1300 tweets per condition were randomly selected for analysis. Overall, mental health conditions were found to be more stigmatised (12.9%) and trivialised (14.3%) compared to physical conditions (8.1 and 6.8%, respectively). Amongst mental health conditions the most stigmatised condition was schizophrenia (41%) while the most trivialised was obsessive compulsive disorder (33%).ConclusionsOur findings show that mental health stigma is common on social media. Trivialisation is also common, suggesting that while society may be more open to discussing mental health problems, care should be taken to ensure this is done appropriately. This study further demonstrates the potential for social media to be used to measure the general public's attitudes towards mental health conditions.

TI  - News and social media coverage is associated with more downloads and citations of manuscripts that focus on substance use
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Background: A variety of substance use-related topics are discussed in the public discourse; however, it is unknown how public discussion of published substance-related findings relates to manuscript downloads and citations. This manuscript examines how traditional and social media coverage of published findings about substance use affects downloads and scientific citations.
   Methods: Altmetric and bibliographic information was obtained for manuscripts published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence between 2018 and 2019 (n = 943). Associations were examined between news and social media coverage (i.e., Twitter, Facebook) in relation to number of manuscript downloads and number of citations. This was done in a bivariable manner and in a multivariable manner examining correlates of being in the top 10th percentile of downloads and citations.
   Results: 73.3 % of articles were shared on Twitter, 23.6 % were shared on Facebook, and 13.9 % were covered in news sources (with 4.0 % receiving major media coverage). Epidemiology papers were among the most covered in the news, and e-cigarette review papers were among the most downloaded. News and social media coverage were positively associated with number of downloads and citations in bivariable models and with achieving the top 10 % of downloads and citations in multivariable models (ps < .001). Publishing a press release was associated with higher likelihood of receiving additional news coverage (aPR = 7.85, 95 % CI: 5.15-11.97).
   Conclusions: Traditional and social media coverage of manuscripts focusing on substance use are associated with more downloads and citations. Researchers should consider sharing findings not only to increase downloads and citations but also to educate the general public.

TI  - The Role of Social Media on the Research Productivity of Neurosurgeons During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic committees of all countries restricted face-to-face interactions. This study aimed to determine how the pandemic changed the research output for many neurosurgeons while highlighting how social media may have been used as a contactless platform to maintain research productivity during these times.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, 24-item, and non-randomized online survey was applied worldwide, and shared using social media platforms and emails. The questions mainly focused on comparing the results of the pre-pandemic period to the pandemic period (after March 2020).
   RESULTS: A total of 202 respondents from 60 different countries responded to the survey. Interest in neurosurgical education increased from 24% to 76%, while the topic of epidemiology gained interest from 28% to 72% when the pre-pandemic era was compared to the pandemic era. Preference for prospective studies decreased from 66% to 34%, while interest in retrospective studies increased from 39% to 61%. In evaluating publication types, the preference for reviews increased from 36% to 64%. Sixty-two percent of the respondents stated they had concerns over delays in individual contributions/lack of accountability. These concerns were followed by problems with theft of intellectual property/data and authorship disputes. Forty-one percent believed that the support of extra hands on a load-heavy project was the most powerful benefit of social media collaboration. Those who reported increased publications during the pandemic were also more likely to collaborate using social media (P = 0.030).
   CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, social media collaborations helped increase research output for neurosurgeons.

TI  - Social media stress and mental health: A brief report on the protective role of emotional intelligence
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Evidence on whether social media use is associated with poor mental health and stress remains mixed and controversial. It is suggested that this effect may vary according to individual differences. Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered a protective resource that can buffer the effects of stressors in certain contexts. We examine whether this protective effect extends to the experience of social media stress. 201 young adults (mean age 26.12; 83.6% female) completed measures of EI (trait; ability), social media stress (SMS), anxiety, depression and wellbeing. SMS related to poorer mental health (symptoms and wellbeing) whilst higher EI was linked to reduced levels of SMS and better mental health. Data show the relationship between SMS and depression is moderated by trait (not ability) EI, such that those with lower levels of trait EI, who experience high levels of SMS, report higher levels of depression symptoms compared to those with higher TEL Implications and directions for research are explored.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evaluation of social media as a tool for livestock disease surveillance
T2  - ONE HEALTH
AB  - Recent outbreaks of Avian Influenza across Europe have highlighted the potential for syndromic surveillance systems that consider other modes of data, namely social media. This study investigates the feasibility of using social media, primarily Twitter, to monitor illness outbreaks such as avian flu. Using temporal, geographical, and correlation analyses, we investigated the association between avian influenza tweets and officially verified cases in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022. Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate Moran's I analysis and time series analysis, were among the methodologies used. The findings show a weak, statistically insignificant rela-tionship between the number of tweets and confirmed cases in a temporal context, implying that relying simply on social media data for surveillance may be insufficient. The spatial analysis provided insights into the overlaps between confirmed cases and tweet locations, shedding light on regionally targeted interventions during out-breaks. Although social media can be useful for understanding public sentiment and concerns during outbreaks, it must be combined with traditional surveillance methods and official data sources for a more accurate and comprehensive approach. Improved data mining techniques and real-time analysis can improve outbreak detection and response even further. This study underscores the need of having a strong surveillance system in place to properly monitor and manage disease outbreaks and protect public health.

TI  - The use of social network analysis to examine the transmission of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. within a vertically integrated broiler enterprise
T2  - FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
CP  - International Symposium on Salmonella and Salmonellosis
AB  - To better understand factors influencing infectious agent dispersal within a livestock population information is needed on the nature and frequency of contacts between farm enterprises. This study uses social network analysis to describe the contact network within a vertically integrated broiler poultry enterprise to identify the potential horizontal and vertical transmission pathways for Salmonella spp. Nodes (farms, sheds, production facilities) were identified and the daily movement of commodities (eggs, birds, feed, litter) and people between nodes were extracted from routinely kept farm records. Three time periods were examined in detail, 1-and 8-and 17-weeks of the production cycle and contact networks were described for all movements, and by commodity and production type. All nodes were linked by at least one movement during the study period but network density was low indicating that all potential pathways between nodes did not exist. Salmonella spp. transmission via vertical or horizontal pathways can only occur along directed pathways when those pathways are present. Only two locations (breeder or feed nodes) were identified where the transmission of a single Salmonella spp. clone could theoretically percolate through the network to the broiler or processing nodes. Only the feed transmission pathway directly connected all parts of the network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - PrEP in India's HIV Prevention Policy in the Era of Social Media and Sex Positivity
T2  - CENTRAL ASIAN JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: The global revolution of online social media and connectivity had a tremendous effect on sexual behavior in both developed and developing countries. This global change is influencing the societal structure and existing social principles. Moreover, it has a significant impact on the epidemiology of different infectious diseases, especially HIV.
   Discussion: India is one of the most diverse democratic countries that has undergone a social-cultural transition in the last decade. However, having the second-highest HIV infection rate in the world, India does not have any other new prevention tools in their national HIV prevention strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a boon of HIV prevention widely used in different countries, is still not implemented in India. The concept of "Digital India" by the Government of India is giving wide access of internet to the people of India. Furthermore, people are exposed to social media, and that is impacting their sex seeking behavior. Interestingly, recent legal changes in India promotes sex positivity. It also calls for introspection on existing HIV preventive strategies.
   Conclusion: Given the current scenario of PrEP and other existing preventive measurements of HIV, further research is needed to determine the acceptance and efficacy of PrEP and improve engagement in care for individuals in India. Various international studies recommend effective implication of PrEP to reduce the rate and economic burden of HIV infection.

TI  - How Do General-Purpose Sentiment Analyzers Perform when Applied to Health-Related Online Social Media Data?
T2  - MEDINFO 2019: HEALTH AND WELLBEING E-NETWORKS FOR ALL
CP  - 17th World Congress of Medical and Health Informatics (MEDINFO)
AB  - Sentiment analysis has been increasingly used to analyze online social media data such as tweets and health forum posts. However, previous studies often adopted existing, general-purpose sentiment analyzers developed in non-healthcare domains, without assessing their validity and without customizing them for the specific study context. In this work, we empirically evaluated three general-purpose sentiment analyzers popularly used in previous studies (Stanford Core NLP Sentiment Analysis, TextBlob, and VADER), based on two online health datasets and a general-purpose dataset as the baseline. We illustrate that none of these general-purpose sentiment analyzers were able to produce satisfactory classifications of sentiment polarity. Further, these sentiment analyzers generated inconsistent results when applied to the same dataset, and their performance varies to a great extent across the two health datasets. Significant future work is therefore needed to develop context-specific sentiment analysis tools for analyzing online health data.

TI  - Behavioural intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccination, social media exposures and peer discussions in China
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - The study aimed to investigate behavioural intentions to receive free and self-paid COVID-19 vaccinations (BICV-F and BICV-SP) among Chinese university students if the vaccine was 80% effective with rare mild side effects, to examine their associations with social media exposures and peer discussions regarding COVID-19 vaccination, and to explore the mediational role of perceived information sufficiency about COVID-19 vaccination. An online anonymous survey (N = 6922) was conducted in November 2020 in five Chinese provinces. Logistic regression and path analysis were adopted. The prevalence of BICV-F and BICV-SP were 78.1% and 57.7%. BICV-F was positively associated with the frequencies of passive social media exposure (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.32, P < 0.001), active social media interaction (AOR = 1.13, P < 0.001) and peer discussions (AOR = 1.17, P < 0.001). Indirect effects of the three factors on BICV-F via perceived information sufficiency were all significant (P < 0.001). The direct effect of active social media interaction on BICV-F was significantly negative (P < 0.001). Similar associations/mediations were observed for BICV-SP. The COVID-19 vaccination intention of Chinese university students needs improvement. Boosting social media exposures and peer discussions may raise students' perceived information sufficiency and subsequently increase their vaccination intention. Considering the potential negative effect of active social media interaction, caution is needed when using social media to promote COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Surveying public opinion using label prediction on social media data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2019)
CP  - IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)
AB  - In this study, a procedure is proposed for surveying public opinion from big social media domain-specific textual data to minimize the difficulties associated with modeling public behavior. Strategies for labeling posts relevant to a topic are discussed. A two-part framework is proposed in which semiautomatic labeling is applied to a small subset of posts, referred to as the "seed" in further text. This seed is used as bases for semi-supervised labeling of the rest of the data. The hypothesis is that the proposed method will achieve better labeling performance than existing classification models when applied to small amounts of labeled data. The seed is labeled using posts of users with a known and consistent view on the topic. A semi-supervised multiclass prediction model labels the remaining data iteratively. In each iteration, it adds context-label pairs to the training set if softmax-based label probabilities are above the threshold. The proposed method is characterized on four datasets by comparison to the three popular text modeling algorithms (n-grams + tfidf, fastText, VDCNN) for different sizes of labeled seeds (5,000 and 50,000 posts) and for several label-prediction significance thresholds. Our proposed semi-supervised method outperformed alternative algorithms by capturing additional contexts from the unlabeled data. The accuracy of the algorithm was increasing by (3-10%) when using a larger fraction of data as the seed. For the smaller seed, lower label probability threshold was clearly a better choice, while for larger seeds no predominant threshold was observed. The proposed framework, using fastText library for efficient text classification and representation learning, achieved the best results for a smaller seed, while VDCNN wrapped in the proposed framework achieved the best results for the bigger seed. The performance was negatively influenced by the number of classes. Finally, the model was applied to characterize a biased dataset of opinions related to gun control/rights advocacy. The proposed semi-automatic seed labeling is used to label 8,448 twitter posts of 171 advocates for guns control/rights. On this application, our approach performed better than existing models and it achieves 96.5% accuracy and 0.68 F1 score.

TI  - Social media for field epidemiologists (#SoMe4epi): How to use Twitter during the #COVID19 pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public health professionals work and communicate. Over a very short time span, remote working arrangements have become the norm, and meetings have shifted online. Physical distancing measures have accelerated a trend toward digital communication and social exchange. At the same time, the work of epidemiologists has been held under a magnifying glass by journalists, governments and the general public, in a way not previously seen. With social media becoming an integral part of our society over the last decade, Twitter is now a key communication tool and platform for social networking among epidemiologists (#EpiTwitter). In this article, we reflect on the use of Twitter by field epidemiologists and public health microbiologists for rapid professional exchange, public communication of science and professional development during the pandemic and the associated risks. For those field epidemiologists new to social media, we discuss how Twitter can be used in a variety of ways, both at their home institutions and during field deployment. These include information dissemination, science communication and public health advocacy, professional development, networking and experience exchange.

TI  - Adolescents' Intense and Problematic Social Media Use and Their Well-Being in 29 Countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: This study examined (1) whether intense and problematic social media use (SMU) were independently associated with adolescent well-being; (2) whether these associations varied by the country-level prevalence of intense and problematic SMU; and (3) whether differences in the country-level prevalence of intense and problematic SMU were related to differences in mobile Internet access.
   Methods: Individual-level data came from 154,981 adolescents (mean(age) = 13.5) from 29 countries that participated in the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. Intense SMU was measured by the time spent on social media, whereas problematic SMU was defined by symptoms of addiction to social media. Mental (life satisfaction and psychological complaints), school (school satisfaction and perceived school pressure), and social (family support and friend support) well-being were assessed. Country-level data came from aggregated individual-level data and data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Internet access.
   Results: Two-level regression analyses indicated that in countries with a lower prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported lower levels of life satisfaction and family support and more psychological complaints than nonintense users. In contrast, in countries with a higher prevalence of intense SMU, intense users reported higher levels of family support and life satisfaction than 0nonintense users, and similar levels of psychological complaints. In all countries, intense users reported more friend support than nonintense users. The findings regarding problematic SMU were more consistent: In all countries, problematic users reported lower well-being on all domains than nonproblematic users. Observed differences in country-level prevalence rates of intense and problematic SMU could not be explained by mobile Internet access.
   Conclusions: Adolescents reporting problematic SMU are particularly at risk of lower well-being. In many countries, intense SMU may be a normative adolescent behavior that contributes positively to specific domains of their well-being.

TI  - EDBase: Generating a Lexicon Base for Eating Disorders Via Social Media
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by abnormal eating habits and obsessive thought about food, weight, shape, and body image. EDs are experienced by a significant portion of our population. Social media is identified as a possible source of influence for EDs, and there is growing evidence of a large amount of ED-related discussions on the Web via social media platforms, such as Twitter. With this growing trend, automatic content analysis for EDs is becoming increasingly important. To date, there does not exist any comprehensive benchmark ED lexicon to identify ED-related conversations that would, in turn, facilitate these content analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating a lexicon base for ED language, called EDBase. The method starts with collecting over 3.7 million ED-focused tweets. In order to semantically represent potential ED terminology in a vector space, an ED word embedding model (EDModel) is trained. Then we develop a novel multi-seeded hierarchical density-based algorithm with contrasting corpora for ED lexicon expansion. The EDModel is queried by the proposed lexicon expansion algorithm to expand the seed terms to a comprehensive lexicon base. Our EDBase consists of a (further expandable) list of 3794 high-quality ED terms, quantified by an ED score, and linked to their parent terms. The proposed method significantly outperforms all existing alternative baseline methods and models by over 25% in terms of precision and 1500 in terms of true positives. This research is expected to be impactful in the health data science and healthcare community.

TI  - Prescribing Associated with High-Risk Opioid Exposures Among Non-cancer Chronic Users of Opioid Analgesics: a Social Network Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundThe continued rise in fatalities from opioid analgesics despite a steady decline in the number of individual prescriptions directing >= 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day may be explained by patient exposures to redundant prescriptions from multiple prescribers.ObjectivesWe evaluated prescribers' specialty and social network characteristics associated with high-risk opioid exposures resulting from single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or multi-prescriber discoordination.DesignRetrospective cohort study.ParticipantsA cohort of prescribers with opioid analgesic prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users in an Illinois Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016.Main MeasuresPer prescriber rates of single-prescriber high-daily-dose prescriptions or multi-prescriber discoordination.Key ResultsFor 2280 beneficiaries, 36,798 opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers. Compared to 3% of prescriptions (involving 6% of prescribers and 7% of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13% of prescriptions (involving 23% of prescribers and 24% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential policy implications.

TI  - Social media use as a predictor of handwashing during a pandemic: evidence from COVID-19 in Malaysia
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Although handwashing is an effective way to prevent infections, there is scarce evidence on predictors of handwashing during a pandemic. This paper aims to identify behavioural and demographic predictors of handwashing. The study surveyed 674 adults in Malaysia in May 2020 regarding whether the time spent on social media predicted handwashing contingent on gender and number of children. More time spent on social media was positively associated with handwashing for males with three or more children. However, for males without children, social media use was negatively associated with handwashing. The association was not significant for males with one or two children. For females, more time spent on social media was significantly linked to more handwashing only for females with one child. Gender, a traditional predictor of handwashing, was a useful predictor only for those who spent more than three hours per day on social media and had at most one child. Number of children was a novel negative predictor for males who did not use social media and who averaged one hour per day on social media, a positive predictor for males who spent lots of time on social media, but not a predictor for females. In sum, social media use predicts handwashing, and is thus a helpful variable for use in targeted health communication during a pandemic - particularly through social media. Further, more conventional predictors like gender and number of children exhibit contingency effects with social media use.

TI  - The Application of the Principles of Responsible AI on Social Media Marketing for Digital Health
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB  - Social media enables medical professionals and authorities to share, disseminate, monitor, and manage health-related information digitally through online communities such as Twitter and Facebook. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed.

TI  - Social media use and cannabis vaping initiation among US youth
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Background: Youth cannabis vaping has increased in recent years, and there is growing evidence of cannabis vaping content on social media. This study investigated if social media use is associated with the initiation of cannabis vaping among US youth, using the youth dataset from Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Waves 4 (2016-2018) and 5 (2018-2019). Methods: Using youth respondents who never vaped cannabis at Wave 4 (N=8357), we conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis on initiation of cannabis vaping at Wave 5 (i.e., ever-vaped cannabis) by frequency of social media use, after controlling for covariates (e.g., sociodemographic, other tobacco and substance use). Results: In this analytic sample, 66.5% reported daily social media use, 16.2% reported non-daily and 17.3% reported 'not having a social media account' or 'no social media use' at Wave 4. Further, 14.0% (n=1183) initiated cannabis vaping at Wave 5. In the multivariable logistic regression model, daily social media use (vs. never use; aOR=2.68; 95% CI=2.05, 3.49) and non-daily social media use (vs. never use; aOR=1.54; 95% CI=1.14, 2.09) at Wave 4 were associated with cannabis vaping initiation at Wave 5. Conclusions: Our evidence suggests that social media use by youth is associated with cannabis vaping initiation among youth in subsequent years, even after controlling for other risk factors. Consistent surveillance and regulation of cannabis vaping-related content on social media, as well as prevention efforts, including counter -messaging on social media about the potential harms of cannabis vaping, are critically needed.

TI  - Examination of the temporal sequence between social media use and well-being in a representative sample of adults
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Given insufficient prospective evidence for relationships between social media use and well-being among adults, the present study examined the temporal sequence between social media use and psychological distress and life satisfaction, and explored age and gender differences. A representative sample of adults (N = 7331; 62.4% women; M-age = 51.94; SD = 13.48; 15-94 years) were surveyed annually across four waves. Cross-lagged panel models demonstrated bidirectional relationships between social media use and well-being. Higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction predicted higher social media use more strongly than the reverse direction, with effects particularly pronounced for the impact of psychological distress. Although the patterns of findings were relatively consistent across age and gender, results suggested that women and middle- and older-aged adults experience detrimental effects of social media use on well-being, which may drive subsequent increased use of social media. The bidirectional relationships suggest that adults who experience psychological distress or lower life satisfaction may seek to use social media as a way to alleviate poor well-being. However, paradoxically, this maladaptive coping mechanism appears to drive increased social media use which in turn can exacerbate poor well-being. Clinicians should be aware of these bidirectional relationships and work with clients towards replacing ineffective strategies with more helpful coping approaches. As this study used a simplistic measure of social media use, future research should address this limitation and explore nuanced relationships afforded by assessing specific social media activities or exposure to certain types of content.

TI  - Social Media based Simulation Models for Understanding Disease Dynamics
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CP  - 27th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)
AB  - In this modern era, infectious diseases, such as H1N1, SARS, and Ebola, are spreading much faster than any time in history. Efficient approaches are therefore desired to monitor and track the diffusion of these deadly epidemics. Traditional computational epidemiology models are able to capture the disease spreading trends through contact network, however, one unable to provide timely updates via real-world data. In contrast, techniques focusing on emerging social media platforms can collect and monitor real-time disease data, but do not provide an understanding of the underlying dynamics of ailment propagation. To achieve efficient and accurate real-time disease prediction, the framework proposed in this paper combines the strength of social media mining and computational epidemiology. Specifically, individual health status is first learned from user's online posts through Bayesian inference, disease parameters are then extracted for the computational models at population-level, and the outputs of computational epidemiology model are inversely fed into social media data based models for further performance improvement. In various experiments, our proposed model outperforms current disease forecasting approaches with better accuracy and more stability.

TI  - The Relationships Between Social Media and Human Papillomavirus Awareness and Knowledge: Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. HPV can infect both females and males, and it can cause many cancers, including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers. HPV vaccination rates are lower than vaccination rates within other national vaccination programs, despite its importance. Research literature indicates that people obtain health-related information from internet sources and social media; however, the association between such health-seeking behavior on social media and HPV-related behaviors has not been consistently demonstrated in the literature. Objective: This study aims to examine the association between social media usage and HPV knowledge and HPV awareness. Methods: This study analyzed public health data collected through the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) conducted by the US National Cancer Institute. The analysis used data collected in 2020; in total, 2948 responses were included in the analysis. Six HPV-related questions were used to identify HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, and HPV knowledge about HPV-related cancers. Four questions about social media usage and one question about online health information-seeking behavior were used to analyze the associations between social media usage and HPV-related behaviors. Initially, six logistic regressions were conducted using replicate weights. Based on the results, significant factors were included in a second set of regression analyses that also included demographic variables. Results: About half of the respondents were aware of HPV (68.40%), the HPV vaccine (64.04%), and the relationship between HPV and cervical cancer (48.00%). However, fewer respondents were knowledgeable about the relationships between HPV and penile cancer (19.18%), anal cancer (18.33%), and oral cancer (19.86%). Although social media usage is associated with HPV awareness, HPV vaccine awareness, and knowledge of cervical cancer, these associations were not significant after adjusting for demographic variables. Those less likely to report HPV awareness and knowledge included older participants, males, those with a household income of less than US $20,000, those with a formal education equal to or less than high school, or those who resided in a household where adults are not fluent in English. Conclusions: After adjusting for demographic variables, social media use was not related to HPV knowledge and awareness, and survey respondents were generally not aware that HPV can lead to specific types of cancer, other than cervical cancer. These results suggest that perhaps a lack of high-quality information on social media may impede HPV awareness and knowledge. Efforts to educate the public about HPV via social media might be improved by using techniques like storytelling or infographics, especially targeting vulnerable populations, such as older participants, males, those with low incomes, those with less formal education, or those who reside in the United States but are not fluent in English.

TI  - Social Media Use and Depressive Symptoms Among United States Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Depression is increasingly common among US adolescents; the extent to which social media exposure contributes to this increase remains controversial.
   Methods: We used Monitoring the Future data from 8th and 10th grade students (n = 74,472), 2009-2017, to assess the relationship between daily social media use and depressive symptoms. Self-reported depressive symptom score (range: 4-20) was assessed continuously using a log-transformed outcome and at varying cut scores with logistic regression analyses. First, these outcomes were examined overall, comparing adolescents using social media daily to adolescents who were not. We then estimated predicted depressive symptom scores using 26 predictors in order to establish underlying depression risk. We partitioned students into depression risk quintiles to control for confounding due to underlying depression risk and examine heterogeneity in the association between social media use and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of results with different configurations of the predicted score model, and overall associations were examined in two-year groups to identify differences in effects.
   Results: For girls, in adjusted risk-stratified analysis, daily social media use was not associated with high (vs. low) depressive symptoms. For boys, results were inconsistent, suggesting a protective effect of daily social media use at some cut scores. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and any potential harmful effects appear to be limited to 2009-2010, limiting the evidence supporting social media as a current risk factor for depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Among US adolescents, daily social media use is not a strong or consistent risk factor for depressive symptoms. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - Frequent Social Media Use and Its Prospective Association With Mental Health Problems in a Representative Panel Sample of US Adolescents
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: This study examined the relationship between frequent social media use , subsequent mental health in a representative sample of US adolescents. Also investigated were sex differences in multiyear growth trajectories of mental health problem internalization relative to social media use. Methods: Four waves (2013-2018) of nationally representative, longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health data were analyzed. A total of 5,114 US adolescents aged 12-14 years at baseline had repeated data across all waves. Statistical analysis involved testing a series of sequential-weighted single-group and multi-group latent growth curve models using R version 3.6.2. Results: Of the 5,114 respondents, 2,491 were girls (48.7%). The percentage of frequent social media use was 26.4% at Wave 1 and 69.1% at Wave 4 for boys compared to 38.3% and 80.6% for girls (p < .001). Boys showed an improving (-0.218, p = .005) but girls showed a deteriorating linear trend (0.229, p = .028) for mental health at the full multigroup latent growth curve model. Social media use accounted for mental health conditions across Waves 1-3 for boys (ps<.01) but only at Wave 1 for girls (p = .035). With the addition of the social media use variable alone, model fit dramatically improved , residual variances in growth patterns (i.e., random effect) became nonsignificant for boys. Substantial sex differences existed in baseline status, directionality, and shape of mental health growth trajectories as well as interplay of social media use with other factors. Discussion: Findings of the study suggest that frequent social media use is associated with poorer subsequent mental health for adolescents.(c) 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

TI  - Current ethical and social issues in epidemiology
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: The American College of Epidemiology held its 2021 Annual Meeting virtually, September 8-10, with a conference theme of 'From Womb to Tomb: Insights from Health Emergencies'. The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee hosted a symposium session in recognition of the ethical and social challenges brought to light by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and on the occasion of the publication of the third edition of the classic text, Ethics and Epidemiology. The American College of Epidemiology Ethics Committee invited the book editor and contributing authors to present at the symposium session titled 'Current Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology.' The purpose of this paper is to further highlight the ethical challenges and presentations.Methods: Three speakers with expertise in ethics, health law, health policy, global health, health information technology, and translational research in epidemiology and public health were selected to present on the social and ethical issues in the current landscape. Dr. S Coughlin presented on the 'Ethical and Social Issues in Epidemiology', Dr. L Beskow presented on 'Ethical Challenges in Genetic Epidemiology', and Dr. K Goodman presented on the 'Ethics of Health Informatics'.Results: New digital sources of data and technologies are driving the ethical challenges and opportunities in epidemiology and public health as it relates to the three emerging topic areas identified: (1) digital epidemiology, (2) genetic epidemiology, and (3) health informatics. New complexities such as the reliance on social media to control infectious disease outbreaks and the introduction of computing advancements are requiring re-evaluation of traditional bioethical frameworks for epidemiology research and public health practice. We identified several cross-cutting ethical and social issues related to informed consent, benefits, risks and harms, and privacy and confidentiality and summarized these alongside more nuanced ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias, group harms related to data (mis)representation, risks of misinformation, return of genomic research results, maintaining data security, and data sharing. We offered an integrated synthesis of the stages of epidemiology research planning and conduct with the ethical issues that are most relevant in these emerging topic areas.Conclusions: New realities exist for epidemiology and public health as professional groups who are faced with addressing population health, and especially given the recent pandemic and the widespread use of digital tools and technologies. Many ethical issues can be understood in the context of existing ethical frameworks; however, they have yet to be clearly identified or connected with the new technical and methodological applications of digital tools and technologies currently in use for epidemiology research and public health practice. To address current ethical challenges, we offered a synthesis of traditional ethical principles in public health science alongside more nuanced ethical considerations for emerging technologies and aligned these with lifecycle stages of epidemiology research. By critically reflecting on the impact of new digital sources of data and technologies on epidemiology research and public health practice, specifically in the control of infectious outbreaks, we offered insights on cultivating these new areas of professional growth while striving to improve population health.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Social Media as an Emerging Data Resource for Epidemiologic Research: Characteristics of Regular and Nonregular Social Media Users in Nurses' Health Study II
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - With advances in natural language processing and machine learning, researchers are leveraging social media as a low-cost, low-burden method for measuring various psychosocial factors. However, it is unclear whether information derived from social media is generalizable to broader populations, especially middle-aged and older adults. Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; n = 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (phi) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly "very small" (conventionally defined as phi or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: mean regular users = 19 vs. mean(nonregular users) = 19 (d = -0.03); physical activity: mean(regular users) = 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. mean(nonregular users) = 24 MET-hours/week (d = 0.01)). Some factors had slightly larger differences for regular users versus nonregular users (e.g., depression: 28% vs. 23% (phi = 0.05); odds ratio = 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.33); obesity: 34% vs. 26% (phi = 0.07); odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.36, 1.48)). Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms. In future research, investigators should evaluate other demographic groups.

TI  - Social Media's Influence on Parents' Decision-Making Process of Child Vaccinations
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: This study examined parent perceptions towards child vaccinations, and sources used leading to inoculation decisions.
   Methods: A survey was electronically dispersed to parents to examine their perceptions of vaccinations, what source they used to form their decisions, and whether or not they have their children vaccinated.
   Results: Significant differences on perceptions about vaccinations, those who followed the recommended vaccination schedule, and what sources of information they used were found. There was a significant relationship between parents who ranked using social media as their primary source and reports that they did not, or will not, vaccinate their children. Conclusions: Where parents obtain health-related information was shown to be a significant factor on vaccine perceptions and whether children were inoculated or not.

TI  - A New Method to Extract Health-Related Quality of Life Data From Social Media Testimonies: Algorithm Development and Validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Monitoring social media has been shown to be a useful means to capture patients' opinions and feelings about medical issues, ranging from diseases to treatments. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a useful indicator of overall patients' health, which can be captured online.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe a social media listening algorithm able to detect the impact of diseases or treatments on specific dimensions of HRQoL based on posts written by patients in social media and forums.
   Methods: Using a web crawler, 19 forums in France were harvested, and messages related to patients' experience with disease or treatment were specifically collected. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) and EQ-5D (Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions) HRQoL surveys were mixed and adapted for a tailored social media listening system. This was carried out to better capture the variety of expression on social media, resulting in 5 dimensions of the HRQoL, which are physical, psychological, activity-based, social, and financial. Models were trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Oversampling was used to increase the infrequent dimension: after annotation, SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) was used to balance the proportions of the dimensions among messages.
   Results: The training set was composed of 1399 messages, randomly taken from a batch of 20,000 health-related messages coming from forums. The algorithm was able to detect a general impact on HRQoL (sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.74), a physical impact (0.67 and 0.76), a psychic impact (0.82 and 0.60), an activity-related impact (0.73 and 0.78), a relational impact (0.73 and 0.70), and a financial impact (0.79 and 0.74).
   Conclusions: The development of an innovative method to extract health data from social media as real time assessment of patients' HRQoL is useful to a patient-centered medical care. As a source of real-world data, social media provide a complementary point of view to understand patients' concerns and unmet needs, as well as shedding light on how diseases and treatments can be a burden in their daily lives.

TI  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: insights from patient-generated data on social media
T2  - RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - Objectives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred online, through social media. This study aimed to provide patient perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based patient-generated health data (PGHD).
   Methods. A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by people with RMDs was extracted between 1 March and 12 July 2020 and examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint) conditions (ankylosing spondylitis, RA, PsA, lupus/SLE and gout).
   Results. The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (i) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (ii) critical changes in health behaviour; (iii) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (iv) difficulties with access to medical care; (v) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (vi) issues around work participation; (vii) negative effects of the media; and (viii) awareness-raising.
   Conclusion. The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs. The platform provided 'early signals' of potentially critical health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs, facilitate communication and inform clinical practice decisions.

TI  - Sample Bias in Web-Based Patient-Generated Health Data of Dutch Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor: Survey Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Increasingly, social media is being recognized as a potential resource for patient-generated health data, for example, for pharmacovigilance. Although the representativeness of the web-based patient population is often noted as a concern, studies in this field are limited.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the sample bias of patient-centered social media in Dutch patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).
   Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in the Netherlands among 328 patients with GIST diagnosed 2-13 years ago to investigate their digital communication use with fellow patients. A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze clinical and demographic differences between forum users and nonusers.
   Results: Overall, 17.9% (59/328) of survey respondents reported having contact with fellow patients via social media. Moreover, 78% (46/59) of forum users made use of GIST patient forums. We found no statistically significant differences for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time since diagnosis between forum users (n=46) and nonusers (n=273). Patient forum users did differ significantly in (self-reported) treatment phase from nonusers (P=.001). Of the 46 forum users, only 2 (4%) were cured and not being monitored; 3 (7%) were on adjuvant, curative treatment; 19 (41%) were being monitored after adjuvant treatment; and 22 (48%) were on palliative treatment. In contrast, of the 273 patients who did not use disease-specific forums to communicate with fellow patients, 56 (20.5%) were cured and not being monitored, 31 (11.3%) were on curative treatment, 139 (50.9%) were being monitored after treatment, and 42 (15.3%) were on palliative treatment. The odds of being on a patient forum were 2.8 times as high for a patient who is being monitored compared with a patient that is considered cured. The odds of being on a patient forum were 1.9 times as high for patients who were on curative (adjuvant) treatment and 10 times as high for patients who were in the palliative phase compared with patients who were considered cured. Forum users also reported a lower level of social functioning (84.8 out of 100) than nonusers (93.8 out of 100; P=.008).
   Conclusions: Forum users showed no particular bias on the most important demographic variables of age, sex, socioeconomic status, and time since diagnosis. This may reflect the narrowing digital divide. Overrepresentation and underrepresentation of patients with GIST in different treatment phases on social media should be taken into account when sourcing patient forums for patient-generated health data. A further investigation of the sample bias in other web-based patient populations is warranted.

TI  - Social isolation, social media use, and poor mental health among older adults, California Health Interview Survey 2019-2020
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundOlder adults' engagement on social media may be a resource to reduce loneliness and improve mental health. Purpose: This study aimed to examine loneliness and social media use and its association with severe psychological distress among older adults and whether social media use moderated the association of loneliness on severe psychological distress among older adults.MethodsThis study is a secondary analysis of the 2019-2020 California Health Interview Survey. The Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (K6) assessed symptoms of psychological distress, with a K6 score & GE; 13 associated with severe mental illness. Loneliness was measured using a revised Three Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) score. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between loneliness and severe psychological distress.ResultsLoneliness, health status, and identification as Asian, remained strong predictors of severe psychological distress among older adults when adjusting for other factors. In bivariate analysis, high-frequent social media users, but did not remain significant when accounting for covariates. Social media use did not moderate the association between loneliness and severe psychological distress.ConclusionThis study underscores the significant impact of loneliness on poor mental health among older adults, emphasizing that while frequent social media use correlates with severe psychological distress, it may not alleviate the association of loneliness on poor mental health, thus highlighting the urgent need to address social isolation and promote genuine social connectedness, particularly among Asian older adults.

TI  - Detection of emerging drugs involved in overdose via diachronic word embeddings of substances discussed on social media
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Substances involved in overdose deaths have shifted over time and continue to undergo transition. Early detection of emerging drugs involved in overdose is a major challenge for traditional public health data systems. While novel social media data have shown promise, there is a continued need for robust natural language processing approaches that can identify emerging substances. Consequently, we developed a new metric, the relative similarity ratio, based on diachronic word embeddings to measure movement in the semantic proximity of individual substance words to 'overdose' over time. Our analysis of 64,420,376 drug-related posts made between January 2011 and December 2018 on Reddit, the largest online forum site, reveals that this approach successfully identified fentanyl, the most significant emerging substance in the overdose epidemic, >1 year earlier than traditional public health data systems. Use of diachronic word embeddings may enable improved identification of emerging substances involved in drug overdose, thereby improving the timeliness of prevention and treatment activities.

TI  - Adolescent alcohol use: use of social network analysis and cross-classified multilevel modeling to examine peer group, school, and neighborhood-level influences
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
AB  - Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an important role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors. Methodological advances permit simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data; or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how each context may matter differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups, schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5%, 10.8%, and 0.4%, respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer networks.

TI  - Social Media Engagement and Influenza Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Vaccines are one of the most important achievements of modern medicine. However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19.
   Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns.
   Methods: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance.
   Results: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza.
   Conclusions: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.

TI  - Australasian Institute of Digital Health Summit 2022-Automated Social Media Surveillance for Detection of Vaccine Safety Signals: A Validation Study
T2  - APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background:Social media platforms have emerged as a valuable data source for public health research and surveillance. Monitoring of social media and user-generated data on the Web enables timely and inexpensive collection of information, overcoming time lag and cost of traditional health reporting systems. Objectives:This article identifies personally experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine reactions expressed on Twitter and validate the findings against an established vaccine reactions reporting system. Methods:We collected around 3 million tweets from 1.4 million users between February 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022, using COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine reactions keyword lists. We performed topic modeling on a sample of the data and applied a modified F1 scoring technique to identify a topic that best differentiated vaccine-related personal health mentions. We then manually annotated 4,000 of the records from this topic, which were used to train a transformer-based classifier to identify likely personally experienced vaccine reactions. Applying the trained classifier to the entire data set allowed us to select records we could use to quantify potential vaccine side effects. Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) referred to in these records were compared with those reported to the state of Victoria's spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community).Results The most frequently mentioned potential vaccine reactions generally aligned with SAEFVIC data. Notable exceptions were increased Twitter reporting of bleeding-related AEFI and allergic reactions, and more frequent SAEFVIC reporting of cardiac AEFI. Conclusion:Social media conversations are a potentially valuable supplementary data source for detecting vaccine adverse event mentions. Monitoring of online observations about new vaccine-related personal health experiences has the capacity to provide early warnings about emerging vaccine safety issues.

TI  - Is more always better? Exploring field survey and social media indicators of quality of urban greenspace, in relation to health
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB  - Despite the growing body of research exploring health benefits of greenspace, most studies treat greenspace as homogenous. There remains a need to focus on 'quality' rather than quantity of greenspace. Quality may be a substantial determinant for use and experience within greenspaces and therefore may influence health and wellbeing benefits derived from that use. This small-area level ecological study was undertaken within the city of Sheffield, UK. Health data were drawn from the general health question within the 2011 UK Census. Greenspace quality was measured using field surveys by Sheffield City Council and a range of measures from social media (from Flickr and Twitter). The extent to which quality measures extracted from social media were comparable to those from field surveys was explored to investigate whether they could proxy quality thus negating the requirement for resource intensive field surveys. The potential greenspace quality proxies from social media, however, showed low levels of correlation with quality measures from detailed field surveys. In exploring levels of health associated with greenspace quality - after adjustment for potential confounders - we found that greenspaces with lower quality, in terms of cleanliness, were associated with higher prevalence of self-reported poor health. The prevalence ratio of poor health for the quintile with the lowest cleanliness was 1.09 (95% CI 1.00-1.18), compared against the quintile with the highest cleanliness. We found little evidence of association between social media indicators of quality and poor health. Our work indicates that cleanliness of greenspace may affect adversely the health of surrounding residents. Whilst the precise mechanism for this is not yet known it is suggested that lack of cleanliness produces feelings of discomfort and insecurity, discouraging greenspace usage and inhibiting accrual of potential health and well-being benefits associated with that usage. This has important implications for greenspace provision and management.

TI  - Evaluating the predictability of medical conditions from social media posts
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We studied whether medical conditions across 21 broad categories were predictable from social media content across approximately 20 million words written by 999 consenting patients. Facebook language significantly improved upon the prediction accuracy of demographic variables for 18 of the 21 disease categories; it was particularly effective at predicting diabetes and mental health conditions including anxiety, depression and psychoses. Social media data are a quantifiable link into the otherwise elusive daily lives of patients, providing an avenue for study and assessment of behavioral and environmental disease risk factors. Analogous to the genome, social media data linked to medical diagnoses can be banked with patients' consent, and an encoding of social media language can be used as markers of disease risk, serve as a screening tool, and elucidate disease epidemiology. In what we believe to be the first report linking electronic medical record data with social media data from consenting patients, we identified that patients' Facebook status updates can predict many health conditions, suggesting opportunities to use social media data to determine disease onset or exacerbation and to conduct social media-based health interventions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Tremendous growth in the types of data that are collected and their interlinkage are enabling more predictions of individuals' behavior, health status, and diseases. Legislation in many countries treats health-related data as a special sensitive kind of data. Today's massive linkage of data, however, could transform "nonhealth" data into sensitive health data. In this paper, we argue that the notion of health data should be broadened and should also take into account past and future health data and indirect, inferred, and invisible health data. We also lay out the ethical and legal implications of our model.

TI  - Social Media Use Early in the Pandemic Predicted Later Social Well-Being and Mental Health in a National Online Sample of Adults in the United States
T2  - BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Social media use increased early in the Covid-19 pandemic, but little information is available about its impact. The present study examined associations of frequency of use of different social media and the motives for use with subsequent social well-being and mental health. Data were gathered on a nationwide sample of 843 Americans during the first wave of lockdowns and infections in mid-April 2020, and again five weeks later. Participants were adults ages 20 to 88 years old (M = 39.3 years old) recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Controlling for age and gender, greater frequency of Facebook and video chat app use predicted higher levels social support but also higher levels of cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Greater use of video chat apps also predicted less loneliness. Greater use of both Instagram and Snapchat predicted more anxiety and cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals. Greater use of Instagram also predicted higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Motives for use (e.g., connect with others, waste time/avoid responsibility, online video gaming with others) also differentially predicted social well-being and mental health. Results indicate that greater social media use early in the pandemic was often associated with more distress and lower levels of social well-being but, effects varied depending on types, frequency, and motivations for use. Overall, the study revealed that social media use related to social well-being and mental health in complex ways.

TI  - The Impact of Social Media on the Physical and Mental Well-Being of Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has increased social media engagement globally. This study examined the correlation between social media use and physical/mental health among university students, considering gender and academic year. Out of 146 responses, 119 were analyzed after excluding participants with pre-existing psychological conditions. Results showed a significant correlation between social media use and mental health for all participants (correlation coefficient = 0.30, p < 0.001), indicating a negative impact on mental health with increased use. Gender-specific analysis revealed a non-significant correlation among males (p = 0.21), while females exhibited a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.32, p = 0.01), suggesting an adverse effect on their mental health. Regarding physical health, females displayed an even higher correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.40, p < 0.001), highlighting the negative influence of social media on their physical well-being. Conversely, no significant correlation was observed among males. Analyzing by academic year, both pre-clerkship and clerkship students showed a significant correlation between social media use and mental health (correlation coefficients of 0.26, p = 0.01, and 0.42, p = 0.03, respectively). Similarly, a significant correlation was found between social media use and physical health among pre-clerkship students (correlation coefficient = 0.34, p = 0.001), but not among clerkship students. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the adverse impact of social media use on physical and mental health among university students, particularly among females and across different academic years. These findings underscore the importance of promoting healthy social media habits and raising awareness about the potential negative effects on well-being.

TI  - Does the number of hours spent daily on social media have any correlation to the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms in Saudi Adults?
T2  - WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: There is substantial evidence that links usage of social media as being marginally associated with numerous harmful effects on the human body consisting of adverse symptoms differing in their manifestation and onset of action. These include including anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, chronic fatigue, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). This study aimed to determine the relationship between the number of hours spent daily on social media and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms in Saudi adults.
   Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among the Saudi adult population. The method of distribution was performed by providing a self-administered, semi-structured online questionnaire containing 16 items designated as demographic information (i.e., age, gender, marital state, and residency), the prevalence of IBS, and frequency of social media usage.
   Results: Eight hundred and ten participants completed the survey (59.8% females vs. 40.2% males). The most common age group was 20-29 years (58.1%). 43% of participants recorded screen time of 6 hours or more, and 75.8% had used social media for six years or more. The prevalence of participants who were positive for IBS symptoms was 41.2%. In a multivariate regression model, female gender, associated chronic disease, and the use of Twitter were the significant independent predictors of IBS, but screen time did not predict the symptoms.
   Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, there was a high prevalence of IBS among the adult population living in Saudi Arabia. This study also demonstrated that the duration of social media use and the number of hours of screen time were not independently accounted for as predictors of IBS. Further research is needed to establish the link between IBS and the use of social media in the region.

TI  - Social Media Impact of the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Safety Communication Messaging About Zolpidem: Mixed-Methods Analysis
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues drug safety communications (DSCs) to health care professionals, patients, and the public when safety issues emerge related to FDA-approved drug products. These safety messages are disseminated through social media to ensure broad uptake.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the social media dissemination of 2 DSCs released in 2013 for the sleep aid zolpidem.
   Methods: We used the MedWatcher Social program and the DataSift historic query tool to aggregate Twitter and Facebook posts from October 1, 2012 through August 31, 2013, a period beginning approximately 3 months before the first DSC and ending 3 months after the second. Posts were categorized as (1) junk, (2) mention, and (3) adverse event (AE) based on a score between -0.2 (completely unrelated) to 1 (perfectly related). We also looked at Google Trends data and Wikipedia edits for the same time period. Google Trends search volume is scaled on a range of 0 to 100 and includes "Related queries" during the relevant time periods. An interrupted time series (ITS) analysis assessed the impact of DSCs on the counts of posts with specific mention of zolpidem-containing products. Chow tests for known structural breaks were conducted on data from Twitter, Facebook, and Google Trends. Finally, Wikipedia edits were pulled from the website's editorial history, which lists all revisions to a given page and the editor's identity.
   Results: In total, 174,286 Twitter posts and 59,641 Facebook posts met entry criteria. Of those, 16.63% (28,989/174,286) of Twitter posts and 25.91% (15,453/59,641) of Facebook posts were labeled as junk and excluded. AEs and mentions represented 9.21% (16,051/174,286) and 74.16% (129,246/174,286) of Twitter posts and 5.11% (3,050/59,641) and 68.98% (41,138/59,641) of Facebook posts, respectively. Total daily counts of posts about zolpidem-containing products increased on Twitter and Facebook on the day of the first DSC; Google searches increased on the week of the first DSC. ITS analyses demonstrated variability but pointed to an increase in interest around the first DSC. Chow tests were significant (P<.0001) for both DSCs on Facebook and Twitter, but only the first DSC on Google Trends. Wikipedia edits occurred soon after each DSC release, citing news articles rather than the DSC itself and presenting content that needed subsequent revisions for accuracy.
   Conclusions: Social media offers challenges and opportunities for dissemination of the DSC messages. The FDA could consider strategies for more actively disseminating DSC safety information through social media platforms, particularly when announcements require updating. The FDA may also benefit from directly contributing content to websites like Wikipedia that are frequently accessed for drug-related information.

TI  - Endangered Exotic Pets on Social Media in the Middle East: Presence and Impact
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary: The exotic pet trade is impacted by social media via greater accessibility to photos and videos including these species and the increasing popularity of online animal marketplaces. The social media presence of public figures owning exotic pets has a major influence on exotic species demand. This study aimed to investigate exotic pet popularity, featured species on social media in the Middle East, and public perception of the animals spotlighted by public figures. We discuss the impact of such on the exotic pet trade and possible solutions to this issue. Male public figures from the United Arab Emirates predominated in the collected data, with most posts sourced from Instagram (R). Eighty-five percent of the species displayed on social media posts were Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I- and II-listed, including big cats, birds of prey, and great apes. Through an investigation of social media posts of public figures in the Middle East, we found that there was an overall positive audience reception toward endangered exotic pets. Geographic region, social media platform, animal species, and animal age all influenced the results. We recommend improving public education and awareness of wildlife conservation and laws regarding exotic pet possession to combat the idolization of the exotic pet industry. The popularization of exotic pets on celebrity social media in the Middle East has led to questionable impacts on exotic pet demand and threats to species conservation. The objective of this study was to identify exotic animal species featured on Middle Eastern celebrity social media account posts, the public perception of those posts, and their potential impacts on exotic pet demand and conservation (for global-scale extrapolation). Public social media accounts of highly influential persons from oil-rich Middle Eastern regions were manually investigated to evaluate subject demographics, species features, and post information (likes, comments) between January 2017 and August 2018. Twenty-five subjects possessed active social media accounts, from which 418 social media posts were extracted based on their inclusion of a privately owned exotic animal. SPSS Version 25 was used for frequency and descriptive analyses of these posts, in addition to comment analyses to evaluate quantitative (emojis) and qualitative (text) audience perceptions from a total of 10 social media posts of CITES Appendix I- or II-listed species. A greater frequency of positive than negative comments was observed (n = 8017), demonstrating the higher likelihood of social media promotion rather than negation of the exotic pet trade. Public education on wildlife conservation and exotic animal trade risks is imperative for successful conservation and welfare protection.

TI  - Using Patient-Reported Health Data From Social Media to Identify Diverse Lupus Patients and Assess Their Symptom and Medication Expressions: A Feasibility Study
T2  - ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH
AB  - Objective Patient communities use social media for peer support and information seeking. This study assessed the feasibility of using public patient-generated health data from the social network Twitter to identify diverse lupus patients and gather their perspectives about disease symptoms and medications. Methods We extracted public lupus-related Twitter messages (n = 47,715 tweets) in English posted by users (n = 8,446) in the US between September 1, 2017 and October 31, 2018. We analyzed the data to describe lupus patients and the expressed themes (symptoms and medications). Two independent coders analyzed the data; Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to ensure interrater reliability. Differences in symptom and medication expressions were analyzed using 2-tailed Z tests and a combination of 1-way analysis of variance tests and unpaired t-tests. Results We found that lupus patients on Twitter are diverse in gender and race: approximately one-third (34.64%, 62 of 179) were persons of color (POCs), and 85.47% were female. The expressed disease symptoms and medications varied significantly by gender and race. Most of our findings correlated with documented clinical observations, e.g., expressions of general pain (8.39%, 709 of 8,446), flares (6.05%, 511 of 8,446), and fatigue (4.18%, 353 of 8,446). However, our data also revealed less well-known patient observations, e.g., possible racial disparities within ocular manifestations of lupus. Conclusion Our results indicate that social media surveillance can provide valuable data of clinical relevance from the perspective of lupus patients. The medical community has the opportunity to harness this information to inform the patient-centered care within underrepresented patient groups, such as POCs.

TI  - Social media mining for birth defects research: A rule-based, bootstrapping approach to collecting data for rare health-related events on Twitter
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Although birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, methods for observing human pregnancies with birth defect outcomes are limited.
   Objective: The primary objectives of this study were (i) to assess whether rare health-related events-in this case, birth defects-are reported on social media, (ii) to design and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) approach for collecting such sparse data from social media, and (iii) to utilize the collected data to discover a cohort of women whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed on social media for epidemiological analysis.
   Methods: To assess whether birth defects are mentioned on social media, we mined 432 million tweets posted by 112,647 users who were automatically identified via their public announcements of pregnancy on Twitter. To retrieve tweets that mention birth defects, we developed a rule-based, bootstrapping approach, which relies on a lexicon, lexical variants generated from the lexicon entries, regular expressions, post-processing, and manual analysis guided by distributional properties. To identify users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes could be observed for epidemiological analysis, inclusion criteria were (i) tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect, and (ii) accessibility to the user's tweets during pregnancy. We conducted a semi-automatic evaluation to estimate the recall of the tweet-collection approach, and performed a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of selected birth defects among the pregnancy cohort derived from Twitter.
   Results: We manually annotated 16,822 retrieved tweets, distinguishing tweets indicating that the user's child has a birth defect (true positives) from tweets that merely mention birth defects (false positives). Inter-annotator agreement was substantial: K = 0.79 (Cohen's kappa). Analyzing the timelines of the 646 users whose tweets were true positives resulted in the discovery of 195 users that met the inclusion criteria. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect reported on Twitter, consistent with findings in the general population. Based on an evaluation of 4169 tweets retrieved using alternative text mining methods, the recall of the tweet collection approach was 0.95.
   Conclusions: Our contributions include (i) evidence that rare health-related events are indeed reported on Twitter, (ii) a generalizable, systematic NLP approach for collecting sparse tweets, (iii) a semi-automatic method to identify undetected tweets (false negatives), and (iv) a collection of publicly available tweets by pregnant users with birth defect outcomes, which could be used for future epidemiological analysis. In future work, the annotated tweets could be used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically identify users reporting birth defect outcomes, enabling the large-scale use of social media mining as a complementary method for such epidemiological research.

TI  - Risk of recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy: survey from a social media group
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare but serious complication in the last trimester of pregnancy or postpartum period. Data on the recurrence risk are largely unavailable, as only case reports or very small case series exist in which only 1 woman had recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the risk of acute fatty liver of pregnancy recurrence and to compare disease severity and gestational age between primary and recurrent disease using patient-provided data from an acute fatty liver of pregnancy social media patient group.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and distributed an electronic questionnaire through an international Facebook group called "Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy." The data collection took place from June 11, 2018, to August 17, 2018, using REDCap. Our main outcome measures were recurrence of acute fatty liver of pregnancy, severity with recurrence, and gestational age at delivery.
   RESULTS: A total of 69 women with previous acute fatty liver of pregnancy completed the questionnaire; 24 women had a subsequent delivery, of whom 5 women were diagnosed with acute fatty liver of pregnancy again. In 4 of 5 of these women (80%), acute fatty liver of pregnancy took a milder course, whereas in 1 woman it worsened in the next pregnancy. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy recurrence delivered at a median gestational age at 265 days (interquartile range, 242-287 days) in their first pregnancy with acute fatty liver of pregnancy as compared to delivery by a prelabor cesarean delivery at 245 days (interquartile range, 235-261 days) in their second pregnancy with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Male fetal sex was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
   CONCLUSION: One in 5 women reported having had recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy, with most cases being milder, possibly because of an earlier gestational age at delivery.

TI  - Cross-Verification of COVID-19 Information Obtained From Unofficial Social Media Accounts and Associated Changes in Health Behaviors: Web-Based Questionnaire Study Among Chinese Netizens
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: As social media platforms have become significant sources of information during the pandemic, a significant volume of both factual and inaccurate information related to the prevention of COVID-19 has been disseminated through social media. Thus, disparities in COVID-19 information verification across populations have the potential to promote the dissemination of misinformation among clustered groups of people with similar characteristics.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the characteristics of social media users who obtained COVID-19 information through unofficial social media accounts and were (1) most likely to change their health behaviors according to web-based information and (2) least likely to actively verify the accuracy of COVID-19 information, as these individuals may be susceptible to inaccurate prevention measures and may exacerbate transmission.
   Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was disseminated by West China Hospital via its official online platforms, between May 18, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The questionnaire collected the sociodemographic information of 14,509 adults, and included questions surveying Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19, personal social media use, health behavioral change tendencies, and cross-verification behaviors for web-based information during the pandemic. Multiple stepwise regression models were used to examine the relationships between social media use, behavior changes, and information cross-verification.
   Results: Respondents who were most likely to change their health behaviors after obtaining web-based COVID-19 information from celebrity sources had the following characteristics: female sex (P=.004), age >= 50 years (P=.009), higher COVID-19 knowledge and health literacy (P=.045 and P=.03, respectively), non-health care professional (P=.02), higher frequency of searching on social media (P<.001), better health conditions (P<.001), and a trust rating score of more than 3 for information released by celebrities on social media (P=.005). Furthermore, among participants who were most likely to change their health behaviors according to social media information released by celebrities, female sex (P<.001), living in a rural residence rather than first-tier city (P<.001), self-reported medium health status and lower health care literacy (P=.007 and P<.001, respectively), less frequent search for COVID-19 information on social media (P<.001), and greater level of trust toward celebrities' social media accounts with a trust rating score greater than 1 (P <=.04) were associated with a lack of cross-verification of information.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that governments, health care agencies, celebrities, and technicians should combine their efforts to decrease the risk in vulnerable groups that are inclined to change health behaviors according to web-based information but do not perform any fact-check verification of the accuracy of the unofficial information. Specifically, it is necessary to correct the false information related to COVID-19 on social media, appropriately apply celebrities' star power, and increase Chinese netizens' awareness of information cross-verification and eHealth literacy for evaluating the veracity of web-based information.

TI  - Using Tweets to Understand How COVID-19-Related Health Beliefs Are Affected in the Age of Social Media: Twitter Data Analysis Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ie, COVID-19) has given rise to a global pandemic affecting 215 countries and over 40 million people as of October 2020. Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media.
   Methods: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures.
   Results: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R(0 )of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively).
   Conclusions: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R-0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is "unhealthy" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.

TI  - Real-life closeness of social media contacts and depressive symptoms among university students
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To examine the association between degree of real-life closeness of social media (SM) contacts and depressive symptoms. Participants: Students ages 18-30 (N = 1124) were recruited in August 2016. Methods: Participants completed an online survey assessing SM use and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations between real-life closeness of SM contacts and depressive symptoms. Results: After controlling for covariates, each 10% increase in the proportion of SM friends with whom participants had no face-to-face relationship was associated with a 9% increase in odds of depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.05-1.13). However, each 10% increase in the proportion of SM friends with whom participants had a close face-to-face relationship was associated with a 7% decrease in depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89-0.97). Conclusions: Having no in-person relationship with SM contacts is associated with increased depressive symptoms; however, having close in-person relationships with SM contacts is associated with decreased depressive symptoms.

TI  - Characterising communities impacted by the 2015 Indiana HIV outbreak: A big data analysis of social media messages associated with HIV and substance abuse
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
AB  - Introduction and Aims Infoveillance approaches (i.e. surveillance methods using online content) that leverage big data can provide new insights about infectious disease outbreaks and substance use disorder topics. We assessed social media messages about HIV, opioid use and injection drug use in order to understand how unstructured data can prepare public health practitioners for response to future outbreaks.
   Design and Methods We conducted an retrospective analysis of Twitter messages during the 2015 HIV Indiana outbreak using machine learning, statistical and geospatial analysis to examine the transition between opioid prescription drug abuse to heroin injection use and finally HIV transmission risk, and to test possible associations with disease burden and demographic variables in Indiana and Marion County. Tweets from October 2014 to June 2015 were compared to disease burden at the county level for Indiana, and classification of census blocks by presence of relevant messages was done at the census block level for Marion County. Marion County was used as it exhibited the highest total count of Tweets.
   Results 257 messages about substance abuse and HIV were significantly related to HIV rates (P < 0.001) and opioid-related hospitalisations (P = 0.037). Using 157 characteristics from the American Community Survey, a linear classifier was computed with an appreciable correlation (r = 0.49) to risk-related social media messages from Marion County.
   Discussion and Conclusions Communities appear to communicate online in response to disease burden. Classification produced an accurate equation to model census block risk based on census data, allowing for high-dimensional estimation of risk for blocks with sparse populations.

TI  - Big Data and Infectious Disease Epidemiology: Bibliometric Analysis and Research Agenda
T2  - INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Infectious diseases represent a major challenge for health systems worldwide. With the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, the need to research strategies to treat these health problems has become even more pressing. Although the literature on big data and data science in health has grown rapidly, few studies have synthesized these individual studies, and none has identified the utility of big data in infectious disease surveillance and modeling.Objective: The aim of this study was to synthesize research and identify hotspots of big data in infectious disease epidemiology. Methods: Bibliometric data from 3054 documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria retrieved from the Web of Science database over 22 years (2000-2022) were analyzed and reviewed. The search retrieval occurred on October 17, 2022. Bibliometric analysis was performed to illustrate the relationships between research constituents, topics, and key terms in the retrieved documents.Results: The bibliometric analysis revealed internet searches and social media as the most utilized big data sources for infectious disease surveillance or modeling. The analysis also placed US and Chinese institutions as leaders in this research area. Disease monitoring and surveillance, utility of electronic health (or medical) records, methodology framework for infodemiology tools, and machine/deep learning were identified as the core research themes.Conclusions: Proposals for future studies are made based on these findings. This study will provide health care informatics scholars with a comprehensive understanding of big data research in infectious disease epidemiology.

TI  - Perceived Unmet Needs in Patients Living With Advanced Bladder Cancer and Their Caregivers: Infodemiology Study Using Data From Social Media in the United States
T2  - JMIR CANCER
AB  - Background: Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer (BC), which is generally termed advanced BC (aBC), has a very poor prognosis, and in addition to its physical symptoms, it is associated with emotional and social challenges. However, few studies have assessed the unmet needs and burden of aBC from patient and caregiver perspectives. Infodemiology, that is, epidemiology based on internet health-related content, can help obtain more insights on patients' and caregivers' experiences with aBC.
   Objective: The study aimed to identify the main discussion themes and the unmet needs of patients with aBC and their caregivers through a mixed methods analysis of social media posts.
   Methods: Social media posts were collected between January 2015 and April 2021 from US geolocalized sites using specific keywords for aBC. Automatic natural language processing (regular expressions and machine learning) methods were used to filter out irrelevant content and identify verbatim posts from patients and caregivers. The verbatim posts were analyzed to identify main discussion themes using biterm topic modeling. Difficulties or unmet needs were further explored using qualitative research methods by 2 independent annotators until saturation of concepts.
   Results: A total of 688 posts from 262 patients and 1214 posts from 679 caregivers discussing aBC were identified. Analysis of 340 randomly selected patient posts and 423 randomly selected caregiver posts uncovered 33 unique unmet need categories among patients and 36 among caregivers. The main unmet patient needs were related to challenges regarding adverse events (AEs; 28/95, 29%) and the psychological impact of aBC (20/95, 21%). Other patient unmet needs identified were prognosis or diagnosis errors (9/95, 9%) and the need for better management of aBC symptoms (9/95, 9%). The main unmet caregiver needs were related to the psychological impacts of aBC (46/177, 26.0%), the need for support groups and to share experiences between peers (28/177, 15.8%), and the fear and management of patient AEs (22/177, 12.4%).
   Conclusions: The combination of manual and automatic methods allowed the extraction and analysis of several hundreds of social media posts from patients with aBC and their caregivers. The results highlighted the emotional burden of cancer for both patients and caregivers. Additional studies on patients with aBC and their caregivers are required to quantitatively explore the impact of this disease on quality of life.

TI  - Drug Abuse Ontology to Harness Web-Based Data for Substance Use Epidemiology Research: Ontology Development Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Web-based resources and social media platforms play an increasingly important role in health-related knowledge and experience sharing. There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.Objective: The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.Methods: The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.Results: The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.Conclusions: The DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research.

TI  - Understanding Public Perceptions of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Social Media Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
   Objective: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom.
   Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches.
   Results: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.
   Conclusions: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.

TI  - Online Communication about Depression and Anxiety among Twitter Users with Schizophrenia: Preliminary Findings to Inform a Digital Phenotype Using Social Media
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY
AB  - Digital technologies hold promise for supporting the detection and management of schizophrenia. This exploratory study aimed to generate an initial understanding of whether patterns of communication about depression and anxiety on popular social media among individuals with schizophrenia are consistent with offline representations of the illness. From January to July 2016, posts on Twitter were collected from a sample of Twitter users who self-identify as having a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 203) and a randomly selected sample of control users (n = 173). Frequency and timing of communication about depression and anxiety were compared between groups. In total, the groups posted n = 1,544,122 tweets and users had similar characteristics. Twitter users with schizophrenia showed significantly greater odds of tweeting about depression compared with control users (OR = 2.69; 95% CI 1.76-4.10), and significantly greater odds of tweeting about anxiety compared with control users (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.20-2.73). This study offers preliminary insights that Twitter users with schizophrenia may express elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety in their online posts, which is consistent with clinical characteristics of schizophrenia observed in offline settings. Social media platforms could further our understanding of schizophrenia by informing a digital phenotype and may afford new opportunities to support early illness detection.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Social Media Analysis for Pharmacovigilance of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United Kingdom: Observational Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19-related keywords and then using vaccine-and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes.

TI  - The role of social media in public health crises caused by infectious disease: a scoping review
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - ImportanceThe onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic highlighted the increasing role played by social media in the generation, dissemination and consumption of outbreak-related information.ObjectiveThe objective of the current review is to identify and summarise the role of social media in public health crises caused by infectious disease, using a five-step scoping review protocol.Evidence reviewKeyword lists for two categories were generated: social media and public health crisis. By combining these keywords, an advanced search of various relevant databases was performed to identify all articles of interest from 2000 to 2021, with an initial retrieval date of 13 December 2021. A total of six medical and health science, psychology, social science and communication databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO and CNKI. A three-stage screening process against inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted.FindingsA total of 338 studies were identified for data extraction, with the earliest study published in 2010. Thematic analysis of the role of social media revealed three broad themes: surveillance monitoring, risk communication and disease control. Within these themes, 12 subthemes were also identified. Within surveillance monitoring, the subthemes were disease detection and prediction, public attitude and attention, public sentiment and mental health. Within risk communication, the subthemes were health advice, information-seeking behaviour, infodemics/misinformation circulation, seeking help online, online distance education and telehealth. Finally, within disease control, the subthemes were government response, public behaviour change and health education information quality. It was clear that the pace of research in this area has gradually increased over time as social media has evolved, with an explosion in attention following the outbreak of COVID-19.Conclusions and relevanceSocial media has become a hugely powerful force in public health and cannot be ignored or viewed as a minor consideration when developing public health policy. Limitations of the study are discussed, along with implications for government, health authorities and individual users. The pressing need for government and health authorities to formalise evidence-based strategies for communicating via social media is highlighted, as well as issues for individual users in assessing the quality and reliability of information consumed on social media platforms.

TI  - Patients' willingness to share digital health and non-health data for research: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB  - Background Patients generate large amounts of digital data through devices, social media applications, and other online activities. Little is known about patients' perception of the data they generate online and its relatedness to health, their willingness to share data for research, and their preferences regarding data use. Methods Patients at an academic urban emergency department were asked if they would donate any of 19 different types of data to health researchers and were asked about their views on data types' health relatedness. Factor analysis was used to identify the structure in patients' perceptions of willingness to share different digital data, and their health relatedness. Results Of 595 patients approached 206 agreed to participate, of whom 104 agreed to share at least one types of digital data immediately, and 78% agreed to donate at least one data type after death. EMR, wearable, and Google search histories (80%) had the highest percentage of reported health relatedness. 72% participants wanted to know the results of any analysis of their shared data, and half wanted their healthcare provider to know. Conclusion Patients in this study were willing to share a considerable amount of personal digital data with health researchers. They also recognize that digital data from many sources reveal information about their health. This study opens up a discussion around reconsidering US privacy protections for health information to reflect current opinions and to include their relatedness to health.

In this review and introduction to the themed issue on "Spatial Analysis and GIS in Epidemiology," we present theoretical foundations and methodological developments in spatial epidemiology, discuss spatial analytical techniques and their public health applications, and identify novel data sources and applications with the potential to make epidemiology more consequential. Challenges with using georeferenced data are also explored, including dealing with small sample sizes, missingness, generalizability, and geographic scale. Given the increasing availability of spatial data and visualization tools, we have an opportunity to overcome traditionally siloed fields and practice settings to advance knowledge and more appropriately respond to emerging public health crises.

TI  - Social media as a recruitment platform for a nationwide online survey of COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices in the United States: methodology and feasibility analysis
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into one of the most impactful health crises in modern history, compelling researchers to explore innovative ways to efficiently collect public health data in a timely manner. Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. Objectives This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. Methods An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. Results In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. Conclusions The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.

TI  - Understanding Psycholinguistic Behavior of predominant drunk texters in Social Media
T2  - 2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS (ISCC)
CP  - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (IEEE ISCC)
AB  - In the last decade, social media has evolved as one of the leading platform to create, share, or exchange information; it is commonly used as a way for individuals to maintain social connections. In this online digital world, people use to post texts or pictures to express their views socially and create user-user engagement through discussions and conversations. Thus, social media has established itself to bear signals relating to human behavior. One can easily design user characteristic network by scraping through someone's social media profiles. In this paper, we investigate the potential of social media in characterizing and understanding predominant drunk texters from the perspective of their social, psychological and linguistic behavior as evident from the content generated by them. Our research aims to analyze the behavior of drunk texters on social media and to contrast this with non-drunk texters. We use Twitter social media to obtain the set of drunk texters and non-drunk texters and show that we can classify users into these two respective sets using various psycholinguistic features with an overall average accuracy of 96.78% with very high precision and recall. Note that such an automatic classification can have far-reaching impact - (i) on health research related to addiction prevention and control, and (ii) in eliminating abusive and vulgar contents from Twitter, borne by the tweets of drunk texters.

TI  - SMARTS: the social media-based addiction recovery and intervention targeting server
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation: Substance abuse and addiction is a significant contemporary health crisis. Modeling its epidemiology and designing effective interventions requires real-time data analysis along with the means to contextualize addiction patterns across the individual-to-community scale. In this context, social media platforms have begun to receive significant attention as a novel source of real-time user-reported information. However, the ability of epidemiologists to use such information is significantly stymied by the lack of publicly available algorithms and software for addiction information extraction, analysis and modeling.
   Results: SMARTS is a public, open source, web-based application that addresses the aforementioned deficiency. SMARTS is designed to analyze data from two popular social media forums, namely, Reddit and Twitter and can be used to study the effect of various intoxicants including, opioids, weed, kratom, alcohol and cigarettes. The SMARTS software analyzes social media posts using natural language processing, and machine learning to characterize drug use at both the individual- and population-levels. Included in SMARTS is a predictive modeling functionality that can, with high accuracy, identify individuals open to addiction recovery interventions. SMARTS also supports extraction, analysis and visualization of a number of key informational and demographic characteristics including post topics and sentiment, drug- and recovery-term usage, geolocation and age. Finally, the distributions of the aforementioned characteristics as derived from a set of 170 097 drug users are provided as part of SMARTS and can be used by researchers as a reference.

TI  - Longitudinal social network analysis of avian mycobacteriosis incidence in a large population of zoo birds
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 % CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.

TI  - Implications of social media misinformation on COVID-19 vaccine confidence among pregnant women in Africa
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - It has been over a year since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and subsequently a global pandemic. The world has experienced a lot of uncertainty since then as we all get used to this new 'normal' with social distancing measures, lockdowns, the emergence of new variants, and an array of hope with the development of vaccines. Having an abstract understanding of vaccine delivery, public perceptions of vaccines, and promoting acceptance of vaccines are critical to tackling the pandemic. The advent of the pandemic has led to the emergence of an 'infodemic' or rampant misinformation surrounding the virus, treatment, and vaccines. This poses a critical threat to global health as it has the potential to lead to a public health crisis by exacerbating disease spread and overwhelming healthcare systems. This 'infodemic' has led to rising vaccine hesitancy which is of paramount concern with the WHO even identifying it as one of the ten main threats to Global health almost 2 years before the approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant African women are one of the most vulnerable population groups in a region with an already burdened healthcare system. Currently, there isn't ample research in the literature that explores vaccine hesitancy in this subpopulation and the impact of social media misinformation surrounding it. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implications of this 'infodemic' on the pregnant African population and suggest key recommendations for improved healthcare strategies.

TI  - Online flu epidemiological deep modeling on disease contact network
T2  - GEOINFORMATICA
AB  - The surveillance and preventions of infectious disease epidemics such as influenza and Ebola are important and challenging issues. It is therefore crucial to characterize the disease progress and epidemics process efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the progression of the disease and its underlying contact network, but as yet lacks the ability to process of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised neural network framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques for influenza epidemiological modeling. Specifically, this framework learns social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. The learned knowledge from social media can then be fed into the computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm that iteratively processes the above interactive learning process. The extensive experimental results provided demonstrated that our approach can not only outperform competing methods by a substantial margin in forecasting disease outbreaks, but also characterize the individual-level disease progress and diffusion effectively and efficiently.

TI  - Determinants of American Adults&apos; Use of Digital Health and Willingness to Share Health Data to Providers, Family, and Social Media
T2  - CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING
AB  - With the global pandemic driving the adoption of digital health, understanding the predictors or determinants of digital health usage and information sharing gives an opportunity to advocate for broader adoption. We examined the prevalence and predictors of digital health usage and information-sharing behaviors among American adults. Data were from the Health Information National Trends Survey 5 Cycle 4. More than two-thirds used a digital resource for health-related activities (eg, to check test results). About 81% were willing to share their digital data with their provider, 75% with family, and 58% with friends. Only 14% shared health information on social media. Gender, education, device types, and performance expectancy of digital health were common factors associated with both digital health usage and information-sharing behaviors. Other predictors included rurality, patient portal access, income, and having a chronic disease. Of note, we found that Asian American Pacific Islanders, compared with Whites, were less likely to share information with providers. Performance expectancy was a significant determinant of information sharing. Those diagnosed with diabetes were 4% less likely to share information with their providers. With the growing digital divide, there is a need to advocate for more usable and accessible digital health to assist with person-centered care.

TI  - Enabling realistic health data re-identification risk assessment through adversarial modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objective: Re-identification risk methods for biomedical data often assume a worst case, in which attackers know all identifiable features (eg, age and race) about a subject. Yet, worst-case adversarial modeling can overestimate risk and induce heavy editing of shared data. The objective of this study is to introduce a framework for assessing the risk considering the attacker's resources and capabilities.
   Materials and Methods: We integrate 3 established risk measures (ie, prosecutor, journalist, and marketer risks) and compute re-identification probabilities for data subjects. This probability is dependent on an attacker's capabilities (eg, ability to obtain external identified resources) and the subject's decision on whether to reveal their participation in a dataset. We illustrate the framework through case studies using data from over 1 000 000 patients from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and show how re-identification risk changes when attackers are pragmatic and use 2 known resources for attack: (1) voter registration lists and (2) social media posts.
   Results: Our framework illustrates that the risk is substantially smaller in the pragmatic scenarios than in the worst case. Our experiments yield a median worst-case risk of 0.987 (where 0 is least risky and 1 is most risky); however, the median reduction in risk was 90.1% in the voter registration scenario and 100% in the social media posts scenario. Notably, these observations hold true for a wide range of adversarial capabilities.
   Conclusions: This research illustrates that re-identification risk is situationally dependent and that appropriate adversarial modeling may permit biomedical data sharing on a wider scale than is currently the case.

TI  - The use of social media platforms to discuss and educate the public on allergic contact dermatitis
T2  - CONTACT DERMATITIS
AB  - Background Social media platforms are increasingly used by patients to research and discuss medical problems. Objective The aim of this study was to identify by whom, how frequently, and in what manner allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is discussed on social media sites. Methods Search terms "allergic contact dermatitis" and "contact dermatitis" were queried across Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Google search metrics. The frequency, content, and creators of the content were assessed. Results ACD content was identified on all platforms, generated by by patients, physicians, professional organizations, and companies. When comparing the volume of posts, more content was on Instagram than Twitter, particularly among patients. Patient support groups were identified on Facebook but not on Reddit. A formal analysis of YouTube videos found that the medical information presented in these videos was often of poor quality. Conclusions Patch testing physicians should be aware that information on ACD exists across social media sites. While some content is generated by physicians, patients and industry groups also post and share material. Patch testing physicians should know that there is an opportunity to share ACD information, but they should also be aware that patients are posting and creating online support communities independent of physicians. Highlights Online support communities exist for patients with ACD on Facebook. Online information is of lower quality, with a mean QUEST quality score of 7.4/28 on reviewed YouTube videos. Of the five social media sites reviewed, patients are most active on Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook. Approximately 9000 Google searches per month are conducted using contact dermatitis-related search terms. Differences in terminology exist between physicians and non-physicians. While the most popular hashtag term was "contact dermatitis", physicians disproportionately authored posts tagged with "allergic contact dermatitis."

TI  - Social network analysis methods for exploring SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data
T2  - BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
AB  - Background Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate basic epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set with diagnosed patients as "nodes" and their epidemiological contact as "edges" was created. Directed network perspective was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a "source patient" towards a "target patient". Network measures of "degree centrality" and "betweenness centrality" were calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65% (12) patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have collectively infected 37.61% (296 of 787), secondary patients. Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network component analysis identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95% of total patients (1959) and 68.74% of epidemiological contacts in the network. Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help improve the contact tracing activities.

TI  - Linking Individual-Level Facebook Posts With Psychological and Health Data in an Epidemiological Cohort: Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Psychological factors (eg, depression) and related biological and behavioral responses are associated with numerous physical health outcomes. Most research in this area relies on self-reported assessments of psychological factors, which are difficult to scale because they may be expensive and time-consuming. Investigators are increasingly interested in using social media as a novel and convenient platform for obtaining information rapidly in large populations.
   Objective: We evaluated the feasibility of obtaining Facebook data from a large ongoing cohort study of midlife and older women, which may be used to assess psychological functioning efficiently with low cost.
   Methods: This study was conducted with participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), which was initiated in 1989 with biennial follow-ups. Facebook does not share data readily; therefore, we developed procedures to enable women to download and transfer their Facebook data to cohort servers (for linkage with other study data they have provided). Since privacy is a critical concern when collecting individual-level data, we partnered with a third-party software developer, Digi.me, to enable participants to obtain their own Facebook data and to send it securely to our research team. In 2020, we invited a subset of the 18,519 NHSII participants (aged 56-73 years) via email to participate. Women were selected if they reported on the 2017-2018 questionnaire that they regularly posted on Facebook and were still active cohort participants. We included an exit survey for those who chose not to participate in order to gauge the reasons for nonparticipation.
   Results: We invited 309 women to participate. Few women signed the consent form (n=52), and only 3 used the Digi.me app to download and transfer their Facebook data. This low participation rate was observed despite modifying our protocol between waves of recruitment, including by (1) excluding active health care workers, who might be less available to participate due to the pandemic, (2) developing a Frequently Asked Questions factsheet to provide more information regarding the protocol, and (3) simplifying the instructions for using the Digi.me app. On our exit survey, the reasons most commonly reported for not participating were concerns regarding data privacy and hesitation sharing personal Facebook posts. The low participation rate suggests that obtaining individual-level Facebook data in a cohort of middle-aged and older women may be challenging.
   Conclusions: In this cohort of midlife and older women who were actively participating for over three decades, we were largely unable to obtain permission to access individual-level data from participants' Facebook accounts. Despite working with a third-party developer to customize an app to implement safeguards for privacy, data privacy remained a key concern in these women. Future studies aiming to leverage individual-level social media data should explore alternate populations or means of sharing social media data.

TI  - Analysis of associations between emotions and activities of drug users and their addiction recovery tendencies from social media posts using structural equation modeling
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
CP  - 8th Workshop on Computational Advances in Molecular Epidemiology (CAME)
AB  - Background Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the significant factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US. Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse.
   Results We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a greater correlation with addiction relapse.
   Conclusions The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first use of structural equation modeling of social media data with the goal of analyzing factors influencing addiction recovery.

We used Twitter to (1) extract negative emotions indicating discomfort in New York City (NYC) before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. We further aimed to (2) identify whether pre- or peri-disaster discomfort were associated with peri- or post-disaster discomfort, respectively, and to (3) assess geographic variation in discomfort across NYC census tracts over time. Our sample consisted of 1,018,140 geo-located tweets that were analyzed with an advanced sentiment analysis called "Extracting the Meaning Of Terse Information in a Visualization of Emotion" (EMOTIVE). We calculated discomfort rates for 2137 NYC census tracts, applied spatial regimes regression to find associations of discomfort, and used Moran's I for spatial cluster detection across NYC boroughs over time. We found increased discomfort, that is, bundled negative emotions after the storm as compared to during the storm. Furthermore, pre- and peri-disaster discomfort was positively associated with post-disaster discomfort; however, this association was different across boroughs, with significant associations only in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. In addition, rates were most prominently spatially clustered in Staten Island lasting pre- to post-disaster. This is the first study that determined significant associations of negative emotional responses found in social media posts over space and time in the context of a natural disaster, which may guide us in identifying those areas and populations mostly in need for care.

TI  - Predicting Public Opinion on Drug Legalization: Social Media Analysis and Consumption Trends
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2019)
CP  - IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)
AB  - In this paper, we focus on the collection and analysis of relevant Twitter data on a state-by-state basis for (i) measuring public opinion on marijuana legalization by mining sentiment in Twitter data and (ii) determining the usage trends for six distinct types of marijuana. We overcome the challenges posed by the informal and ungrammatical nature of tweets to analyze a corpus of 306,835 relevant tweets collected over the four-month period, preceding the November 2015 Ohio Marijuana Legalization ballot and the four months after the election for all states in the US. Our analysis revealed two key insights: (i) the people in states that have legalized recreational marijuana express greater positive sentiments about marijuana than the people in states that have either legalized medicinal marijuana or have not legalized marijuana at all; (ii) the states that have a high percentage of positive sentiment about marijuana is more inclined to authorize (e.g., by allowing medical marijuana) or broaden its legal usage (e.g., by allowing recreational marijuana in addition to medical marijuana). Our analysis shows that social media can provide reliable information and can serve as an alternative to traditional polling of public opinion on drug use and epidemiology research.

TI  - Media and social media attention to retracted articles according to Altmetric
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The number of retracted articles has grown fast. However, the extent to which researchers and the public are made adequately aware of these retractions and how the media and social media respond to them remains unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the media and social media attention received by retracted articles and assess also the attention they receive post-retraction versus pre-retraction. We downloaded all records of retracted literature maintained by the Retraction Watch Database and originally published between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. For all 3,008 retracted articles with a separate DOI for the original and its retraction, we downloaded the respective Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) (from Altmetric) and citation count (from Crossref), for the original article and its retraction notice on June 6, 2018. We also compared the AAS of a random sample of 572 retracted full journal articles available on PubMed to that of unretracted full articles matched from the same issue and journal. 1,687 (56.1%) of retracted research articles received some amount of Altmetric attention, and 165 (5.5%) were even considered popular (AAS>20). 31 (1.0%) of 2,953 with a record on Crossref received >100 citations by June 6, 2018. Popular articles received substantially more attention than their retraction, even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction (Median difference, 29; 95% CI, 17-61). Unreliable results were the most frequent reason for retraction of popular articles (32; 19%), while fake peer review was the most common reason (421; 15%) for the retraction of other articles. In comparison to matched articles, retracted articles tended to receive more Altmetric attention (23/31 matched groups; P-value, 0.01), even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction. Our findings reveal that retracted articles may receive high attention from media and social media and that for popular articles, pre-retraction attention far outweighs post-retraction attention.

TI  - Public Perspectives of Using Social Media Data to Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting: A Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
AB  - Introduction Information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) voluntarily submitted by patients can be a valuable source of information for improving drug safety; however, public awareness of reporting mechanisms remains low. Whilst methods to automatically detect ADR mentions from social media posts using text mining techniques have been proposed to improve reporting rates, it is unclear how acceptable these would be to social media users. Objective The objective of this study was to explore public opinion about using automated methods to detect and report mentions of ADRs on social media to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts. Methods Users of the online health discussion forum HealthUnlocked participated in an online survey (N = 1359) about experiences with ADRs, knowledge of pharmacovigilance methods, and opinions about using automated data mining methods to detect and report ADRs. To further explore responses, five qualitative focus groups were conducted with 20 social media users with long-term health conditions. Results Participant responses indicated a low awareness of pharmacovigilance methods and ADR reporting. They showed a strong willingness to share health-related social media data about ADRs with researchers and regulators, but were cautious about automated text mining methods of detecting and reporting ADRs. Conclusions Social media users value public-facing pharmacovigilance schemes, even if they do not understand the current framework of pharmacovigilance within the UK. Ongoing engagement with users is essential to understand views, share knowledge and respect users' privacy expectations to optimise future ADR reporting from online health communities.

TI  - Social integration of adolescents with chronic pain: a social network analysis
T2  - PAIN
AB  - Adolescents with chronic pain (ACP) often experience impairments in their social functioning. Little is known about the consequences of these impairments on peer relationships of ACP. This study applied social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2), dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3, Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4, standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship qualities moderated the relationship between pain and emotional distress. This study contributes to the literature on the importance of peer relationships of ACP. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Labeled entities from social media data related to avian influenza disease
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - This dataset is composed by spatial (e.g. location) and thematic (e.g. diseases, symptoms, virus) entities concerning avian influenza in social media (textual) data in English. It was created from three corpora: the first one includes 10 transcriptions of YouTube videos and 70 tweets manually annotated. The second corpus is composed by the same textual data but automatically annotated with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools. These two corpora have been built to evaluate NER tools and apply them to a bigger corpus. The third corpus is composed of 100 YouTube transcriptions automatically annotated with NER tools. The aim of the annotation task is to recognize spatial information such as the names of the cities and epidemiological information such as the names of the diseases. An annotation guideline is provided in order to ensure a unified annotation and to help the annotators. This dataset can be used to train or evaluate Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches such as specialized entity recognition. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Social Cohesion During the Stay-at-Home Phase of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Polish-Speaking Twitter
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL DATA AND SOCIAL NETWORKS, CSONET 2021
CP  - 10th International Conference on Computational Data and Social Networks (CSoNet)
AB  - Catastrophic and urgent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are known not only to polarize societies and induce selfish, individualistic behavior, but might also motivate altruistic behavior. We have analyzed COVID-19 perception using data collected from the Polish-language Internet from 15.01-30.06.2020, equaling 930,319 tweets. Deploying methods of computational social science and digital epidemiology, we aim to understand mechanisms of social consolidation and depolarization (measured by network modularity and sentiment) during the so-called "stay-at-home phase" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mauss' theory of interaction or exchange of gifts, the theory of social capital, as well as Kaniasty's theory of mobilization and deterioration serve as a background for reflection on the Polish example during the first epidemic wave. Our study highlights the potential of social support and caretaking to reduce affective and behavioral polarization in social media

TI  - Use of network analysis multidrug-resistant tuberculosis contact investigation in Kanchanaburi, Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To characterise MDR-TB outbreak and incorporate social network analysis with contact investigation to detect case-contact linkages and clusters. Methods MDR-TB cases registered in the district hospital between October 2012 and September 2015 were interviewed and their contacts were investigated. A relationship-based weighted network was constructed. Results Among 43 interviewed MDR-TB cases, 20 (47%) were male, five (12%) were asymptomatic (and discovered incidentally) and 22 (51%) had underlying diseases. From the documented 115 contacts, 61 (53%) were household contacts and 49 (43%) were close (non-household) contacts; 70 (61%) were screened for TB using various tests. In this network, we prioritised 37 contacts connected with more than one MDR-TB patient. The largest cluster was identified in the pharmacy unit of the hospital. Conclusion This investigation yielded a significant number of MDR-TB contacts, and social network analysis facilitated the prioritisation for screening. Social network analysis is useful and feasible in this program setting and complements MDR-TB contact investigation.

TI  - The Role of Social Media Influencers in Public Health Communication: Case COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION
AB  - During public health crises, public organizations face a variety of strategic communication challenges, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is an extreme example. In Finland, the Prime Minister's Office initiated a communication campaign that utilized social media influencers to communicate timely instructions regarding the pandemic. However, it is uncertain how social media influencers adapt to briefings of public organizations given that they typically work with brands that align with their own interests and expertise, which rarely is epidemiology. We use the two-step flow of communication model and social influence theory to analyze research data that consisted of 96 Instagram posts, 108 Instagram Stories and 1097 comments. Qualitative content analysis was used to see how the influencers communicated about the pandemic and how their followers reacted. The results suggest that the influencers tried to adapt the messages to their own style, and, instead of committing to the wordings of the campaign, they shared general guidelines and, with their own example, showed how to behave during the pandemic. Their participation in the campaign helped affect social norms during the time of the crisis, which in the case of public health communication is a substantial, strategic goal.

TI  - Puff or pass: do social media and social interactions influence smoking behaviour of university students? A cross-sectional mixed methods study from Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To determine whether the odds of being a smoker differ based on social media use and social interactions among urban university students in Bangladesh. Hypothesis Social media use and social interactions influence the smoking behaviour of Bangladeshi university students, particularly in starting and maintaining cigarette smoking. Design and setting A cross-sectional study using mixed methods on 600 student smokers and non-smokers recruited from two public and two private universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country with limited resources. Exclusion criteria were those who did not use any form of social media and PhD students. Results Odds of smoking were significantly higher for those who socialised more than 4 hours/day (p<0.05; OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.75) and typically at night (p<0.05; OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.95 to 4.00). Odds of smoking were also higher for those who liked (p<0.05; OR 4.85; 95% CI 3.32 to 7.11), shared (p<0.05; OR 20.50; 95% CI 13.02 to 32.26) and followed (p<0.05; OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.36 to 6.11) tobacco-related content on social media. Qualitative analysis resulted in emergent themes of smokers imitating tobacco-related photos or videos seen on social media and peers as an influence for smoking initiation. Conclusion This study suggests social media and social interactions may influence smoking behaviour in university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Future research should continue to investigate the roles social media and social interaction have on smoking in order to explore social media-based smoking cessation interventions or dissemination of smoking health hazards through social media.

TI  - Associations Between Time Spent Using Social Media and Internalizing and Externalizing Problems Among US Youth
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Social media use may be a risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated this association, and none have quantified the proportion of mental health problems among adolescents attributable to social media use.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether time spent using social media per day is prospectively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of 6595 participants from waves 1 (September 12, 2013, to December 14, 2014), 2 (October 23, 2014, to October 30, 2015), and 3 (October 18, 2015, to October 23, 2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative cohort study of US adolescents, assessed US adolescents via household interviews using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Data analysis was performed from January 14, 2019, to May 22, 2019.
   EXPOSURES Self-reported time spent on social media during a typical day (none, <= 30 minutes, >30 minutes to <= 3 hours, >3 hours to <= 6 hours, and >6 hours) during wave 2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE Self-reported past-year internalizing problems alone, externalizing problems alone, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems during wave 3 using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener.
   RESULTS A total of 6595 adolescents (aged 12-15 years during wave 1; 3400 [51.3%] male) were studied. In unadjusted analyses, spending more than 30 minutes of time on social media, compared with no use, was associated with increased risk of internalizing problems alone (<= 30 minutes: relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94-1.78; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.36-2.64; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.74-3.49; >6 hours: RRR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.88-4.26) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (<= 30 minutes: RRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.83-3.00; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.43-4.09; >6 hours: RRR, 4.29; 95% CI, 3.22-5.73); associations with externalizing problems were inconsistent. In adjusted analyses, use of social media for more than 3 hours per day compared with no use remained significantly associated with internalizing problems alone (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11-2.31; >6 hours: RRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.77) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.51-2.66; >6 hours: RRR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.73-3.43) but not externalizing problems alone.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per day using social media may be at heightened risk for mental health problems, particularly internalizing problems. Future research should determine whether setting limits on daily social media use, increasing media literacy, and redesigning social media platforms are effective means of reducing the burden of mental health problems in this population.

TI  - Acceptability and feasibility of intra-peer and social media approach for HIV self-testing among men who have sex with men in Karachi: lessons from a pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objective:To use a peer-to-peer and social media approach to reach out to men who have sex with men (MSM) and to distribute human immunodeficiency virus self-testing kits among them in an urban setting.Method: The cross-sectional, pilot study was conducted by a community-based organisation in Karachi from November 2020 to February 2021, and comprised men aged 18 years or above who have sex with men. The subjects were provided one human immunodeficiency virus self-testing kit (HIVST) per person by trained outreach workers. It was an oral fluid-based kit. Data related to demographics, behavioural patterns and human immunodeficiency virus testing detail was collected on a structured questionnaire with some open-ended questions. The analysis of qualitative data was done manually, using content analysis technique in which all common responses were grouped that led to the generation of themes.Results: There were 150 male subjects with mean age 31.5+/-8.7 years. Overall, 62(41.3%) subjects had received up to 15 years of formal education, 94(62.6%) were first-time testers; 139(92.7%) performed the test at home; 11(7.3%) used the kit at the community-based organisation's office. In terms of results, 1(0.7%) participant had a reactive result which was later confirmed as positive for human immunodeficiency virus. Of the total, 145(96.6%) participants found the instructions and the kit easy to use on their own, 83(55.3%) preferred a social media-based approach, and 68(45.3%) preferred the peer-to-peer approach. Conclusion: The HIVST was found to be acceptable among men who have sex with men, while peer-led and social media approaches seemed to be an effective method of information dissemination.

TI  - Shaping applied epidemiology workforce training to strengthen emergency response: a global survey of applied epidemiologists, 2019-2020
T2  - HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH
AB  - Background Rapid and effective emergency response to address health security relies on a competent and suitably trained local and international workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied epidemiology workforce. Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020 through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included demographic details of participants, along with their technical background, level of formal education, topics studied during epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi(2)) to test the difference between categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to open-ended questions. Results In total, 282 people responded to the survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74% (n = 210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common. FETP graduates reported higher levels of formal training in all survey topics. Conclusion It is critical for the health security workforce to be well-trained and equipped with skills needed to ensure a rapid and effective response to acute public health events. Leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and specialist training in emergency response are lacking in current training models. Our study has demonstrated that applied epidemiology workforce training must evolve to remain relevant to current and future public health challenges.

TI  - Rural infection preventionists' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from focus groups conducted with association of professionals in infection control & epidemiology (APIC) members
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was identified and quickly developed into a pandemic in spring, 2020. This event posed immense difficulties for healthcare nationally, with rural areas experiencing different challenges than other regions. Methods: The Association of Professionals in Infection Control & Epidemiology conducted focus groups with infection preventionist (IP) members in September and October, 2020. Zoom sessions were recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results: In all, 38 IPs who work at a critical access hospital or a healthcare facility in a rural location participated. Major challenges identified by IPs in this study included addressing the lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE), overwhelming workloads caused by the pandemic and multiple roles/ responsibilities, inaccurate social media messages, and generalized disbelief and disregard about the pandemic among rural community members. Conclusions: Gaps in preparedness identified in this study, such as the lack of PPE, need to be addressed to prevent occupational illness. In addition, health disparities and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 heard by IPs in this study need to be addressed in order to increase compliance with public health safeguards among rural community members and minimize morbidity and mortality in these regions.

TI  - What Remains Now That the Fear Has Passed? Developmental Trajectory Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic for Co-occurrences of Twitter, Google Trends, and Public Health Data
T2  - DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
AB  - Objective:The rapid onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) created a complex virtual collective consciousness. Misinformation and polarization were hallmarks of the pandemic in the United States, highlighting the importance of studying public opinion online. Humans express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before on social media; co-occurrence of multiple data sources have become valuable for monitoring and understanding public sentimental preparedness and response to an event within our society.Methods:In this study, Twitter and Google Trends data were used as the co-occurrence data for the understanding of the dynamics of sentiment and interest during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States from January 2020 to September 2021. Developmental trajectory analysis of Twitter sentiment was conducted using corpus linguistic techniques and word cloud mapping to reveal 8 positive and negative sentiments and emotions. Machine learning algorithms were used to implement the opinion mining how Twitter sentiment was related to Google Trends interest with historical COVID-19 public health data.Results:The sentiment analysis went beyond polarity to detect specific feelings and emotions during the pandemic.Conclusions:The discoveries on the behaviors of emotions at each stage of the pandemic were presented from the emotion detection when associated with the historical COVID-19 data and Google Trends data.

TI  - Using Large-scale Social Media Analytics to Understand Patient Perspectives About Urinary Tract Infections: Thematic Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Current qualitative literature about the experiences of women dealing with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is limited to patients recruited from tertiary centers and medical clinics. However, traditional focus groups and interviews may limit what patients share. Using digital ethnography, we analyzed free-range conversations of an online community.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate and characterize the patient perspectives of women dealing with UTIs using digital ethnography.
   Methods: A data-mining service was used to identify online posts. A thematic analysis was conducted on a subset of the identified posts. Additionally, a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) probabilistic topic modeling method was applied to review the entire data set using a semiautomatic approach. Each identified topic was generated as a discrete distribution over the words in the collection, which can be thought of as a word cloud. We also performed a thematic analysis of the word cloud topic model results.
   Results: A total of 83,589 posts by 53,460 users from 859 websites were identified. Our hand-coding inductive analysis yielded the following 7 themes: quality-of-life impact, knowledge acquisition, support of the online community, health care utilization, risk factors and prevention, antibiotic treatment, and alternative therapies. Using the LDA topic model method, 105 themes were identified and consolidated into 9 categories. Of the LDA-derived themes, 25.7% (27/105) were related to online community support, and 22% (23/105) focused on UTI risk factors and prevention strategies.
   Conclusions: Our large-scale social media analysis supports the importance and reproducibility of using online data to comprehend women's UTI experience. This inductive thematic analysis highlights patient behavior, self-empowerment, and online media utilization by women to address their health concerns in a safe, anonymous way.

TI  - Observations from Social Media Regarding the Symptomatology of Adult Hydrocephalus Patients
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with hydrocephalus experience symptoms related to hydrocephalus in an age-dependent manner. However, prevalence estimates of hydrocephalus symptoms in young and middle-aged (YMA) adult patients are rare and variable. Highlighting the importance of hydrocephalus symptom management, the persistence and intensity of headache or gait disturbance have been associated with signs of brain white matter integrity loss, including in treated YMA adult patients. Thus, it is important to ascertain which symptoms adult patients with hydrocephalus report most to confirm their relative importance.
   METHODS: Observations of symptom complaints were made from publicly viewable online responses to an inquiry posted by the Hydrocephalus Association to 2 Facebook webpages.
   RESULTS: Within 7 days of inquiry posting, 381 complaints of signs and symptoms were identified in 82 online responses. Headache, cognitive deficits (cognition and memory), and mobility issues (dizziness, balance, or gait problems) were most commonly reported by 63%, 45%, and 40% of respondents, respectively. Results were highly similar for the subgroup of 53 patients reported as treated. For self-identified YMA patients (<60 years old), results were similar, but with fewer mobility complaints. Not previously reported, hypersensitivity to external stimuli was reported by one-half of the patients that reported headache.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide further quantitative support for the prioritization of study of headache, cognitive deficits, and mobility issues in YMA adult patients with hydrocephalus. Warranting further study, cranial hypersensitivity to external stimuli may represent a novel outcome measure, and treated YMA adult hydrocephalus patients continue to report symptoms associated with signs of brain damage.

TI  - Identifying discernible indications of psychological well-being using ML: explainable AI in reddit social media interactions
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB  - Psychological well-being is a multidimensional construct and identifying it using a systematic, comprehensive approach offers insights fundamental to critical outcomes. Social networks are valuable resources for research, providing a pragmatic way of generating empirical evidence on psychological well-being based on the textual indicators across different populations. This study analyzed the information on various Reddit social media groups dedicated to mental health. The classes, namely depression, anxiety, bipolar, and SuicideWatch, using the SWMH dataset have been analyzed. The text-based interactions of persons with mental illness have common motifs like negative language and expressions like 'hopelessness,' 'emptiness,' or 'helplessness.' Topic modeling identified recurring themes and subjects that helped classify discernible factors influencing mental health. Classifiers for multiclass classification to classify targeted mental health issues based on users' network behavior and posts were trained and tested to get predictions on context (e.g., MentalBERT) and non-context-based (e.g., LR and NB) models. The MentalBERT model outperformed the other eight baseline models with an average accuracy of 76.70%, which is 4% more than reported in previous studies. Explainable AI was used to examine the trustworthiness of each model, and the explanations were evaluated using the LIME model. Explainability is crucial as mental health data characterizes syndromes, outcomes, disorders, and signs/symptoms exhibiting probabilistic interrelationships with each other. Explanations of these intricate interconnections can assist the extensive research around the model of well-being and interventions intended to improve the human condition and distill positive human functioning.

TI  - Active cannabis marketing and adolescent past-year cannabis use
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
AB  - Methods: Data are from an online survey of 482 adolescents (aged 15-19 years) living in states with legalized retail cannabis. Youth were asked about their engagement with cannabis promotions, including whether they liked/followed cannabis businesses on social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), had a favorite cannabis brand, or could see themselves owning/wearing a cannabis-branded product. Youth also self-reported cannabis use in the past year. We used logistic regression with a Bonferroni correction to compare the odds of cannabis use among youth with different levels of engagement with cannabis promotions and brands after controlling for demographics.
   Results: After adjusting for several possible confounders, youth who liked or followed a cannabis business on at least one social media platform had 5 times higher odds of past-year cannabis use (aOR = 5.00, 95% CI: 2.47, 10.09, p < 0.001). Youth who thought it was likely that they would own or wear cannabis-branded merchandise (aOR = 6.93, 95% CI: 4.45, 10.78, p < 0.001) or who had a favorite cannabis brand (aOR = 7.98, 95% CI: 4.90, 13.00, p < 0.001) had nearly 8 times greater odds of past-year cannabis use.
   Conclusion: Youth who engage with cannabis promotions and brands had higher odds of past-year cannabis use. Jurisdictions with retail cannabis may want to consider restrictions to limit youth engagement with cannabis promotions.

TI  - Social network analysis for better understanding of influenza
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study is to improve the understanding of spatial spreading of complicated cases of influenza that required hospitalizations, by creating heatmaps and social networks. They will allow to identify critical hubs and routes of spreading of Influenza, in specific geographic locations, in order to contain infections and prevent complications, that require hospitalizations.
   Material and methods: Data were downloaded from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) - SID, New York State database. Patients hospitalized with flu complications, between 2003 and 2012 were included in the research (30,380 cases). A novel approach was designed, by constructing heatmaps for specific geographic regions in New York state and power law networks, in order to analyze distribution of hospitalized flu cases.
   Results: Heatmaps revealed that distributions of patients follow urban areas and big roads, indicating that flu spreads along routes, that people use to travel. A scale-free network, created from correlations among zip codes, discovered that, the highest populated zip codes didn't have the largest number of patients with flu complications. Among the top five most affected zip codes, four were in Bronx. Demographics of top affected zip codes were presented in results. Normalized numbers of cases per population revealed that, none of zip codes from Bronx were in the top 20. All zip codes with the highest node degrees were in New York City area.
   Discussion: Heatmaps identified geographic distribution of hospitalized flu patients and network analysis identified hubs of the infection. Our results will enable better estimation of resources for prevention and treatment of hospitalized patients with complications of Influenza.
   Conclusion: Analyses of geographic distribution of hospitalized patients with Influenza and demographic characteristics of populations, help us to make better planning and management of resources for Influenza patients, that require hospitalization. Obtained results could potentially help to save many lives and improve the health of the population.

TI  - Firsthand Opiates Abuse on Social Media: Monitoring Geospatial Patterns of Interest Through a Digital Cohort
T2  - WEB CONFERENCE 2019: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW 2019)
CP  - World Wide Web Conference (WWW)
AB  - In the last decade drug overdose deaths reached staggering proportions in the US. Besides the raw yearly deaths count that is worrisome per se, an alarming picture comes from the steep acceleration of such rate that increased by 21% from 2015 to 2016. While traditional public health surveillance suffers from its own biases and limitations, digital epidemiology offers a new lens to extract signals from Web and Social Media that might be complementary to official statistics. In this paper we present a computational approach to identify a digital cohort that might provide an updated and complementary view on the opioid crisis. We introduce an information retrieval algorithm suitable to identify relevant subspaces of discussion on social media, for mining data from users showing explicit interest in discussions about opioid consumption in Reddit. Moreover, despite the pseudonymous nature of the user base, almost 1.5 million users were geolocated at the US state level, resembling the census population distribution with a good agreement. A measure of prevalence of interest in opiate consumption has been estimated at the state level, producing a novel indicator with information that is not entirely encoded in the standard surveillance. Finally, we further provide a domain specific vocabulary containing informal lexicon and street nomenclature extracted by user-generated content that can be used by researchers and practitioners to implement novel digital public health surveillance methodologies for supporting policy makers in fighting the opioid epidemic.

TI  - Finding Users' Voice on Social Media: An Investigation of Online Support Groups for Autism-Affected Users on Facebook
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The trend towards the use of the Internet for health information purposes is rising. Utilization of various forms of social media has been a key interest in consumer health informatics (CHI). To reveal the information needs of autism-affected users, this study centers on the research of users' interactions and information sharing within autism communities on social media. It aims to understand how autism-affected users utilize support groups on Facebook by applying natural language process (NLP) techniques to unstructured health data in social media. An interactive visualization method (pyLDAvis) was employed to evaluate produced models and visualize the inter-topic distance maps. The revealed topics (e.g., parenting, education, behavior traits) identify issues that individuals with autism were concerned about on a daily basis and how they addressed such concerns in the form of group communication. In addition to general social support, disease-specific information, collective coping strategies, and emotional support were provided as well by group members based on similar personal experiences. This study concluded that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is feasible and appropriated to derive topics (focus) from messages posted to the autism support groups on Facebook. The revealed topics help healthcare professionals (content providers) understand autism from users' perspectives and provide better patient communications.

TI  - Mining twitter to explore the emergence of COVID-19 symptoms
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING
AB  - Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in United States initially alerted the public to three COVID-19 signs and symptoms-fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Concurrent social media posts reflected a wider range of symptoms of COVID-19 besides these three symptoms. Because social media data have a potential application in the early identification novel virus symptoms, this study aimed to explore what symptoms mentioned in COVID-19-related social media posts during the early stages of the pandemic. Methods We collected COVID-19-related Twitter tweets posted in English language between March 30, 2020 and April 19, 2020 using search terms of COVID-19 synonyms and three common COVID-19 symptoms suggested by the CDC in March. Only unique tweets were extracted for analysis of symptom terms. Results A total of 36 symptoms were extracted from 30,732 unique tweets. All the symptoms suggested by the CDC for COVID-19 screening in March, April, and May were mentioned in tweets posted during the early stages of the pandemic. Discussion The findings of this study revealed that many COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned in Twitter tweets earlier than the announcement by the CDC. Monitoring social media data is a promising approach to public health surveillance.

TI  - Fixed orthodontic appliances and adolescents' peer relations in school A social network analysis using cross-sectional survey data
T2  - JOURNAL OF OROFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS-FORTSCHRITTE DER KIEFERORTHOPADIE
AB  - Purpose Studies from the 1970s and 1980s, but also recent investigations on social media suggest that wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance can be a cause of bullying and social exclusion. With the greater uptake of orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable. This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects adolescents' social position in their peer networks using cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about their social relationships in school. These directed network data were used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19% of the surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology, epidemiology and medicine.

TI  - Shared Minds: How Patients Use Collaborative Information Sharing via Social Media Platforms
T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Despite our understanding that social media and online healthcare communities can help to eliminate health information asymmetry and improve patients' self-care engagement, we have yet to understand what happens when patients have access to others' health data and how patients' access to these shared experiences and opinions influence their health knowledge and perceived treatment outcome. In this study, we apply social information processing theory and incorporate (1) uncertainty of a treatment, (2) information exposure, and (3) credibility of the information source into patients' information evaluation function to assess how patients utilize shared health information and experiences. An empirical model, which combines various aspects of patients' firsthand experiences about treatments into a single construct, yields empirical evidence that patients' perceived treatment outcome is prone to social influence from other patients' shared experiences. By disaggregating the sources of social influence, we find that social influence created by generalized others in the community outweighs that by familiar others of one's intimate social group. In addition, we find that other factors, such as positive sentiment in comments and patients' prior experiences, also affect patients' perceived treatment outcome. Based on our findings, implications for health promotion and health behaviors are presented.

TI  - Combining Social Media and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to Detect Adverse Drug Reactions
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
AB  - Introduction Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unintended reactions caused by a drug or combination of drugs taken by a patient. The current safety surveillance system relies on spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) and more recently on observational health data; however, ADR detection may be delayed and lack geographic diversity. The broad scope of social media conversations, such as those on Twitter, can include health-related topics. Consequently, these data could be used to detect potentially novel ADRs with less latency. Although research regarding ADR detection using social media has made progress, findings are based on single information sources, and no study has yet integrated drug safety evidence from both an SRS and Twitter. Objective The aim of this study was to combine signals from an SRS and Twitter to facilitate the detection of safety signals and compare the performance of the combined system with signals generated by individual data sources. Methods We extracted potential drug-ADR posts from Twitter, used Monte Carlo expectation maximization to generate drug safety signals from both the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and posts from Twitter, and then integrated these signals using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The results from the integrated system and two individual sources were evaluated using a reference standard derived from drug labels. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was computed to measure performance. Results We observed a significant improvement in the AUC of the combined system when comparing it with Twitter alone, and no improvement when comparing with the SRS alone. The AUCs ranged from 0.587 to 0.637 for the combined SRS and Twitter, from 0.525 to 0.534 for Twitter alone, and from 0.612 to 0.642 for the SRS alone. The results varied because different preprocessing procedures were applied to Twitter. Conclusion The accuracy of signal detection using social media can be improved by combining signals with those from SRSs. However, the combined system cannot achieve better AUC performance than data from FAERS alone, which may indicate that Twitter data are not ready to be integrated into a purely data-driven combination system.

TI  - Role of Incentives in the Use of Blockchain-Based Platforms for Sharing Sensitive Health Data: Experimental Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables secure and decentralized approaches to reduce technical risks and governance challenges associated with sharing data. Although blockchain-based solutions have been suggested for sharing health information, it is still unclear whether a suitable incentive mechanism (intrinsic or extrinsic) can be identified to encourage individuals to share their sensitive data for research purposes.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate how important extrinsic incentives are and what type of incentive is the best option in blockchain-based platforms designed for sharing sensitive health information.
   Methods: In this study, we conducted 3 experiments with 493 individuals to investigate the role of extrinsic incentives (ie, cryptocurrency, money, and recognition) in data sharing with research organizations.
   Results: The findings highlight that offering different incentives is insufficient to encourage individuals to use blockchain technology or to change their perceptions about the technology's premise for sharing sensitive health data. The results demonstrate that individuals still attribute serious risks to blockchain-based platforms. Privacy and security concerns, trust issues, lack of knowledge about the technology, lack of public acceptance, and lack of regulations are reported as top risks. In terms of attracting people to use blockchain-based platforms for data sharing in health care, we show that the effects of extrinsic motivations (cryptoincentives, money, and status) are significantly overshadowed by inhibitors to technology use.
   Conclusions: We suggest that before emphasizing the use of various types of extrinsic incentives, the users must be educated about the capabilities and benefits offered by this technology. Thus, an essential first step for shifting from an institution-based data exchange to a patient-centric data exchange (using blockchain) is addressing technology inhibitors to promote patient-driven data access control. This study shows that extrinsic incentives alone are inadequate to change users' perceptions, increase their trust, or encourage them to use technology for sharing health data.

TI  - Pharmacology and social media: Potentials and biases of web forums for drug mention analysis-case study of France
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze drug mentions in web forums to evaluate the utility of this data source for drug post-marketing studies. We automatically annotated over 60 million posts extracted from 21 French web forums. Drug mentions detected in this corpus were matched to drug names in a French drug database (Theriaque (R)). Our analysis showed that a high proportion of the most frequent drug mentions in the selected web forums correspond to drugs that are usually prescribed to young women, such as combined oral contraceptives. The most mentioned drugs in our corpus correlated weakly to the most prescribed drugs in France but seemed to be influenced by events widely reported in traditional media. In this article, we conclude that web forums have high potential for post-marketing drug-related studies, such as pharmacovigilance, and observation of drug utilization. However, the bias related to forum selection and the corresponding population representativeness should always be taken into account.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and sociodemo-graphic correlates of cyberbullying victimization and perpetra-tion among a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population-based sample of 11-12-year-old early adolescents.METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Adoles-cent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (Year 2; N = 9429). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors (sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, country of birth, household income, parental education) and adolescent-reported cyberbul-lying victimization and perpetration.RESULTS: In the overall sample, lifetime prevalence of cyber-bullying victimization was 9.6%, with 65.8% occurring in the past 12 months, while lifetime prevalence of cyberbullying per-petration was 1.1%, with 59.8% occurring in the past 12 months. Boys reported higher odds of cyberbullying perpetration (AOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.92) but lower odds of cyberbullying victimization (AOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.94) than girls. Sexual minorities reported 2.83 higher odds of cyberbullying victimiza-tion (95% CI 1.69-4.75) than nonsexual minorities. Lower household income was associated with 1.64 (95% CI 1.34 -2.00) higher odds of cyberbullying victimization than higher household income, however household income was not associ-ated with cyberbullying perpetration. Total screen time, particu-larly on the internet and social media, was associated with both cyberbullying victimization and perpetration.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in 10 early adolescents reported cyberbullying victimization. Pediatricians, parents, teachers, and online platforms can provide education to support victims and prevent perpetration for early adolescents at the highest risk of cyberbullying.

TI  - Insights from Social Media on the Patient Experience of Living With Rare Eosinophil-Driven Diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE
AB  - Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) are driven by persistently high eosinophil numbers, causing damage to tissues and organs. As rare diseases, they are often underappreciated by healthcare professionals. Using a social listening analysis, we collected patient and caregiver comments relating to EGPA and HES made on online social platforms between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2020, in English, French, and German. Results were classified into key areas of interest. In total, 746 comments with consent to publish were collected mentioning EGPA, and 39 were identified mentioning HES. The most common theme was sharing of personal experiences (EGPA: 77%; HES: 100%). Diagnosis, including diagnosis delays and misdiagnosis, was mentioned in 33% of comments for EGPA, and 82% for HES. Other common themes included seeking and giving advice, symptoms, and treatments. These insights highlight the views and unmet needs of people living with EGPA and HES. Further work should improve disease awareness and effective communications among healthcare professionals and patients with these conditions.

TI  - Personal Health Mention Identification from Tweets Using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (IEEE IEEM)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)
AB  - The past decade witnesses the unprecedent growth of social media users worldwide. People express health related outcomes, information, and views on social media platforms. This provides many opportunities to utilize the data source for health monitoring and surveillance, and digital epidemiology in real time. Personal health mention (PHM) is among one of the critical tasks for such purpose. It tries to identify whether a person's health condition is mentioned in a sentence. However, social media texts contain noises, many creative and novel phrases, sarcastic Emoji expressions, and misspellings. This poses challenges to detect PHM from social media text. This paper explores the PHM identification task for six diseases from twitter using convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, word embeddings are used to encode the twitter text. Then they are fed into CNN structure to train the classifier for PHM identification. We also explore how the performance of different methods are affected by data imbalance issue and training sample size.

TI  - Using Patient-Generated Health Data From Twitter to Identify, Engage, and Recruit Cancer Survivors in Clinical Trials in Los Angeles County: Evaluation of a Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Failure to find and attract clinical trial participants remains a persistent barrier to clinical research. Researchers increasingly complement recruitment methods with social media-based methods. We hypothesized that user-generated data from cancer survivors and their family members and friends on the social network Twitter could be used to identify, engage, and recruit cancer survivors for cancer trials.
   Objective: This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of using user-reported health data from cancer survivors and family members and friends on Twitter in Los Angeles (LA) County to enhance clinical trial recruitment. We focus on 6 cancer conditions (breast cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer).
   Methods: The social media intervention involved monitoring cancer-specific posts about the 6 cancer conditions by Twitter users in LA County to identify cancer survivors and their family members and friends and contacting eligible Twitter users with information about open cancer trials at the University of Southern California (USC) Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. We reviewed both retrospective and prospective data published by Twitter users in LA County between July 28, 2017, and November 29, 2018. The study enrolled 124 open clinical trials at USC Norris. We used descriptive statistics to report the proportion of Twitter users who were identified, engaged, and enrolled.
   Results: We analyzed 107,424 Twitter posts in English by 25,032 unique Twitter users in LA County for the 6 cancer conditions. We identified and contacted 1.73% (434/25,032) of eligible Twitter users (127/434, 29.3% cancer survivors; 305/434, 70.3% family members and friends; and 2/434, 0.5% Twitter users were excluded). Of them, 51.4% (223/434) were female and approximately one-third were male. About one-fifth were people of color, whereas most of them were White. Approximately one-fifth (85/434, 19.6%) engaged with the outreach messages (cancer survivors: 33/85, 38% and family members and friends: 52/85, 61%). Of those who engaged with the messages, one-fourth were male, the majority were female, and approximately one-fifth were people of color, whereas the majority were White. Approximately 12% (10/85) of the contacted users requested more information and 40% (4/10) set up a prescreening. Two eligible candidates were transferred to USC Norris for further screening, but neither was enrolled.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential of identifying and engaging cancer survivors and their family members and friends on Twitter. Optimization of downstream recruitment efforts such as screening for digital populations on social media may be required. Future research could test the feasibility of the approach for other diseases, locations, languages, social media platforms, and types of research involvement (eg, survey research). Computer science methods could help to scale up the analysis of larger data sets to support more rigorous testing of the intervention.

TI  - Persisting Effects of a Social Media Campaign to Prevent Indoor Tanning: A Randomized Trial
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
AB  - Background: A social media campaign for mothers aimed at reducing indoor tanning (IT) by adolescent daughters reduced mothers' permissiveness toward IT in an immediate posttest. Whether the effects persisted at 6 months after the campaign remains to be determined.
   Methods: Mothers (N = 869) of daughters ages 14-17 in 34 states without bans on IT byminors were enrolled in a randomized trial. All mothers received an adolescent health campaign over 12months with posts on preventing IT (intervention) or prescription drug misuse (control). Mothers completed a follow-up at 18 months postrandomization measuring IT permissiveness, attitudes, intentions, communication, and behavior, and support for state bans. Daughters (n = 469; 54.0%) just completed baseline and follow-up surveys.
   Results: Structural equation modeling showed that intervention-group mothers were less permissive of IT by daughters [unstandardized coefficient, -0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.31 to -0.03], had greater self-efficacy to refuse daughter's IT requests (0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.29) and lower IT intentions themselves (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01), and were more supportive of bans on IT by minors (0.23; 95% CI, 0.02-0.43) than control-group mothers. Intervention-group daughters expressed less positive IT attitudes than controls (-0.16; 95% CI, 0.31 to -0.01).
   Conclusions: The social media campaign may have had a persisting effect of convincing mothers to withhold permission for daughters to indoor tan for 6 months after its conclusion. Reduced IT intentions and increased support for bans on IT by minors also persisted among mothers.
   Impact: Social media may increase support among mothers to place more restrictions on IT by minors.

TI  - Challenges and perspectives for the future of diabetes epidemiology in the era of digital health and artificial intelligence
T2  - DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Digital health data, for example from social media or connected devices, as well as the artificial intelligence methods to analyze them, are profoundly changing the way we approach research in diabetes epidemiology. The concepts of deep digital phenotyping and digital twins, which are based on the development of large cohort studies of extremely well characterized people with diabetes, will make it possible to further personalize the monitoring and management of the disease, thanks to a better integration of the impact of diabetes on people's daily lives. Similarly, the development of digital biomarkers, such as vocal biomarkers, will improve the remote monitoring of people with diabetes and thus allow the development of the telemonitoring and telemedicine of the future. These new opportunities are promising but they also come with their share of technical and ethical challenges that should not be overlooked.(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Using communication networks to assess the level of sharing of wildlife health data and information among wildlife professionals in Ontario, Canada
T2  - HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE
AB  - There is a need for wildlife professionals to work together to more effectively protect wildlife health; however, collaboration between people of different professions and institutions can be challenging. Our objective was to examine and compare how the conservation and animal health fields share wildlife health data and information in Ontario, Canada. Fifty-five (50%) of 110 invited participants completed an online questionnaire about their wildlife health communication network over the previous 12 months. The professional communication networks (i.e., ego-networks) of practitioners were compared with respect to data sharing between institutions and professions. Results showed low levels of tie dispersion and high levels of ego-alter similarity. There was more data and information sharing occurring between people of different institutions than between people of different professions based on comparing tie dispersion and ego-alter similarity values for these categories. This study highlights opportunities for improved networking between wildlife conservation and health practitioners in Ontario.

TI  - Jeelo Dobara (Live Life Again): a cross-sectional survey to understand the use of social media and community experience and perceptions around COVID-19 vaccine uptake in three low vaccine uptake districts in Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To gather preliminary insights through formative research on social media usage, and experiences, attitudes and perceptions around COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination in three high-risk, underserved districts in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Design Cross-sectional mixed-method design.
   Participants 392 adults (361 surveys and 30 in-depth interviews (IDI)) from districts South, East and Korangi in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Main outcome measures Social media usage and knowledge, perception and behaviour towards COVID-19 infection and vaccination.
   Results Using social media was associated with an increased probability of getting vaccinated by 1.61 units. Most of the respondents (65%) reported using social media, mainly to watch videos and/or keep in touch with family/friends. 84.76% knew of COVID-19 while 88.37% knew about the COVID-19 vaccination, with 71.19% reported vaccine receipt; reasons to vaccinate included belief that vaccines protect from the virus, and vaccination being mandatory for work. However, only 56.7% of respondents believed they were at risk of disease. Of the 54 unvaccinated individuals, 27.78% did not vaccinate as they did not believe in COVID-19. Despite this, 78.38% of respondents scored high on vaccine confidence. In IDIs, most respondents knew about COVID-19 vaccines: 'This vaccine will create immunity in your body. Therefore, I think we should get vaccinated', and over half knew how COVID-19 spreads. Most considered COVID-19 a serious public health problem and thought it important that people get vaccinated. However, there was a low-risk perception of self as only a little over half felt that they were at risk of contracting COVID-19.
   Conclusion With our conflicting results regarding COVID-19 vaccine confidence, that is, high vaccine coverage but low perception of risk to self, it is likely that vaccine coverage is more a result of mandates and coercion than true vaccine confidence. Our findings imply that interactive social media could be valuable in fostering provaccine sentiment.

TI  - Public engagement with health data governance: the role of visuality
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Over the last years, public engagement has become a topic of scholarly and policy debate particularly in biomedicine, a field that increasingly centres around collecting, sharing and analysing personal data. However, the use of big data in biomedicine poses specific challenges related to gaining public support for health data usage in research and clinical settings. The improvement of public engagement practices in health data governance is widely recognised as critical to address this issue. Based on OECD guidance, public engagement serves to enhance transparency and accountability, and enable citizens to actively participate in shaping what affects their lives. For health research initiatives, this provides a way to cultivate cooperation and build public trust. Today, the exact formats of public engagement have evolved to include approaches (such as social media, events and websites) that exploit visualisation mediated by emerging information and communication technologies. Much scholarship acknowledges the advantages of visuality for public engagement, particularly in information-dense and digital contexts. However, little research has examined how health data governance actors utilise visuality to promote clarity, understandability and audience participation. Beyond simply acknowledging the diversity of possible formats, attention must also be paid to visualisations' rhetorical capacity to convey arguments and ideas and motivate particular audiences in specific situations. This paper seeks to address this gap by analysing both the approaches and methods of argumentation used in two visual public engagement campaigns. Based on Gottweis' analytical framework of argumentative performativity, this paper explores how two European public engagement facilitators construct contending narratives in efforts to make sense of and grapple with the challenges of health data sharing. Specifically, we analyse how their campaigns employ the three rhetorical elements logos, ethos and pathos, proposed by Gottweis to assess communicative practices, intermediated and embedded in symbolically rich social and cultural contexts. In doing so, we highlight how visual techniques of argumentation seek to bolster engagement but vary with rhetorical purposes, as while one points to health data sharing risks, the other focuses on benefits. Moreover, drawing on digital and visual anthropology, we reflect on how the digitalisation of communicative practices impacts visual power.

TI  - Dynamic Network of Interactions in the Wildlife-Livestock Interface in Mediterranean Spain: An Epidemiological Point of View
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - The correct management of diseases that are transmitted between wildlife and livestock requires a reliable estimate of the pathogen transmission rate. The calculation of this parameter is a challenge for epidemiologists, since transmission can occur through multiple pathways. The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16 proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions, including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within this network. The results show a high connection between species through indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock. The present work shows the need to consider different types of methodologies in order to understand the complete functioning of the network of interactions at the wildlife/livestock interface. It also provides a methodological approach applicable to the management of shared diseases.

T2  - QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH
AB  - AimTo explore the perspectives, experience, and concerns of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in China.MethodsWe used data mining to investigate posts shared in Baidu Tieba concerned with IBS; we collected the data through the crawler code, and mined the cleaned data's themes based on Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the Grounded theory.ResultsWe found 5746 network posts related to IBS. LDA analysis generated 20 topics, and grounded theory analysis established eight topics. Combining the two methods, we finally arranged the topics according to five concepts: difficulty in obtaining disease information; serious psychosocial problems; dissatisfied with the treatment; lack of social support; and low quality of life.ConclusionSocial media research improved patient-centric understanding of patients' experiences and perceptions. Our study may facilitate doctor-patient communication and assist in the formulation of medical policies.

TI  - Empowering machine learning models with contextual knowledge for enhancing the detection of eating disorders in social media posts
T2  - SEMANTIC WEB
AB  - Social networks have become information dissemination channels, where announcements are posted frequently; they also serve as frameworks for debates in various areas (e.g., scientific, political, and social). In particular, in the health area, social networks represent a channel to communicate and disseminate novel treatments' success; they also allow ordinary people to express their concerns about a disease or disorder. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has developed analytical methods to uncover and predict patterns from posts that enable it to explain news about a particular topic, e.g., mental disorders expressed as eating disorders or depression. Albeit potentially rich while expressing an idea or concern, posts are presented as short texts, preventing, thus, AI models from accurately encoding these posts' contextual knowledge. We propose a hybrid approach where knowledge encoded in community-maintained knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata) is combined with deep learning to categorize social media posts using existing classification models. The proposed approach resorts to state-of-the-art named entity recognizers and linkers (e.g., Falcon 2.0) to extract entities in short posts and link them to concepts in knowledge graphs. Then, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) are utilized to compute latent representations of the extracted entities, which result in vector representations of the posts that encode these entities' contextual knowledge extracted from the knowledge graphs. These KGEs are combined with contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT) to generate a context-based representation of the posts that empower prediction models. We apply our proposed approach in the health domain to detect whether a publication is related to an eating disorder (e.g., anorexia or bulimia) and uncover concepts within the discourse that could help healthcare providers diagnose this type of mental disorder. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders. Our experimental results suggest that combining contextual knowledge encoded in word embeddings with the one built from knowledge graphs increases the reliability of the predictive models. The ambition is that the proposed method can support health domain experts in discovering patterns that may forecast a mental disorder, enhancing early detection and more precise diagnosis towards personalized medicine.

TI  - Health Information in the Era of Social Media: An Analysis of the Nature and Accuracy of Posts Made by Public Facebook Pages for Patients with Endometriosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Study Objective: To analyze the nature and accuracy of social media (Facebook) content related to endometriosis.
   Design: Retrospective content analysis. Setting: Social media platform, Facebook.
   Participants: Social media posts on Facebook endometriosis pages.
   Interventions: A search of public Facebook pages was performed using the key word "endometriosis." Posts from the month-long study period were categorized and analyzed for accuracy. Two independent researchers used thematic evaluation to place posts into the following 11 categories: educational, emotional support, advocacy, discussion, events, humor, promotional, recipes, resources, surveys, and other. Posts categorized as educational were further subcategorized and reviewed. Each posted fact was cross-referenced in peer-reviewed scientific journals to determine whether the claim made was evidence-based. Engagement in a post was calculated by taking the sum of comments, shares, and reactions.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 53 Facebook pages meeting inclusion criteria were identified and 1464 posts from the study period were evaluated. Emotional support posts comprised the largest category of posts (48%) followed by educational posts (21%). Within the educational category, the epidemiology and pathophysiology subcategory comprised the largest group (42.0%) followed by the symptom's subcategory (19.6%). Post category had an effect on the amount of post engagement (p-value <.001) with emotional posts generating 70% of the overall engagement. The subcategories of the educational posts demonstrated a similar effect on engagement (p-value <.001). Posts were more engaging if they contained epidemiology and pathophysiology information with 44% of all engagement of educational posts occurring within this subcategory. Educational posts were found to be 93.93% accurate. There was no correlation between post engagement and post information accuracy (p-value = .312).
   Conclusion: Facebook pages offer emotional support and education to people with endometriosis. Most information found in these Facebook pages is evidence-based. Clinicians should consider discussing the use of Facebook pages with their patients diagnosed with endometriosis. (C) 2021 AAGL. All rights reserved.

It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data. Besides, the public, who is the data source, always expects the security, privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can avoid contributing their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as the public is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of precision health diminishes. Herein, in the light of precision health data security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the best methods and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and thus precision health is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs. Then it presents the requirements and investigates the associated challenges. Secondly, this paper investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine learning methods suitable for the computation of precision health data along with their usage in relevant health projects. Finally, it illustrates the best available techniques for precision health data security and privacy with a conceptual system model that enables compliance, ethics clearance, consent management, medical innovations, and developments in the health domain.

TI  - Mining Multiplatform Opinions During Public Health Crisis: A Comparative Study
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases pose a growing threat to human society and have sparked extensive public discussions on social media. Although numerous efforts have been made in health data mining on social media, there is a lack of focus on quantitative comparisons across multiple platforms, despite their crucial role in the holistic social communication system. This study addresses this gap by developing a generalized regression model that considers the distinct attributes of social media platforms, including short-text, long-text, and Eastern or Western orientation. Using Monkeypox as an application case, this study examines differences among platforms based on four factors: user characteristics, text topics, text emotion, and text quality. The modeling and regression results reveal significant heterogeneity in public opinion expressions across different platforms, particularly between long-text and short-text platforms. Users on short-text platforms are more exposed to diverse information and tend to be susceptible to emotionally provocative content. On the other hand, users on long-text platforms prefer in-depth discussions and show greater receptivity to content infused with positive emotions. This study reveals the information bias brought by platform differences and contributes to data-driven modeling in social communication systems.

TI  - Relationships between abstract features and methodological quality explained variations of social media activity derived from systematic reviews about psoriasis interventions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship among abstract structure, readability, and completeness, and how these features may influence social media activity and bibliometric results, considering systematic reviews (SRs) about interventions in psoriasis classified by methodological quality.
   Study Design and Setting: Systematic literature searches about psoriasis interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review, methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension, structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media diffusion.
   Results: We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality: a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower quality.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader social media visibility and article usage.

TI  - An annotated data set for identifying women reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on Twitter
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Despite the prevalence in the United States of miscarriage [1] stillbirth [2], and infant mortality associated with preterm birth and low birthweight [3], their causes remain largely unknown [4-6]. To advance the use of social media data as a complementary resource for epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we present a data set of 6487 tweets that mention miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or premature labor, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care, or fetal/infant loss in general. These tweets are a subset of 22,912 tweets retrieved by applying hand-written regular expressions to a database containing more than 400 million public tweets posted by more than 100,000 women who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter [7]. Two professional annotators labeled the 6487 tweets in a binary fashion, distinguishing those potentially reporting that the user has personally experienced the outcome ("outcome" tweets) from those that merely mention the outcome ("non-outcome" tweets). Inter-annotator agreement was kappa = 0.90 (Cohen's kappa). The tweets annotated as "outcome" include 1318 women reporting miscarriage, 94 stillbirth, 591 preterm birth or premature labor, 171 low birthweight, 453 neonatal intensive care, and 356 fetal/infant loss in general. These "outcome" tweets can be used to explore patient experiences and perceptions of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can direct researchers to the users' broader timelines-tweets posted by a user over time for observational studies. Our past work demonstrates the analysis of timelines for selecting a study population [8] and conducting a case-control study [9] of users reporting that their child has a birth defect. For larger-scale studies, the full annotated corpus can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically identify additional users reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on Twitter. We used the annotated corpus to train feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers presented in "A natural language processing pipeline to advance the use of Twitter data for digital epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes" [10].

TI  - User Privacy, Surveillance and Public Health during COVID-19-An Examination of Twitterverse
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB  - Online users frequently rely on social networking platforms to transmit public concerns and raise awareness about societal issues. With many government organizations actively employing social media data in recent times, the need for processing public concerns on social media has become a critical topic of interest across academic scholars and practitioners. However, the growing volume of social media data makes it difficult to process all the issues under a single umbrella, causing to overlook the main topic of interest within communication technologies, such as privacy. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, arguments on privacy and health issues exploded on Twitter, with several threads centered on contact tracking, health data gathering, and its usage by government agencies. To address the challenges of rising data volumes and to understand the importance of privacy concerns, particularly among users seeking greater privacy protection during this pandemic, we conduct a focused empirical analysis of user tweets about privacy. In this two-part research, our first study reveals three macro privacy issues of discussion distilled from the Twitter corpus, subsequently subdivided into 12 user privacy categories. The second study builds on the findings of the first study, focusing on the primary difficulties highlighted in the macro privacy subjects-contact tracing and digital surveillance. Using a document clustering approach, we present implications for the focal privacy topics that policymakers, agencies, and governments should consider for offering better privacy protections and help the community rebuild.

TI  - Rugby Health and Well-Being Study: protocol for a UK-wide survey with health data cross-validation
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Rugby football (Union and League) provides physical activity (PA) with related physical and mental health benefits. However, as a collision sport, rugby research and media coverage predominantly focus on injuries in elite players while the overall impact on health and well-being remains unclear. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of rugby participation in a diverse sample of men and women, current and former rugby Union and League players from recreational to the elite level of play. We will explore: (1) joint-specific injuries and concussion; (2) joint pain and osteoarthritis (OA); (3) medical and mental health conditions; (4) PA and sedentary behaviour and (5) well-being (quality of life, flourishing and resilience). Methods and analysis The Rugby Health and Well-being Study is designed in two phases: (1) a UK-wide cross-sectional survey and (2) cross-validation using health register data from Scotland. Participants will be at least 16 years old, current or former rugby players who have played rugby for at least one season. We will report standardised, level of play-, sex- and age-stratified prevalence of joint injury, concussion, medical conditions and PA. We will describe injury/concussion prevention expectations and protective equipment use. Rugby-related factors associated with injury, pain, OA, PA, health and well-being will be explored in regression models. We will compare joint pain intensity and duration, elements of pain perception and well-being between recreational and elite players and further investigate these associations in regression models while controlling for confounding variables. In the second phase, we will validate self-reported with health register data, and provide further information on healthcare use. Ethics and dissemination The Yorkshire and the Humber-Leeds East Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 19/HY/0377) has approved this study (IRAS project ID 269424). The results will be disseminated through scientific publications, conferences and social media.

TI  - Attitudes of Covid-19 patients toward sharing their health data: A survey-based study to understand security and privacy concerns
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Background and AimsMany people around the world, especially at the time of the Covid-19 outbreak, are concerned about their e-health data. The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of patients with Covid-19 toward sharing their health data for research and their concerns about security and privacy. MethodsThis survey is a cross-sectional study conducted through an electronic researcher-made questionnaire from February to May 2021. Convenience sampling was applied to select the participants and all 475 patients were referred to two to Afzalipour and Shahid Bahonar hospitals were invited to the study. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 204 patients were included in the study and completed the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, and standard deviation) were used to analyze the questionnaire data. SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. ResultsParticipants tended to share information about "comments provided by individuals on websites" (68.6%), "fitness tracker data" (64.19%), and "online shopping history" (63.21%) before death. Participants also tended to share information about "electronic medical records data" (36.75%), "genetic data" (24.99%), and "Instagram data" (24.99%) after death. "Fraud or misuse of personal information" (4.48 [+/- 1.27]) was the most common concern of participants regarding the virtual world. "Unauthorized access to the account" (4.38 [+/- 0.73]), "violation of the privacy of personal information" (4.26 [+/- 0.85]), and "violation of the patient privacy and personal information confidentially" (4.26 [+/- 0.85]) were the most of the unauthorized security incidents that occurred online for participants. ConclusionPatients with Covid-19 were concerned about releasing information they shared on websites and social networks. Therefore, people should be made aware of the reliability of websites and social media so that their security and privacy are not affected.

TI  - Use of Twitter social media activity as a proxy for human mobility to predict the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 at global scale
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
AB  - As of February 27, 2020, 82,294 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported since December 2019, including 2,804 deaths, with cases reported throughout China, as well as in 45 international locations outside of mainland China. We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID-19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19.
   Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. <= 0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID-19 response plans as soon as permitting.

TI  - Search engines, news wires and digital epidemiology: Presumptions and facts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Digital epidemiology tries to identify diseases dynamics and spread behaviors using digital traces collected via search engines logs and social media posts. However, the impacts of news on information-seeking behaviors have been remained unknown.
   Methods: Data employed in this research provided from two sources, (1) Parsijoo search engine query logs of 48 months, and (2) a set of documents of 28 months of Parsijoo's news service. Two classes of topics, i.e. macrotopics and micro-topics were selected to be tracked in query logs and news. Keywords of the macro-topics were automatically generated using web provided resources and exceeded 10k. Keyword set of micro-topics were limited to a numerable list including terms related to diseases and health-related activities. The tests are established in the form of three studies. Study A includes temporal analyses of 7 macro-topics in query logs. Study B considers analyzing seasonality of searching patterns of 9 micro-topics, and Study C assesses the impact of news media coverage on users' health-related information-seeking behaviors.
   Results: Study A showed that the hourly distribution of various macro-topics followed the changes in social activity level. Conversely, the interestingness of macro-topics did not follow the regulation of topic distributions. Among macro-topics, "Pharmacotherapy" has highest interestingness level and wider time-window of popularity. In Study B, seasonality of a limited number of diseases and health-related activities were analyzed. Trends of infectious diseases, such as flu, mumps and chicken pox were seasonal. Due to seasonality of most of diseases covered in national vaccination plans, the trend belonging to "Immunization and Vaccination" was seasonal, as well. Cancer awareness events caused peaks in search trends of "Cancer" and "Screening" micro-topics in specific days of each year that mimic repeated patterns which may mistakenly be identified as seasonality. In study C, we assessed the co-integration and correlation between news and query trends. Our results demonstrated that microtopics sparsely covered in news media had lowest level of impressiveness and, subsequently, the lowest impact on users' intents.
   Conclusion: Our results can reveal public reaction to social events, diseases and prevention procedures. Furthermore, we found that news trends are co-integrated with search queries and are able to reveal health-related events; however, they cannot be used interchangeably. It is recommended that the user-generated contents and news documents are analyzed mutually and interactively.

T2  - 2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY, ISTAS
CP  - 29th Annual IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS)
AB  - The unfolding of the COVID-19 outbreak was an unprecedented and unanticipated opportunity to understand how a sudden global shock modulates people's online searches when seeking information about their emotional well-being. It has also illustrated how public health surveillance systems were essential for tracking diseases' spatial and temporal dynamics and shaping rapid public policy changes.
   The present paper validates a data mining and processing framework which examines how digital epidemiology and machine learning reveal trends in human mental health and psychological distress expression variability. We present results obtained in two research exploring the relationship between Google Trends time-series in the digital surveillance of search engines during the pandemic and a selection of social media feeds and official UK well-being surveys.
   The generated body of evidence shows how data science can provide robust, finely grained, and replicable evidence on mental health measures at the population level. In the future, the digital surveillance analytics validated here can be rapidly deployed for crisis management and allow early detection of distress signals to better manage communication and policy action at population level.

TI  - Social network analysis and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate disease transmission in a large, dynamic population: A study of avian mycobacteriosis in zoo birds
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study combined a social network analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test for general patterns of contagious spread of a mycobacterial infection for which pathways of disease acquisition are not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430 birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.

TI  - Ethical Views on Sharing Digital Data for Public Health Surveillance: Analysis of Survey Data Among Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
AB  - Digital data, including social media, wearable device data, electronic health records, and internet search data, are increasingly being integrated into public health research and policy. Because of the current issues around public distrust of science and other ethical issues in public health research, it is essential that researchers conduct ongoing studies assessing people's perceptions around and willingness to share digital data. This study aims to examine participants' social media use and comfort sharing their data with health researchers. One hundred and sixty-one participants with medical conditions were recruited through social media paid advertisements and referral from a website, and invited to complete surveys on social media use and ethical perspectives on data sharing. Eligibility criteria were adults 18 years old or older, living in the US, self-reported having been diagnosed by a physician with a medical condition, belonging to at least one social media platform, using social media at least twice a week, and owning a smartphone. Study participants were mostly female, White, and with a mean age of 36.31 years. More than one third of participants reported being very comfortable sharing electronic health data and social media data for personalized healthcare and to help others. Findings suggest that participants are very uncomfortable sharing their location and text message data with researchers, with primary concerns centered around loss of privacy, disclosing private information, and that friends, family, and others may find out that they shared text messages with researchers. We discuss the implications of this research before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, along with its potential implications for future collection of digital data for public health.

TI  - Evaluation of Hybrid Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning Approach to Detect Self-Reporting of COVID-19 Symptoms on Twitter
T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (ICC WORKSHOPS)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
AB  - With over 127 million cases globally, the COVID-19 pandemic marks a sentinel event in global health. However, true case estimations have been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity, asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care. Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize, and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also evaluated model performance. From 4,492,954 tweets collected, the unsupervised learning process yielded 3,465 (<1%) symptom tweets used to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11,550). The XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62) compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in identification of an additional 2,622 symptom-related tweets when applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected. Our study used a hybrid machine learning approach to enable high precision identification of Twitter usergenerated COVID-19 symptom discussions. The model is a digital epidemiology tool that can identify social media users who selfreport symptoms during the early periods of an outbreak.

TI  - What users' musical preference on Twitter reveals about psychological disorders
T2  - INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Previous research found a strong relation between the users' psychological disorders and their language use in social media posts in terms of vocabulary selection, emotional expressions, and psychometric attributes. However, although studying the association between psychological disorders and musical preference is considered as rather an old tradition in the clinical analysis of health data, it is not explored through the lens of social media analytics. In this study, we investigate which attributes of the music posted on social media are associated with mental health conditions of Twitter users. We created a large-scale dataset of 1519 Twitter users with six self-reported psychological disorders (depression, bipolar, anxiety, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline) and matched with 2480 control users. We then conduct an observational study to investigate the relationship between the users' psychological disorders and their musical preference by analyzing lyrics of the music tracks that the users shared on Twitter from multiple dimensions including word usage, linguistic style, sentiment and emotion patterns, topical interests and underlying semantics. Our findings reveal descriptive differences on the linguistic and semantic features of music tracks of affected users compared to control individuals and among users from different psychological disorders. Additionally, we build a feature-based and an (explainable) deep learning-based binary classifiers trained on disorder and control users and demonstrate that lyrics of the music tracks of users on Twitter can be considered as complementary information to their published posts to improve the accuracy of the disorder detection task. Overall, we find that the music attributes of users on Twitter allow inferences about their mental health status.

TI  - Characterizing Depression Issues on Sina Weibo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The prevalence of depression has increased significantly over the past few years both in developed and developing countries. However, many people with symptoms of depression still remain untreated or undiagnosed. Social media may be a tool to help researchers and clinicians to identify and support individuals who experience depression. More than 394,000,000 postings were collected from China's most popular social media website, Sina Weibo. 1000 randomly selected depression-related postings was coded and analyzed to learn the themes of these postings, and a text classifier was built to identify the postings indicating depression. The identified depressed users were compared with the general population on demographic characteristics, diurnal patterns, and patterns of emoticon usage. We found that disclosure of depression was the most popular theme; depression displayers were more engaged with social media compared to non-depression displayers, the depression postings showed geographical variations, depression displayers tended to be active during periods of leisure and sleep, and depression displayers used negative emoticons more frequently than non-depression displayers. This study offers a broad picture of depression references on China's social media, which may be cost effectively developed to detect and help individuals who may suffer from depression disorders.

TI  - Exposure to Cannabis Marketing in Social and Traditional Media and Past-Year Use Among Adolescents in States With Legal Retail Cannabis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine adolescents' self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing in states with legalized cannabis and its association with past-year cannabis use.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online panel survey of 469 adolescents aged 15-19 years residing in four states with legal retail cannabis for adult use. Adolescents self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing on social or traditional media (i.e., outdoor or print) and past-year cannabis use. Logistic regression generated estimated odds of youths' past-year cannabis use by marketing exposure after adjusting for demographic factors and cannabis-related social norms.
   Results: Exposure to cannabis marketing on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram was associated with increased odds of past-year cannabis use of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15%-234%), 88% (95% CI: 11%-219%), and 129% (95% CI: 32%-287%), respectively. Odds of past-year cannabis use increased by 48% (95% CI: 16%-87%) with each additional social media platform where adolescents reported exposure.
   Conclusions: Despite restrictions that prohibit cannabis advertising on social media, adolescents are exposed to cannabis marketing via social media, and this exposure is associated with recent cannabis use. States should consider further regulation of cannabis marketing on social media. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - Results and Methodological Implications of the Digital Epidemiology of Prescription Drug References Among Twitter Users: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Social media is an important information source for a growing subset of the population and can likely be leveraged to provide insight into the evolving drug overdose epidemic. Twitter can provide valuable insight into trends, colloquial information available to potential users, and how networks and interactivity might influence what people are exposed to and how they engage in communication around drug use. Objective: This exploratory study was designed to investigate the ways in which unsupervised machine learning analyses using natural language processing could identify coherent themes for tweets containing substance names. Methods: This study involved harnessing data from Twitter, including large-scale collection of brand name (N=262,607) and street name (N=204,068) prescription drug-related tweets and use of unsupervised machine learning analyses (ie, natural language processing) of collected data with data visualization to identify pertinent tweet themes. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with coherence score calculations was performed to compare brand (eg, OxyContin) and street (eg, oxys) name tweets. Results: We found people discussed drug use differently depending on whether a brand name or street name was used. Brand name categories often contained political talking points (eg, border, crime, and political handling of ongoing drug mitigation strategies). In contrast, categories containing street names occasionally referenced drug misuse, though multiple social uses for a term (eg, Sonata) muddled topic clarity. Conclusions: Content in the brand name corpus reflected discussion about the drug itself and less often reflected personal use. However, content in the street name corpus was notably more diverse and resisted simple LDA categorization. We speculate this may reflect effective use of slang terminology to clandestinely discuss drug-related activity. If so, straightforward analyses of digital drug-related communication may be more difficult than previously assumed. This work has the potential to be used for surveillance and detection of harmful drug use information. It also might be used for appropriate education and dissemination of information to persons engaged in drug use content on Twitter.

TI  - Analysis of a shrimp farming network during an outbreak of white spot disease in Rayong Province, Thailand
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - This study used social network analysis with the aim of establishing the importance of units (nodes) of interest and to understand the network characteristics of shrimp farming during an epidemic of white spot disease (WSD) in the Rayong province of Thailand. A case-control study at the farm-level was carried out from October 2014 to May 2015. A total of 165 questionnaires from all active farms were used for data analysis. Among the active farms used in the sample, network data from 38 case-farms and 127 control-farms were analyzed, and risk factors were determined. We found that farm visitors and post-larvae (PL) provider companies are significant factors (P < .05). Given these findings, we recommend that farmers control WSD by obtaining PL only from reliable sources and regulating farm visits to prevent the spread of WSD. These measures can help farmers effectively reduce the risk of WSD occurrence and spread.

TI  - Using Twitter to Better Understand the Spatiotemporal Patterns of Public Sentiment: A Case Study in Massachusetts, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Twitter provides a rich database of spatiotemporal information about users who broadcast their real-time opinions, sentiment, and activities. In this paper, we sought to investigate the holistic influence of land use and time period on public sentiment. A total of 880,937 tweets posted by 26,060 active users were collected across Massachusetts (MA), USA, through 31 November 2012 to 3 June 2013. The IBM Watson Alchemy API (application program interface) was employed to quantify the sentiment scores conveyed by tweets on a large scale. Then we statistically analyzed the sentiment scores across different spaces and times. A multivariate linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the fixed effects of land use and the time period on the variations in sentiment scores, considering the clustering effect of users. The results exposed clear spatiotemporal patterns of users' sentiment. Higher sentiment scores were mainly observed in the commercial and public areas, during the noon/evening and on weekends. Our findings suggest that social media outputs can be used to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of public happiness and well-being in cities and regions.

TI  - Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: A narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
AB  - Objectives: "Long COVID", a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19.
   The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.
   Methods/Results: In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.
   Conclusions: Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

TI  - Virtual Zika transmission after the first US case: who said what and how it spread on Twitter
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: This paper goes beyond detecting specific themes within Zika-related chatter on Twitter, to identify the key actors who influence the diffusive process through which some themes become more amplified than others.
   Methods: We collected all Zika-related tweets during the 3 months immediately after the first U.S. case of Zika. After the tweets were categorized into 12 themes, a cross-section were grouped into weekly datasets. to capture 12 amplifier/user groups, and analyzed by 4 amplification modes: mentions, retweets, talkers. and Twitter-wide amplifiers.
   Results: We analyzed 3.057,130 tweets in the United States and categorized 4997 users. The most talked about theme was Zika transmission (similar to 58%). News media, public health institutions, and grassroots users were the most visible and frequent sources and disseminators of Zika-related Twitter content. Grassroots users were the primary sources and disseminators of conspiracy theories.
   Conclusions: Social media analytics enable public health institutions to quickly learn what information is being disseminated, and by whom, regarding infectious diseases. Such information can help public health institutions identify and engage with news media and other active information providers. It also provides insights into media and public concerns, accuracy of information on Twitter, and information gaps. The study identifies implications for pandemic preparedness and response in the digital era and presents the agenda for future research and practice.

TI  - NIH support of mobile, imaging, pervasive sensing, social media and location tracking (MISST) research: laying the foundation to examine research ethics in the digital age
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - Mobile Imaging, pervasive Sensing, Social media and location Tracking (MISST) tools used in research are raising new ethical challenges for scientists and the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) charged with protecting human participants. Yet, little guidance exists to inform the ethical design and the IRB's regulatory review of MISST research. MISST tools/methods produce personal health data that is voluminous and granular and, which may not be subject to policies like the Health Information Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA). The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) database was used to identify the number, nature and scope of MISST-related studies supported by the NIH at three time points: 2005, 2010 and 2015. The goal was to: 1-examine the extent to which the NIH is supporting this research and, 2-identify how these tools are being used in research. The number of funded MISST research projects increased 384% from 2005 to 2015. Results revealed that while funding of MISST research is growing, it only represented about 1% of the total NIH budget in 2015. However, the number of institutes, agencies, and centers supporting MISST research increased by roughly 50%. Additionally, the scope of MISST research is diverse ranging from use of social media to track disease transmission to personalized interventions delivered through mobile health applications. Given that MISST research represents about 1% of the NIH budget and is on an increasing upward trajectory, support for research that can inform the ethical, legal and social issues associated with this research is critical.

TI  - Tweeting about measles during stages of an outbreak: A semantic network approach to the framing of an emerging infectious disease
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: The public increasingly uses social media not only to look for information about emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), but also to share opinions, emotions, and coping strategies. Identifying the frames used in social media discussion about EIDs will allow public health agencies to assess public opinions and sentiments.
   Method: This study examined how the public discussed measles during the measles outbreak in the United States during early 2015 that originated in Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA, through a semantic network analysis of the content of around 1 million tweets using KH coder.
   Results: Four frames were identified based on word frequencies and co-occurrence: news update, public health, vaccination, and political. The prominence of each individual frame changed over the corse of the pre-crisis, initial, maintenance, and resolution stages of the outbreak.
   Conclusions: This study proposed and tested a method for assessing the frames used in social media discussions about EIDs based on the creation, interpretation, and quantification of semantic networks. Public health agencies could use social media outlets, such as Twitter, to assess how the public makes sense of an EID outbreak and to create adaptive messages in communicating with the public during different stages of the crisis.

T2  - MEDINFO 2019: HEALTH AND WELLBEING E-NETWORKS FOR ALL
CP  - 17th World Congress of Medical and Health Informatics (MEDINFO)
AB  - Social media may serve as an important platform for the monitoring of population-level opioid abuse in near real-time. Our objectives for this study were to (i) manually characterize a sample of opioid-mentioning Twitter posts, (ii) compare the rates of abuse/misuse related posts between prescription and illicit opiods, and (iii) to implement and evaluate the performances of supervised machine learning algorithms for the characterization of opio id-related chatter, which can potentially automate social media based monitoring in the future.. We annotated a total of 9006 tweets into four categories, trained several machine learning algorithms and compared their performances. Deep convolutional neural networks marginally outperformed support vector machines and random forests, with an accuracy of 70.4%. Lack of context in tweets and data imbalance resulted in misclassification of many tweets to the majority class. The automatic classification experiments produced promising results, although there is room for improvement.

TI  - Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology of HIV in Sexual and Gender Minority American Adolescents and Adults: Feasibility of the Keeping it LITE Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: HIV infection rates among sexual minority men and transgender individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, remain elevated in the United States despite continued improvement in the HIV public health response. However, there remains a knowledge gap in understanding the barriers faced by this community in receiving HIV care and prevention resources. To address this, the Keeping it LITE study was conducted to assess HIV risk factors and barriers to preventive treatment in a large national cohort of young sexual minority men and transgender individuals at high risk of HIV infection.
   Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling a large remote cohort, challenges encountered in recruitment, and adjustments made to address these challenges.
   Methods: A large national cohort (n=3444) of young sexual minority men and transgender individuals were recruited. Participants were recruited via advertisements on social media; social apps for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals; print advertising; and word-of-mouth. Before enrolling, participants verified their HIV status using an at-home HIV test or by providing their own testing documentation. Descriptive statistics were generated, and a series of logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate demographic differences between recruitment methods, HIV testing methods, and enrollment status.
   Results: The Keeping it LITE study was particularly successful in recruiting participants via social media, with over half of the participants recruited from advertisements on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Participants were also recruited via word-of-mouth; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer apps (ie, Grindr, Scruff); and print advertisements, and participants recruited from these sources tended to be older and have a higher risk profile. The study was also successful in recruiting a large sample of transgender youth, particularly transgender men and nonbinary individuals. At-home HIV testing was acceptable and more heavily used by younger participants, although several barriers were encountered and overcome in the implementation of this testing. The study had more limited success in recruiting participants aged 13-17 years because of lower enrollment rates and barriers to advertising on social media platforms. The implications of these findings for the future development of HIV research and intervention protocols among sexual minorities and trans youth are discussed.
   Conclusions: The methods used in the Keeping it LITE study, particularly recruitment via social media, were found to be feasible and acceptable to participants.

TI  - Main uses of Instagram in oral health research-A scoping review
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: Infodemiology is an emerging field in public health research. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the literature on the use of Instagram as an infodemiological tool in oral health research. Methods: A scoping review approach was carried out. MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases, together with medRxiv and JMIR Publications platforms, were searched for studies representing oral health research which employed Instagram as a tool to obtain at least part of the results. Three independent reviewers performed the study screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out according to the way which Instagram was used in research. Results: We included 30 reports describing 28 studies. The approaches for using Instagram in oral health research were post's content analysis (13 reports), infoveillance (six reports), sample recruitment (five reports) and as a platform to deliver an exposure or intervention (six reports). Four reports were published in 2019, 13 in 2020 and 13 in 2021. Topics related to patient experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and ethical compliance were highlighted. Conclusions: We described new opportunities in this growing field by the identification of four main uses of Instagram in oral health research and encourage dental professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge translation in this social media. Future studies using Instagram as a data source must improve search and evaluation quality. Public Interest Summary: Infodemiology (information epidemiology) is a growing field in public health research and the interest in Instagram social media has increased during the pandemic scenario. On the light of these aspects, a literature overview may be important to describe new opportunities for researchers. Using a scoping review approach, we found that Instagram can be used in oral health research as a source to content analysis and information surveillance, as well as a platform to sample recruitment and to deliver an exposure or intervention. Topics related to patient experiences, misinformation, professional education, plaque control and ethical compliance were highlighted in the included studies. Our results may help to delineate further research using Instagram and encourage dental professionals to support accurate and ethical knowledge translation in this social media. Finally, future studies using Instagram as a data source must improve search and evaluation quality.

TI  - Tradition Gone Mobile: An Exploration of #Betelnut on Instagram
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
AB  - Background:As a psychoactive substance that spans borders and cultures, researchers estimate that 600 million people use the areca nut. Despite its historical and geographical significance, betel nut use has received far less research attention than other stimulants such as tobacco, coffee or tea. Scholars have observed that social media platforms have significant effects on the promotion and use of addictive substances.Objectives:Our study investigates user practices and activities on a sample of Instagram posts tagged #betelnut dating back to 2011.Methods:Using social media analytics and hashtag network analysis, we examined user practices and activities on a sample of over 7800 Instagram posts tagged #betelnut dated between July 2011 to February 2019 that were collected in early 2019.Results:Findings determined that #betelnut is a growing topical hashtag on Instagram with content that drives social engagement.Importance:Co-occurring hashtags with #betelnut reflect regional language and cultural naming conventions that center around the Indian subcontinent and Melanesia. The importance of future work in this area is highlighted.

TI  - Lack of consistency in measurement methods and semantics used for network measures in adolescent health behaviour studies using social network analysis: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background Social network analysis (SNA) is often used to examine how social relationships influence adolescent health behaviours, but no study has documented the range of network measures used to do so. We aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA. Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms. Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201, 100%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6%) and popularity (n=110, 54.7%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for 'similarity on popularity' (within the 'similarity' category) to 28 for the 'characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and nominated peers' (within the 'nature of the relationships' category). Using the examples of 'social isolation', 'group membership', 'individuals in a central position' (within the 'position within the network' category) and 'nominations of influential peers' (sub within the 'popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public health intervention based on SNA.

TI  - Calisthenics: Epidemiology of Injury Patterns and Their Risk Factors
T2  - OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To quantify the prevalence and nature of injuries and their risk factors in calisthenics to, therefore, inform the practitioner what to expect from these athletes. Methods: This study was an online cross-sectional survey of calisthenics athletes. Data were collected online and the survey was distributed via social media over six months in 2020. The purpose-built survey consisted of demographic, training and loading questions. Participants were provided with an injury definition and reported their total number of injuries sustained during calisthenics including detailed information on three most significant injuries, along with mechanism of injury and risk factors. Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine objective factors associated with the number of injuries. Results: There were 543 participants describing 1104 injuries. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) injury prevalence was 4.5 (3.3) per person. Of these injuries, 820 (74.3%) required training modification or treatment. Participants missed a mean (SD) 3.4 (5.1) weeks of training and engaged in a mean (SD) 10.9 (9.1) health professional consultations. The most common injuries were upper leg (24.5%), ankle/foot (22.8%) and lumbar spine (19.3%), with the majority being sprains/strains in nature (56.3%). Mechanism of injury included elevated work (27.6%), overuse (38.0%) and specific calisthenics skills (38.9%) - such as lumbar (40.6%) and lower limb (40.3%) extension-based movements. Subjective risk factors included load (66.8%), preparation (55.9%) and environmental factors (21.0%). Objective risk factors associated with higher numbers of injuries included increased years of participation, left leg dominance, increased training hours (regardless of training type) and state team participation (p<0.05). Conclusion: Practitioners need to be aware that calisthenics athletes demonstrate a high proportion of strain/sprain injuries involving the lower limb and lumbar spine with causative movements being extension-based. Addressing risk factors such as loading, preparation, asymmetry, and the environment related to these movements are important for the treating practitioner.

TI  - An analysis of Google Trends following athletic injuries by high profile NBA players during the 2019 NBA finals
T2  - JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE
AB  - Context: Injuries are common among high profile players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and could provide an opportunity for physicians to provide accurate sports injury information and reliable rehabilitation data to the general public in the immediate aftermath.
   Objectives: To evaluate social media trends to investigate public interest in athletic injuries in the NBA and to evaluate the length of maintained interest in these injuries.
   Methods: The Google Trends tool was used to analyze search data around two high profile players-Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson-who suffered injuries during the 2019 NBA Finals. The results were compared to the expected search forecast derived from an autoregressive integrated moving algorithm model.
   Results: Both players were associated with a mean increase of 1,052.4% (standard deviation [SD], 703.96%) in relative search volumes for terms related to their injuries. This data showed a significant increase in search engine activity related to injuries associated with NBA players in the first 6.13 days (SD, 3.14 days) following the injuries, marking a substantial timeframe for public engagement.
   Conclusions: Search traffic information may be beneficial to the sports medicine community, as social media can provide a platform for patient education in a limited timeframe. By increasing patient awareness and knowledge regarding athletic injuries, social media can expand the pool of potential patients for physicians and surgeons.

TI  - #Crohn's: Historical Cohort of Twitter Activity
T2  - CROHNS & COLITIS 360
AB  - Background: Analysis of the Twitter activity on #Crohn's, identifying individuals with interest in Crohn's disease on Twitter.
   Methods: A historic cohort study was conducted about Twitter activity evaluation of #Crohn's analyzed over a period of 9 years. For the Twitter analysis, a health-care social media analytics tool, Symplur Signals, was adopted.
   Results: From 2011 until 2019, 627,000 tweets of #Crohn's were detected, with 276,380 retweets by 109,937 users; of these users, 32.4% were patient advocates and 12.6% were doctors. There was a pattern of annual peak activity of the #Crohn's, mainly in May and December, and less activity, usually in July. Of all tweets, 52.5% were categorized as positive and 47.5% as negative.
   Conclusions: Social media, especially Twitter, represents an important information tool, but it is still underutilized by gastroenterologists. This study suggests a significant interference of international awareness campaigns about inflammatory bowel disease in the activity of #Crohn's on Twitter, denoting an increase in debating this topic on the platform. Discussions on the subject by health professionals are still below expectations regarding the importance of the theme.

TI  - Preventing Internal COVID-19 Outbreaks within Businesses and Institutions: A Methodology Based on Social Networks Analysis for Supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services Decision Making
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study aims at developing and demonstrating in a real case study a methodology for supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and assessment of preventive measures to reduce the risks of COVID-19 outbreaks within their entities. The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is still a challenge.

TI  - Entry and initial spread of COVID-19 in India: Epidemiological analysis of media surveillance data, India, 2020
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: India reported first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 30 January from Kerala. Media surveillance is useful to capture unstructured information about outbreaks. We established media surveillance and described the characteristics of the COVID-19 cases, clusters, deaths by time, place, and person during January-March 2020 in India.
   Methods: The media surveillance team of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology abstracted data from public domains of India's Central and State health ministries, online news and social media platforms for the period of January 31 to March 26, 2020. We collected data on person (socio-demographics, circumstances of travel/contact, clinical and laboratory), time (date/period of reported exposures; laboratory confirmation and death) and place (location). We drew epidemic curve, described frequencies of cases by age and gender. We described available details for identified clusters.
   Results: As of March 26, 2020, India reported 694 (Foreigners = 45, 6%) confirmed COVID-19 cases (Attack rate = 0.5 per million population) and 17 deaths (Fatality = 2.5%) from 21 States and 6 Union Territories. The cases were higher among 20-59 years of age (60 of 85) and male gender (65 of 107). Median age at death was 68 years (Range: 38-85 years). We identified 13 clusters with a total of 63 cases and four deaths among the first 200 cases.
   Conclusion: Surveillance of media sources was useful in characterizing the epidemic in the early phase. Hence, media surveillance should be integrated in the routine surveillance systems to map the events specially in context of new disease outbreaks.

TI  - "I Haven't Been Diagnosed, but I Should Be"-Insight Into Self-diagnoses of Common Mental Health Disorders: Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In recent years, social media has become a rich source of mental health data. However, there is a lack of web-based research on the accuracy and validity of self-reported diagnostic information available on the web.Objective: An analysis of the degree of correspondence between self-reported diagnoses and clinical indicators will afford researchers and clinicians higher levels of trust in social media analyses. We hypothesized that self-reported diagnoses would correspond to validated disorder-specific severity questionnaires across 2 large web-based samples.Methods: The participants of study 1 were 1123 adults from a national Qualtrics panel (mean age 34.65, SD 12.56 years; n=635, 56.65% female participants,). The participants of study 2 were 2237 college students from a large university in the Midwest (mean age 19.08, SD 2.75 years; n=1761, 75.35% female participants). All participants completed a web-based survey on their mental health, social media use, and demographic information. Additionally, the participants reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with a series of disorders, with the option of selecting "Yes"; "No, but I should be"; "I don't know"; or "No" for each condition. We conducted a series of ANOVA tests to determine whether there were differences among the 4 diagnostic groups and used post hoc Tukey tests to examine the nature of the differences.Results: In study 1, for self-reported mania (F3,1097=2.75; P=.04), somatic symptom disorder (F3,1060=26.75; P<.001), and alcohol use disorder (F3,1097=77.73; P<.001), the pattern of mean differences did not suggest that the individuals were accurate in their self-diagnoses. In study 2, for all disorders but bipolar disorder (F3,659=1.43; P=.23), ANOVA results were consistent with our expectations. Across both studies and for most conditions assessed, the individuals who said that they had been diagnosed with a disorder had the highest severity scores on self-report questionnaires, but this was closely followed by individuals who had not been diagnosed but believed that they should be diagnosed. This was especially true for depression, generalized anxiety, and insomnia. For mania and bipolar disorder, the questionnaire scores did not differentiate individuals who had been diagnosed from those who had not.Conclusions: In general, if an individual believes that they should be diagnosed with an internalizing disorder, they are experiencing a degree of psychopathology similar to those who have already been diagnosed. Self-reported diagnoses correspond well with symptom severity on a continuum and can be trusted as clinical indicators, especially in common internalizing disorders such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Researchers can put more faith into patient self-reports, including those in web-based experiments such as social media posts, when individuals report diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders. However, replication and further study are recommended.

TI  - Online Health Monitoring using Facebook Advertisement Audience Estimates in the United States: Evaluation Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Facebook, the most popular social network with over one billion daily users, provides rich opportunities for its use in the health domain. Though much of Facebook's data are not available to outsiders, the company provides a tool for estimating the audience of Facebook advertisements, which includes aggregated information on the demographics and interests, such as weight loss or dieting, of Facebook users. This paper explores the potential uses of Facebook ad audience estimates for eHealth by studying the following: (1) for what type of health conditions prevalence estimates can be obtained via social media and (2) what type of marker interests are useful in obtaining such estimates, which can then be used for recruitment within online health interventions.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to understand the limitations and capabilities of using Facebook ad audience estimates for public health monitoring and as a recruitment tool for eHealth interventions.
   Methods: We use the Facebook Marketing application programming interface to correlate estimated sizes of audiences having health-related interests with public health data. Using several study cases, we identify both potential benefits and challenges in using this tool.
   Results: We find several limitations in using Facebook ad audience estimates, for example, using placebo interest estimates to control for background level of user activity on the platform. Some Facebook interests such as plus-size clothing show encouraging levels of correlation (r=.74) across the 50 US states; however, we also sometimes find substantial correlations with the placebo interests such as r=.68 between interest in Technology and Obesity prevalence. Furthermore, we find demographic-specific peculiarities in the interests on health-related topics.
   Conclusions: Facebook's advertising platform provides aggregate data for more than 190 million US adults. We show how disease-specific marker interests can be used to model prevalence rates in a simple and intuitive manner. However, we also illustrate that building effective marker interests involves some trial-and-error, as many details about Facebook's black box remain opaque.

TI  - Social epidemiology of early adolescent problematic screen use in the United States
T2  - PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Objective To determine sociodemographic correlates of problematic screen use (social media, video games, mobile phones) among a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population-based sample of 10-14-year-old early adolescents. Study design We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (Year 2, 2018-2020; N = 8753). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary language, household income, parental education) and adolescent-reported problematic video game (Video Game Addiction Questionnaire), social media (Social Media Addiction Questionnaire), and mobile phone use (Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire). Results Boys reported higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Having unmarried/unpartnered parents was associated with higher problematic social media use. Although higher household income was generally protective against problematic video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents (p for interaction <0.05). Conclusions Given the sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use, digital literacy education strategies can focus on at-risk populations, encourage targeted counseling by pediatricians, and adapt family media use plans for diverse backgrounds. Impact While sociodemographic differences in screen time are documented, we examined sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use in a large, diverse sample of early adolescents in the US. Boys reported higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Although higher household income was generally protective against problematic video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents. Beyond time spent on screens, pediatricians, parents, and educators should be aware of sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use.

TI  - Towards scaling Twitter for digital epidemiology of birth defects
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - Social media has recently been used to identify and study a small cohort of Twitter users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes-the leading cause of infant mortality-could be observed via their publicly available tweets. In this study, we exploit social media on a larger scale by developing natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically detect, among thousands of users, a cohort of mothers reporting that their child has a birth defect. We used 22,999 annotated tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms-feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers-that automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user's pregnancy outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90% of the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two positive classes: an F-1-score of 0.65 for the "defect" class and 0.51 for the "possible defect" class. We deployed the classifier on 20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort. Contributions of this study include (1) NLP methods for automatically detecting tweets by users reporting their birth defect outcomes, (2) findings that an SVM classifier can outperform a deep neural network-based classifier for highly imbalanced social media data, (3) evidence that automatic classification can be used to identify additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort, and (4) a publicly available corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms.

TI  - A longitudinal and geospatial analysis of COVID-19 tweets during the early outbreak period in the United States
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionEarly reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths may not accurately convey community-level concern about the pandemic during early stages, particularly in the United States where testing capacity was initially limited. Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic.MethodsTweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities.ResultsFrom an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased.ConclusionResults from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.

TI  - Contraceptive care in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: A social media survey of contraceptive access, telehealth use and telehealth quality
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Objectives: To examine demographic, socioeconomic, and regional differences in contraceptive access, differences between telehealth and in-person contraception visits, and telehealth quality in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.Study design: We surveyed reproductive-age women about contraception visits during the COVID-19 pandemic via social media in July 2020 and January 2021. We used multivariable regression to examine relationships between age, racial/ethnic identity, educational attainment, income, insurance type, region, and COVID-19 related hardship, and ability to obtain a contraceptive appointment, telehealth vs in-person visits, and telehealth quality scores.Results: Among 2031 respondents seeking a contraception visit, 1490 (73.4%) reported any visit, of which 530 (35.6%) were telehealth. In adjusted analyses, lower odds of any visit was associated with Hispanic/ Latinx and Mixed race/Other identity (aOR 0.59 [0.37-0.94], aOR 0.36 [0.22-0.59], respectively), the South, Midwest, Northeast (aOR 0.63 [0.47-0.85], aOR 0.64 [0.46-0.90], aOR 0.52 [CI 0.36-0.75], respectively), no insurance (aOR 0.63 [0.43-0.91]), greater COVID-19 hardship (aOR 0.52 [0.31-0.87]), and earlier pandemic timing (January 2021 vs July 2020 aOR 2.14 [1.69-2.70]). Respondents from the Midwest and South had lower odds of telehealth vs in-person care (aOR 0.63 [0.44-0.88], aOR 0.54 [0.40-0.72], respectively). Hispanic/Latinx respondents and those in the Midwest had lower odds of high telehealth quality (aOR 0.37 [0.17-0.80], aOR 0.58 [0.35-0.95], respectively).Conclusions: We found inequities in contraceptive care access, less telehealth use for contraception visits in the South and Midwest, and lower telehealth quality among Hispanic/Latinx people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should focus on telehealth access, quality, and patients' preferences. Implications: Historically marginalized groups have faced disproportionate barriers to contraceptive care, and telehealth for contraceptive care has not been employed equitably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though telehealth has the potential to improve access to care, inequitable implementation could exacerbate existing disparities.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Jointly Predicting Affective and Mental Health Scores Using Deep Neural Networks of Visual Cues on the Web
T2  - WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, WISE 2018, PT II
CP  - 19th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE)
AB  - Despite the range of studies examining the relationship between mental health and social media data, not all prior studies have validated the social media markers against "ground truth", or validated psychiatric information, in general community samples. Instead, researchers have approximated psychiatric diagnosis using user statements such as "I have been diagnosed as X". Without "ground truth", the value of predictive algorithms is highly questionable and potentially harmful. In addition, for social media data, whilst linguistic features have been widely identified as strong markers of mental health disorders, little is known about non-textual features on their links with the disorders. The current work is a longitudinal study during which participants' mental health data, consisting of depression and anxiety scores, were collected fortnightly with a validated, diagnostic, clinical measure. Also, datasets with labels relevant to mental health scores, such as emotional scores, are also employed to improve the performance in prediction of mental health scores. This work introduces a deep neural network-based method integrating sub-networks on predicting affective scores and mental health outcomes from images. Experimental results have shown that in the both predictions of emotion and mental health scores, (1) deep features majorly outperform handcrafted ones and (2) the proposed network achieves better performance compared with separate networks.

TI  - A/C study protocol: a cross-sectional study of HIV epidemiology among African, Caribbean and Black people in Ontario
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities are disproportionately infected by HIV in Ontario, Canada. They constitute only 5% of the population of Ontario yet account for 25% of new diagnoses of HIV. The aim of this study is to understand underlying factors that augment the HIV risk in ACB communities and to inform policy and practice in Ontario. Methods and analysis We will conduct a cross-sectional study of first-generation and second-generation ACB adults aged 15-64 in Toronto (n=1000) and Ottawa (n=500) and collect data on sociodemographic information, sexual behaviours, substance use, blood donation, access and use of health services and HIV-related care. We will use dried blood spot testing to determine the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection among ACB people, and link participant data to administrative databases to investigate health service access and use. Factors associated with key outcomes (HIV infection, testing behaviours, knowledge about HIV transmission and acquisition, HIV vulnerability, access and use of health services) will be evaluated using generalised linear mixed models, adjusted for relevant covariates. Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and approved by the following Research Ethics Boards: Toronto Public Health, Ottawa Public Health, Laurentian University; the University of Ottawa and the University of Toronto. Our findings will be disseminated as community reports, fact sheets, digital stories, oral and poster presentations, peer-reviewed manuscripts and social media.

TI  - Twitter message types, health beliefs, and vaccine attitudes during the 2015 measles outbreak in California
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: Social media not only provide platforms for the public to obtain information about a disease but also allow them to share their opinions and experiences about it.
   Methods: This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles outbreak.
   Results: News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4%), followed by personal opinions (33.7%), resources (19.4%), personal experiences (2.5%), and questions (1.6%). Susceptibility was the most discussed health belief (21.8%), followed by cues to action (18.9%) and severity (13.0%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more likely to link to emerging news websites.
   Conclusions: Understanding who posts what on social media during an infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide timely and effective information.

TI  - Network analysis of pig movements in Ecuador: Strengthening surveillance of classical swine fever
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - The analysis of domestic pig movements has become useful to understand the disease spread patterns and epidemiology, which facilitates the development of more effective animal diseases control strategies. The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55%). Backyard producers made up 89% of the network premises, and the top 2% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to improve its procedures and update the disease control and management policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based surveillance.

TI  - A Review of Global Epidemiology and Response to Meningococcal Disease Outbreaks among Men Who Have Sex with Men, 2001-2018
T2  - CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewMen who have sex with men (MSM) have been previously shown to be at increased risk for meningococcal disease compared to other men. We summarized the global epidemiology and public health response to meningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM.Recent FindingsAt least ten outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease among MSM have been reported since 2001. Investigation of and response to outbreaks among MSM have often been hampered by an inability to identify epidemiologic links among cases, and the target population recommended for vaccination has been expanded over time in many outbreaks. Unique communication methods, including the use of apps and social media, have been used during some outbreaks to identify close contacts and to communicate health messages. Although HIV-infected MSM have a higher risk of sporadic meningococcal disease in the USA, other factors are likely contributing to outbreaks among MSM. An increase in urethritis due to Neisseria meningitidis has recently been reported in US men, though its role in meningococcal disease transmission among MSM remains unclear.SummaryMeningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM raise questions regarding possible unique risk factors in this population. The role of HIV infection and mode of N. meningitidis transmission are being investigated to provide further insights into meningococcal disease and outbreaks in this population. Vaccination remains the primary prevention and control strategy during meningococcal disease outbreaks among MSM.

TI  - Multidimensional Risk Communication: Public Discourse on Risks during an Emerging Epidemic
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI 2018)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - Crisis informatics has examined how institutions and individuals seek, communicate, and curate information in response to crises. The public's communication and perception of risks on social media remain understudied. In this study, we report a qualitative analysis of public perceptions of risks and risk management measures on Reddit during the Zika crisis, an emerging epidemic associated with high uncertainty regarding pathology, epidemiology, and broad consequences. We found two types of perceived risks: ones directly caused by the Zika virus, and ones potentially introduced by authorities' risk management measures. Risk perceptions unfolded along multiple dimensions beyond the imminent and personal level. Reddit users discussed in a speculative way to foresee various risks in the long nun or at larger geographical scales. We discuss the multidimensionality and speculative nature of risk perception on social media, and derive implications for crisis informatics research and public health research and practice.

TI  - HIV Response Interventions that Integrate HIV Molecular Cluster and Social Network Analysis: A Systematic Review
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Due to improved efficiency and reduced cost of viral sequencing, molecular cluster analysis can be feasibly utilized alongside existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention strategies. The goal of this paper is to elucidate how HIV molecular cluster and social network analyses are being integrated to implement HIV response interventions. We searched PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases for studies incorporating both HIV molecular cluster and social network data. We identified 32 articles that combined analyses of HIV molecular sequences and social or sexual networks. All studies were descriptive. Six studies described network interventions informed by molecular and social data but did not fully evaluate their efficacy. There is no current standard for incorporating molecular and social network analyses to inform interventions or data demonstrating its utility. More research must be conducted to delineate benefits and best practices for leveraging molecular data for network-based interventions.

TI  - Intradepartment scientific collaboration in Journal of Research in Medical Sciences: A co-authorship study
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: This study aimed to use social network analysis (SNA) indicators and clique analysis to investigate collaboration between different departments and research centers in Journal of Research in Medical Sciences (JRMS) in 2012-2016. Materials and Methods: The study was a scientometric study using micro-and macro-indicators of SNA to investigate the performance of departments and research centers in JRMS. The population consisted of 1073 articles published in JRMS in 2012-2016. Ravar Matrix, UCINET, and VOSviewer software were used for data analysis. Results: According to the productivity and triple centrality indicators, "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics," "Department of Pathology," and Department of "Internal Medicine" allocated the first three ranks. Analyzing the cliques of co-authorship network for departments and research centers showed that this network consists of 19 cliques with at least 7 members in each clique. Furthermore, only 30 nodes (8.90% of all nodes in the network) had the presence in minimum clique size of at least 7. Conclusion: Given the importance and position of scientific collaboration in medical research and its effect on other performance indicators such as efficiency, effectiveness, and number of citations, it is necessary for policy-makers to propose new strategies for improving scientific collaboration.

TI  - Micro Quality of Life: Assessing Health and Well-Being in and around Public Facilities in New York City
T2  - APPLIED RESEARCH IN QUALITY OF LIFE
AB  - Microblogs and other social media platforms are increasingly used as sources of data for analyzing social issues and problems, and for determining appropriate public policy. Our research investigates the utility of an urban social listening approach in considering quality of life around public facilities in New York City, and the possibility of combining conventional public health data and microblogging data from Twitter to render an instructive sketch of urban neighborhoods. We demonstrate that this approach shows promise, with significant relationships between tweet scores, unemployment rates, and incidences of diabetes in the localized geographies we analyzed. While limitations exist, we provide a roadmap for future research as scholars seek to understand the health and well-being of urban populations.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> To Describe the Transmission Dynamics Among Inuit Residing in Iqaluit Nunavut Using Whole-Genome Sequencing
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among Inuit in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing.
   Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis.
   Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95% confidence interval, .97-1.0).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.

TI  - Electronic cigarettes: Emerging trends and research hotspots
T2  - TOBACCO INDUCED DISEASES
AB  - INTRODUCTION Research on electronic cigarettes is an emerging field, with the number of articles in this field noted to have grown exponentially over recent years. We used a bibliometric analysis method (co-word analysis) to analyze the emerging trends and research hotspots in this field.
   METHODS Publication data on electronic cigarettes from 2010 to 2018 were retrieved and downloaded from the PubMed database. Theme trends and knowledge structures were analyzed on the relevant research fields of electronic cigarettes by using a biclustering analysis, strategic diagram analysis, and social network analysis methods. Research hotspots were extracted and compared from three periods.
   RESULTS Core topics that have continuously develop between the years 2010 and 2018 include: tobacco use cessation devices; tobacco products; tobacco use cessation devices/adverse effects; smoking prevention and adverse effects; electronic nicotine delivery systems/economics; and public health. Some currently undeveloped topics that could be considered as new future research directions include: tobacco use disorder/therapy; tobacco use disorder/epidemiology; students/psychology; students/statistics and numerical data; adolescent behavior/psychology; nicotine/toxicity; nicotinic agonists/administration and dosage; and electronic nicotine delivery systems/legislation and jurisprudence.
   CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that some currently immature topics in strategic coordinates and emerging hotspots in social network graphs can be used as future research directions.

TI  - Harnessing Tweets for Early Detection of an Acute Disease Event
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Melbourne, Australia, witnessed a thunderstorm asthma outbreak on 21 November 2016, resulting in over 8,000 hospital admissions by 6 p.m. This is a typical acute disease event. Because the time to respond is short for acute disease events, an algorithm based on time between events has shown promise. Shorter the time between consecutive incidents of the disease, more likely the outbreak. Social media posts such as tweets can be used as input to the monitoring algorithm. However, due to the large volume of tweets, a large number of alerts may be produced. We refer to this problem as alert swamping. Methods: We present a four-step architecture for the early detection of the acute disease event, using social media posts (tweets) on Twitter. To curb alert swamping, the first three steps of the algorithm ensure the relevance of the tweets. The fourth step is a monitoring algorithm based on time between events. We experiment with a dataset of tweets posted in Melbourne from 2014 to 2016, focusing on the thunderstorm asthma outbreak in Melbourne in November 2016. Results: Out of our 18 experiment combinations, three detected the thunderstorm asthma outbreak up to 9 hours before the time mentioned in the official report, and five were able to detect it before the first news report. Conclusions: With appropriate checks against alert swamping in place and the use of a monitoring algorithm based on time between events, tweets can provide early alerts for an acute disease event such as thunderstorm asthma.

TI  - Identifying Key Topics Bearing Negative Sentiment on Twitter: Insights Concerning the 2015-2016 Zika Epidemic
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: To understand the public sentiment regarding the Zika virus, social media can be leveraged to understand how positive, negative, and neutral sentiments are expressed in society. Specifically, understanding the characteristics of negative sentiment could help inform federal disease control agencies' efforts to disseminate relevant information to the public about Zika-related issues.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the public sentiment concerning Zika using posts on Twitter and determine the qualitative characteristics of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed.
   Methods: Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used to analyze the sentiment of tweets concerning Zika. A supervised machine learning classifier was built to classify tweets into 3 sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Tweets in each category were then examined using a topic-modeling approach to determine the main topics for each category, with focus on the negative category.
   Results: A total of 5303 tweets were manually annotated and used to train multiple classifiers. These performed moderately well (F1 score=0.48-0.68) with text-based feature extraction. All 48,734 tweets were then categorized into the sentiment categories. Overall, 10 topics for each sentiment category were identified using topic modeling, with a focus on the negative sentiment category.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how sentiment expressed within discussions of epidemics on Twitter can be discovered. This allows public health officials to understand public sentiment regarding an epidemic and enables them to address specific elements of negative sentiment in real time. Our negative sentiment classifier was able to identify tweets concerning Zika with 3 broad themes: neural defects,Zika abnormalities, and reports and findings. These broad themes were based on domain expertise and from topics discussed in journals such as Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and Vaccine. As the majority of topics in the negative sentiment category concerned symptoms, officials should focus on spreading information about prevention and treatment research.

TI  - Trend of influenza vaccine Facebook posts in last 4 years: a content analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: Decreasing immunization rates may be partly due to antivaccine campaigns and other sources of misinformation available on social media, particularly on Facebook. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating vaccine-related information, it is important to analyze the trend of information available on Facebook.
   Methods: We searched Facebook on August 15, 2018 to obtain posts containing relevant health information on influenza vaccine in years 2015-2018. We collected information regarding nature of the post (eg, pro-, antivaccine, and informational), number of shares and likes received, and ease of reading for each post. We evaluated these characteristics by year and type of post in our exploratory analyses.
   Results: The proportion of pro-vaccine posts has increased compared to antivaccine and informational posts since 2016. There was no correlation between ease of reading and popularity of posts. Although the language of antivaccine posts was complex, they were shared and liked more than pro-vaccine posts. The pro-vaccine personal post by a nurse was the most popular in our study (shared over 46,000 times) in 2018.
   Conclusions: Though the number of pro-vaccine posts increased, antivaccine posts remained more popular. The government agency may use an emotive personal family-oriented message to promote vaccination. (C) 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

TI  - Modelling control strategies against classical swine fever: Influence of traders and markets using static and temporal networks in Ecuador
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and cultural sector, challenged by classical swine fever (CSF). Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 %; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 %, while with random movement restriction it was 13 %. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 % overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.

TI  - Facebook ads to the rescue? Recruiting a hard to reach population into an Internet-based behavioral health intervention trial
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective: Facebook (FB) ads are touted as a way to facilitate recruitment of hard to reach participants into digital health research but the evidence has been mixed. This study aimed to empirically evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of paid ads for recruitment into a national trial testing an Internet-based, coached intervention for parents of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.
   Methods: Post hoc analysis of FB ad data and Google analytics on the online trial consent site (myStudies) were conducted on 11 campaigns employing static image/text ads. Standard metrics (e.g., click through rate, cost per 1000 impressions, cost per consent) were calculated and descriptive statistics comparing FB ad engagement and enrolled participants over time were conducted.
   Results: Ad campaigns were active for a combined 115 days over 58 weeks resulting in 1533 links to the online recruitment site. During the ad campaigns, the mean rate of enrolment was 1 participant every 2 days. The first 3 ad campaigns were the most cost-effective. Mean cost per enrolment was $19.27 (Canadian dollars).
   Conclusions: FB ads were efficient and cost-effective in broad dissemination of trial information, but more research is needed to explore the impact of saturation (how often ads are posted), design (what is in the ad), and individual determinants (who is likely to respond to an ad) on converting FB ad engagement into enrolment. Avoiding a reductionist approach to analytics will help ensure appropriate and targeted strategies remain the priority for digital health research recruitment through social media.

TI  - The information and support needs of patients living with inflammatory bowel disease: A qualitative study
T2  - CHRONIC ILLNESS
AB  - Objectives
   To explore patients' experiences of living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with a focus on their information and support needs.
   Methods
   Qualitative interview study involving adults diagnosed with IBD recruited through social media. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and data were analysed thematically.
   Results
   Interviews with 15 patients (9 females, 6 males) highlighted how misdiagnosis or hesitation to diagnose had caused frustration and anxiety. Once diagnosed, only a few participants received detailed information about IBD from their doctor. Negative experiences shared on social media caused initial anxiety, as individuals assumed that they may have a similar experience, yet online communities enabled insights into the experiences of others, helping patients adjust to living with IBD. Participants described both positive and negative impacts of living with IBD, including improved confidence and periods of anxiety.
   Discussion: Our findings highlight the importance of clear information and support from health professionals, as well as the benefits of online communities for ongoing support. At the point of diagnosis, patients would benefit from information about what IBD is, as well as how it may impact day to day life from doctors so that social media is not the only source of initial information about IBD.

TI  - Information exchange networks for chronic diseases in primary care practices in Germany: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PRIMARY CARE
AB  - Background: Coordination of care requires information exchange between health workers. The structure of their information exchange networks may influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021. As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of connections, density and centralization for each of the health conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in primary care practices.
   Results: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17 for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members. Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with nurses and pharmacists.
   Conclusions: This study identified four types of information exchange structures, which provides a practical tool for management and improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer connections and could hardly be considered a network.

TI  - Health information seeking behavior of the population in Majmaah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: The Internet nowadays is the most popular and time-saving tool for gaining a lot of information. This is true for health knowledge also, because almost everyone is keen to know about their health disorders, treatment, healthcare centers and also how to stay healthy. There was a felt need to study the prevalence among the population of the access to Internet for health-related information. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to investigate the different health information seeking behaviors among the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional, observational and population-based study in Majmaah city. Based on the (prevalence rate = 50%) previous articles, the sample size was calculated equal to 384. Data was collected by pre-tested, close ended, interviewee-based questionnaire to know people behavior in seeking health information. Results: The majority are using the internet as a source of health information (71.3%, n=321) followed by friends who are health workers (31.3%, n=140). Internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, etc.) being the most commonly used to gain health information through Internet (68.2%, n=307) followed by Social media (9.8%, n=44). Conclusion: This study revealed that internet use for seeking health information is in increasing manner with intemet search engines (Google, Yahoo...etc) being the most used source. We conclude that internet use for seeking health information is still a common behavior in the population.

TI  - Design and methodological characteristics of studies using observational routinely collected health data for investigating the link between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases: protocol for a meta-research study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Health services generate large amounts of routine health data (eg, administrative databases, disease registries and electronic health records), which have important secondary uses for research. Increases in the availability and the ability to access and analyse large amounts of data represent a major opportunity for conducting studies on the possible relationships between complex diseases. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the design, methods and reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected health data for investigating the link between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Methods and analysis This is the protocol for a meta-research study. We registered the study protocol within the Open Science Framework: https://ostio/h2qjg. We will evaluate observational studies (eg, cohort and case-control) conducted using routinely collected health data for investigating the associations between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease). The following electronic databases will be searched (from their inception onwards): MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. Screening and selection of articles will be conducted by at least two researchers. Potential discrepancies will be resolved via discussion. Design, methods and reporting characteristics in each article will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form. Information on general, methodological and transparency items will be reported. We will summarise our findings with tables and graphs (eg, bar charts, forest plots).
   Ethics and dissemination Due to the nature of the proposed study, no ethical approval will be required. We plan to publish the full study in an open access peer-reviewed journal and disseminate the findings at scientific conferences and via social media. All data will be deposited in a cross-disciplinary public repository.

TI  - Estimating County-Level Overdose Rates Using Opioid-Related Twitter Data: Interdisciplinary Infodemiology Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: There were an estimated 100,306 drug overdose deaths between April 2020 and April 2021, a three-quarter increase from the prior 12-month period. There is an approximate 6-month reporting lag for provisional counts of drug overdose deaths from the National Vital Statistics System, and the highest level of geospatial resolution is at the state level. By contrast, public social media data are available close to real-time and are often accessible with precise coordinates.Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess whether county-level overdose mortality burden could be estimated using opioid-related Twitter data.Methods: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for poisoning or exposure to overdose at the county level were obtained from CDC WONDER. Demographics were collected from the American Community Survey. The Twitter Application Programming Interface was used to obtain tweets that contained any of the 36 terms with drug names. An unsupervised classification approach was used for clustering tweets. Population-normalized variables and polynomial population-normalized variables were produced. Furthermore, z scores of the Getis Ord Gi clustering statistic were produced, and both these scores and their polynomial counterparts were explored in regression modeling of county-level overdose mortality burden. A series of linear regression models were used for predictive modeling to explore the interpretability of the analytical output.Results: Modeling overdose mortality with normalized demographic variables alone explained only 7.4% of the variability in county-level overdose mortality, whereas this was approximately doubled by the use of specific demographic and Twitter data covariates based on a backward selection approach. The highest adjusted R2 and lowest AIC (Akaike Info Criterion) were obtained for the model with normalized demographic variables, normalized z scores from geospatial analyses, and normalized topic counts (adjusted R2=0.133, AIC=8546.8). The z scores of the Getis Ord Gi statistic appeared to have improved utility over population-normalization alone. In this model, median age, female population, and tweets about web-based drug sales were positively associated with opioid mortality. Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity were significantly negatively associated with county-level burdens of overdose mortality.Conclusions: Social media data, when transformed using certain statistical approaches, may add utility to the goal of producing closer to real-time county-level estimates of overdose mortality. Prediction of opioid-related outcomes can be advanced to inform prevention and treatment decisions. This interdisciplinary approach can facilitate evidence-based funding decisions for various substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs.

TI  - Adolescent Anxiety and TikTok: An Exploratory Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Social media is ubiquitous in adolescents' lives. TikTok is a medium primarily used by adolescents and young adults under 30 years. TikTok is thus an appropriate social media platform with which to examine discussions of anxiety among this age cohort. In this exploratory mixed-methods study we aimed to evaluate the scope of anxiety content available on TikTok in English in December 2021, and to further develop methods for analysing TikTok content. Methods We analysed a data set of 147 TikToks with the hashtag #anxiety. The data set consisted both of metadata and TikTok videos. This data set represented 18% of all TikToks featuring the hashtag #anxiety in December 2021. We examined the following research questions (RQs). RQ1: What are the creator identities reflected in the final data set in this study?; RQ2: What are the metadata characteristics of the TikToks in the final data set?; RQ3: What are the anxiety content themes in the final data set?; and RQ4: What are the characteristics of the data set based on an anxiety management reference checklist? This study involves public data that can reasonably be observed by strangers. This study does not include any identifiable human participants.Results Influencers were the most frequent creator identity in our data set. Influencers comprised 85.5% of the 147 TikToks in our final data set. We coded 79 female (54%) and 45 male (31%) influencers. We found male influencers created the most played (mean 8,114,706), and most liked (mean 1,510,585) TikToks. We found content themes varied by influencer gender. The notable findings were (a) the greater use of humour by males (22.7% males; n=10, and females 12.6%; n=10); and (b) inspiration (38.7%; males n=17; and 13.9%; females n=11). Among female influencers, we identified self-disclosure as the most common theme (n= 40 and 50.7% compared with n=11 and 25% male influencers). Overall, we found limited references to evidence -based anxiety self-care content in our final data set.Discussion We suggest that the TikToks in our data set were primarily directed at raising awareness of and de -stigmatising anxiety symptoms. TikTok anxiety content may be viewed by adolescents for emotional self -regulation beyond evidence-based health information seeking. Self-disclosure on TikTok may also provide symptomatic relief to adolescents with anxiety. We suggest that gender is a salient consideration when considering TikTok content. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with existing literature on adolescent social media use and epidemiological data on anxiety. This research also provides methodological insights for researchers and clinicians seeking to understand TikTok, and to develop engaging content targeted at the specific concerns and preferences of adolescent TikTok consumers.

TI  - Theme trends and knowledge structure of assisted reproductive technology and birth defects: A quantitative and co-word analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Aim The main purpose of our study is to determine the current research status of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and birth defects by means of co-word analysis, to explore the hot spots and weak points of current research, and to provide ideas and opinions for follow-up researchers.
   Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network analysis (SNA).
   Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research. For SNA results, the position status of each component is described by the center value.
   Conclusions By providing a quantitative bibliometric study, it can help with the overall command of the latest topic and guide researchers in their new projects.

TI  - Identifying Protective Health Behaviors on Twitter: Observational Study of Travel Advisories and Zika Virus
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: An estimated 3.9 billion individuals live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases.
   Objective: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease-travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling.
   Methods: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups.
   Results: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information.
   Conclusions: Our findings have implications for informing the ways in which public health organizations communicate with the public on social media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - Generalized and Specific Problematic Internet Use in Central Siberia Adolescents: A School-Based Study of Prevalence, Age-Sex Depending Content Structure, and Comorbidity with Psychosocial Problems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We aimed to assess the prevalence, content structure and, psychological comorbidity of PIU in Russian adolescents. In addition, the design of our research provided an opportunity to compare demographic and psychological patterns of different forms of PIU: generalized (PIUgen) and specific problematic video game use (PUgame), as well as problematic social media use (PUsocial). Methods: This is a one-stage cross-sectional observational study of school sampling in three major Siberian cities. A total of 4514 schoolchildren aged 12-18 (mean age 14.52 +/- 1.52 years) were surveyed. The Chen Internet Addiction Scale, the Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents, and the Social Media Disorder Scale were used to identify PIU and its types. Results: The prevalence of PIUgen among adolescents in Central Siberia was 7.2%; the prevalence of PUgame was 10.4%; the prevalence of PUsocial was 8.0%. The results of structural equation modelling, as well as the correlation analysis data, suggest two possible patterns of psychosocial problems with PIU-the first one is characteristic of both PIUgen and PUsocial. The second one-which is significantly different-is characteristic of PUgame. Conclusions: Urban adolescents in Central Siberia do not differ significantly from their Asian and European peers. Our findings support the concept of rejecting the term "generalized PIU" as a single psychological construct.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This Opinion Paper wishes to provide a summary of recent findings and solutions for a better understanding of the environmental and health problems associated with COVID-19. The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come. During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19. That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general.

TI  - Associations between sexual orientation and early adolescent screen use: findings from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: To assess the association between sexual orientation and screen use (screen time and problematic screen use) in a demographically diverse national sample of early adolescents in the United States.Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from year 2 of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 10,339, 2018-2020, ages 10-14 years). Multiple linear regression analyses esti-mated the association between sexual orientation and recreational screen time, as well as problematic use of video games, social media, and mobile phones.Results: In a sample of 10,339 adolescents (48.7% female, 46.0% racial/ethnic minority), sexual minority (compared to heterosexual) identification was associated with 3.72 (95% CI 2.96-4.47) more hours of daily recreational screen time, specifically more time on television, YouTube videos, video games, texting, social media, video chat, and browsing the internet. Possible sexual minority identification (responding "maybe" to the sexual minority question) was associated with 1.58 (95% CI 0.92-2.24) more hours of screen time compared to heterosexual identification. Sexual minority and possible sexual minority identification were associated with higher problematic social media, video games, and mobile phone use. Conclusions: Sexual minority adolescents spend a disproportionate amount of time engaging in screen-based activities, which can lead to problematic screen use.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - A Twitter discourse analysis of negative feelings and stigma related to NAFLD, NASH and obesity
T2  - LIVER INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background People with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are stigmatized, partly since 'non-alcoholic' is in the name, but also because of obesity, which is a common condition in this group. Stigma is pervasive in social media and can contribute to poorer health outcomes. We examine how stigma and negative feelings concerning NAFLD/NASH and obesity manifest on Twitter.
   Methods Using a self-developed search terms index, we collected NAFLD/NASH tweets from May to October 2019 (Phase I). Because stigmatizing NAFLD/NASH tweets were limited, Phase II focused on obesity (November-December 2019). Via sentiment analysis, >5000 tweets were annotated as positive, neutral or negative and used to train machine learning-based Natural Language Processing software, applied to 193 747 randomly sampled tweets. All tweets collected were analysed.
   Results In Phase I, 16 835 tweets for NAFLD and 2376 for NASH were retrieved. Of the annotated NAFLD/NASH tweets, 97/1130 (8.6%) and 63/535 (11.8%), respectively, related to obesity and 13/1130 (1.2%) and 5/535 (0.9%), to stigma; they primarily focused on scientific discourse and unverified information. Of the 193 747 non-annotated obesity tweets (Phase II), the algorithm classified 40.0% as related to obesity, of which 85.2% were negative, 1.0% positive and 13.7% neutral.
   Conclusions NAFLD/NASH tweets mostly indicated an unmet information need and showed no clear signs of stigma. However, the negative content of obesity tweets was recurrent. As obesity-related stigma is associated with reduced care engagement and lifestyle modification, the main NAFLD/NASH treatment, stigma-reducing interventions in social media should be included in the liver health agenda.

T2  - TREMOR AND OTHER HYPERKINETIC MOVEMENTS
AB  - Background: YouTube has evolved into an important educational tool and information source for patients and their families. YouTube videos have the potential to influence the patients' health-related diagnosis and treatment decision-making. We aimed to evaluate the quality and usefulness of videos on essential tremor available on YouTube using quantitative instruments.Methods: Video searches were performed by typing the keywords 'essential tremor', 'postural tremor', 'action tremor', 'essential tremor hand', and 'essential tremor head' into the YouTube search bar. The top 30 videos were reviewed for each search term. The videos were analyzed by two independent raters using the DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems. Qualitative and quantitative data were recorded for each video.Results: A total of 83 videos were analyzed. The mean DISCERN score was 41.96 out of 75 possible points, and the mean GQS score was 2.97 out of 5 possible points. Twelve percent of the videos were categorized as very poor, 38.6% as poor, 20.5% as fair, 19.3% as good, and 9.6% as excellent. The videos containing qualitative content features, such as clear information, symptoms, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, treatment response, epidemiology, diagrams, and radiological images had significantly higher DISCERN and GQS scores.Discussion: We consider that reliable and useful content is not provided on YouTube for individuals searching for information on essential tremor. We listed the best-quality videos on this topic as a reference for healthcare practitioners and patients. Patients should always verify information provided in such videos through more reliable sources.

TI  - The 100 Most Mentioned Glaucoma Articles Online With Highest Altmetric Attention Scores
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLAUCOMA
AB  - Precis: Characteristics of the most mentioned glaucoma articles on the internet were analyzed, allowing a better understanding of the dissemination of glaucoma research to the general public.
   Purpose: The aim was to determine the 100 most mentioned articles on the internet in the field of glaucoma and analyze their characteristics.
   Materials and Methods: We identified the top 100 glaucoma articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), an automatically calculated metric for monitoring social media. Each article was evaluated for several characteristics including year of publication, title, journal name, journal impact factor (IF), article topic, article type, affiliation, and online mentions (news, blog, policy, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). Correlation analysis was conducted for AAS with these characteristics.
   Results: The selected 100 articles came from 44 journals with more than half (56%) published in ophthalmology-specific journals. There was no significant correlation between IF and number of articles in a specific journal or AAS (P > 0.1), but the number of articles in the top 100 was higher for ophthalmology journals with a higher IF (P < 0.05). Original study was the most common study type (87%), of which clinical observation study was the most common subgroup (40%). Epidemiology/risk factor and basic science were the most common article topics (each 24%), followed by medical treatment (13%). Article topics regarding medical treatment had a significantly greater AAS than other topics (P < 0.05). Of the top 5 articles, more than half (60%) were related to "Lifestyle choice" topics.
   Conclusions: There was no association between journal IF and AAS, consistent with previous studies. 90% of journals that had articles in the top 100 had a Twitter page. "Lifestyle choice" activities and other modifiable risk factors attracted significant online attention regarding glaucoma studies, with two of the top three most mentioned articles related to dietary intake. The present study thus provides a better understanding of online engagement with glaucoma research and the dissemination of this research to the general public.

TI  - Self-reported treatment effectiveness for Crohn's disease using a novel crowdsourcing web-based platform
T2  - UNITED EUROPEAN GASTROENTEROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Background and AimsInternet and social media platforms have become an unprecedented source for sharing self-experience, potentially allowing the collection and integration of health data with patient experience. StuffThatWorks (STW) is an online open platform that applies machine learning and the power of crowdsourcing, where patients with chronic medical conditions can self-report and compare their individual outcomes using a structured online questionnaire. We aimed to conduct a cross-sectional, international, crowdsourcing, artificial-intelligence (AI) web-based study of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) self-reporting their outcomes. MethodsA proprietary STW Bayesian inference model was built to measure improvement in CD severity (on scale of 1-5) for each treatment and ranked treatments using effectiveness. The effectiveness of first-line biological treatments was analyzed by multiple comparisons and by calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each treatment pair. ResultsWe included 7593 self-reported CD patients for the analysis. Most of the participants were female (75.8%) and from English-speaking countries (95.7%). Overall, anti-TNF drugs were the most reported tried treatment (52.8%). Infliximab (IFX) was ranked as the most effective treatment by the STW effectiveness model followed by bowel surgery (second), adalimumab (ADA, third), ustekinumab (UST, 4rd), and vedolizumab (VDZ, fifth). In paired comparison analyses, IFX was most effective, ADA had similar effectiveness compared to UST and all three were more effective than VDZ. ConclusionWe present the first online crowdsourcing AI platform-based study of self-reported treatment effectiveness in CD. Net-based crowdsourcing patient-reported outcome platforms can potentially help both clinicians and patients select the best treatment for their condition.

TI  - Monitoring Physical Activity Levels Using Twitter Data: Infodemiology Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Social media technology such as Twitter allows users to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions online. The growing body of social media data is becoming a central part of infodemiology research as these data can be combined with other public health datasets (eg, physical activity levels) to provide real-time monitoring of psychological and behavior outcomes that inform health behaviors. Currently, it is unclear whether Twitter data can be used to monitor physical activity levels.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of using Twitter data to monitor physical activity levels by assessing whether the frequency and sentiment of physical activity-related tweets were associated with physical activity levels across the United States.
   Methods: Tweets were collected from Twitter's application programming interface (API) between January 10, 2017 and January 2, 2018. We used Twitter's garden hose method of collecting tweets, which provided a random sample of approximately 1% of all tweets with location metadata falling within the United States. Geotagged tweets were filtered. A list of physical activity-related hashtags was collected and used to further classify these geolocated tweets. Twitter data were merged with physical activity data collected as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Multiple linear regression models were fit to assess the relationship between physical activity-related tweets and physical activity levels by county while controlling for population and socioeconomic status measures.
   Results: During the study period, 442,959,789 unique tweets were collected, of which 64,005,336 (14.44%) were geotagged with latitude and longitude coordinates. Aggregated data were obtained for a total of 3138 counties in the United States. The mean county-level percentage of physically active individuals was 74.05% (SD 5.2) and 75.30% (SD 4.96) after adjusting for age. The model showed that the percentage of physical activity-related tweets was significantly associated with physical activity levels (beta=.11; SE 0.2; P<.001) and age-adjusted physical activity (beta=.10; SE 0.20; P<.001) on a county level while adjusting for both Gini index and education level. However, the overall explained variance of the model was low (R-2 =.11). The sentiment of the physical activity-related tweets was not a significant predictor of physical activity level and age-adjusted physical activity on a county level after including the Gini index and education level in the model (P>.05).
   Conclusions: Social media data may be a valuable tool for public health organizations to monitor physical activity levels, as it can overcome the time lag in the reporting of physical activity epidemiology data faced by traditional research methods (eg, surveys and observational studies). Consequently, this tool may have the potential to help public health organizations better mobilize and target physical activity interventions.

TI  - Pathways from adolescent screen time to eating related symptoms: a multilevel longitudinal mediation analysis through self-esteem
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH
AB  - Objective Screen time and self-esteem have been shown to be important correlates of eating disorders in adolescence. However, there is an absence of longitudinal studies that distinguish between time-varying factors, accounting for parallel developmental changes and common underlying vulnerability. Design A total of 3,801 adolescents were administered self-report measures, annually, over the course of 5 years. The association of screen time (social media use, television watching, video gaming) on eating related symptoms was analyzed using a longitudinal Bayesian multilevel path analysis framework. Self-esteem was examined as a mediating factor in this model. This study investigated direct and indirect associations at between-person, concurrent within-person, and lagged-within-person levels, while controlling for gender. Results The findings revealed that all types of screen time exposure were significantly associated with eating related symptoms at between and within-person levels. A significant association at the lagged-within person level was only revealed for social media use. Self-esteem was found to be a significant mediating factor between screen time and eating related symptoms. Conclusion An increase in social media use one year was associated with increased of eating related symptoms two years later through lower self-esteem. Implications for prevention are discussed.

TI  - Digital orphans: Data closure and openness in patient-powered networks
T2  - BIOSOCIETIES
AB  - In this paper, we discuss an issue linked to data-sharing regimes in patient-powered, social-media-based networks, namely that most of the data that patient users share are not used to research scientific issues or the patient voice. This is not a trivial issue, as participation in these networks is linked to openness in data sharing, which would benefit fellow patients and contributes to the public good more generally. Patient-powered research networks are often framed as disrupting research agendas and the industry. However, when data that patients share are not accessible for research, their epistemic potential is denied. The problem is linked to the business models of the organisations managing these networks: models centred on controlling patient data tend to close networks with regard to data use. The constraint on research is at odds with the ideals of a sharing, open and supportive epistemic community that networks' own narratives evoke. This kind of failure can create peculiar scenarios, such as the emergence of the 'digital orphans' of Internet research. By pointing out the issue of data use, this paper informs the discussion about the capacity of patient-powered networks to support research participation and the patient voice.

TI  - Content and quality analysis of videos about multiple sclerosis on social media: The case of YouTube
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Background: YouTube (YT) has grown into the largest online video platform across the world. Known to have more than two billion users of all ages, YT also serves as an important educational tool and information source for patients and their families. YT videos have the potential to influence patients' understanding of their di-agnoses and treatment decision-making.Methods: Videos were identified using the keywords "multiple sclerosis," "multiple sclerosis treatment," "re-lapsing remitting MS," and "central demyelinating disorder" in the YT search bar. For each search term, the top 30 videos were reviewed. The videos were analyzed by two independent raters using the DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems. Qualitative and quantitative data were recorded for each video.Results: A total of 99 videos were analyzed. The mean DISCERN score was 43.44 out of 75 possible points, and the mean Global Quality Scale (GQS) score was 2.77 out of 5 possible points. Of all the videos, 14.1, 29.3, 15.2, and 29.3% were categorized as very poor, poor, moderate, good, and excellent, respectively. Videos that included qualitative features such as clear information; information related to symptomatology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, treatment response, and epidemiology; and diagrams and radiological images had significantly higher scale scores. Audience engagement parameters were significantly higher for videos containing animation, treatment response, and radiological images.Conclusion: We maintain that sufficient, reliable, and useful content is not provided for those seeking information on YT about MS. Everyone seeking information about MS should always verify information provided in YT videos using more reliable sources of information. Video producers should optimize their videos to contain high-quality and reliable data and to attract larger audiences.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: Epidemiology and risk factors in the adult Saudi population of the central region
T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disease. The prevalence of IBS is estimated to be 11.2% worldwide and even though it is not a life-threatening condition, it affects the quality of life and results in an economic burden on the healthcare system. According to the Rome III criteria, IBS is described as abdominal pain that improves with defecation and the onset of the pain is associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency that cannot be explained by any biochemical or structural abnormality. Aim: To document the epidemiology of IBS and its associated risk factors in the central region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in the central region of Saudi Arabia, carried out by distributing an online self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed online in social media and websites. The sample size was 426 participants with a precision of +/- 5% and 95% confidence interval (CI). The questionnaire included demographic characters such as age, gender, occupation, and marital status. The questionnaire also included body mass index (BMI), smoking, family history of IBS, Rome III criteria for diagnosing IBS, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 426 (230 [54%] male and 196 [46%] female) participants were enrolled in the study. According to Rome III criteria, 130 had IBS and the prevalence was 30.5%. Univariate analysis showed that gender, anxiety, depression, and low physical activity are statistically significant variables with symptomatic IBS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, a high prevalence of IBS in the Central Saudi Arabia population was observed along with the presence of some modifiable risk factors, yet, the sample size was small which shows the need for more studies in this area particularly on the general population.

TI  - Self-learning on COVID-19 among medical students in Bhutan: A cross-sectional study
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: Bhutan lacks a medical school and all medical students are trained in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. When the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of medical schools in these countries in March-April 2020, the medical students were repatriated to Bhutan. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and their attitude towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. The survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Knowledge was considered "good" if the cumulative score was >= 80%, "satisfactory" if >= 60-79% and "poor" if <60%. Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response was tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1.
   Results: 120 medical students responded to the survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilation and on home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with the duration of clinical clerkship they had undertaken (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported by eight students (7%).
   Conclusions: Medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and had self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.

TI  - Scalable real-time health data sensing and analysis enabling collaborative care delivery
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB  - This work describes a novel end-to-end data ingestion and runtime processing pipeline, which is a core part of a technical solution aiming to monitor frailty indices of patients during and after treatment and improve their quality of life. The focus of this work is on the technical architectural details and the functionalities provided, which have been developed in a manner that are extensible, scalable and fault-tolerant by design. Extensibility refers to both data sources and the exact specification of analysis techniques. Our platform can combine data not only from multiple sensor types but also from electronic health records. Also, the analysis component can process the patient data both individually and in combination with other patients, while exploiting both cloud and edge resources. We have shown concrete examples of advanced analytics and evaluated the scalability of the system, which has been fully prototyped.

TI  - Who tweets what about personalised medicine? Promises and concerns from Twitter discussions in Denmark
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Digital health data are seen as valuable resources for the development of better and more efficient treatments, for instance through personalised medicine. However, health data are information about individuals who hold opinions and can challenge how data about them are used. Therefore it is important to understand public discussions around reuse of digital health data. Social media have been heralded as enabling new forms of public engagement and as a place to study social issues. In this paper, we study a public debate on Twitter about personalised medicine. We explore who participates in discussions about personalised medicine on Twitter and what they tweet about. Based on user-generated biographies we categorise users as having a 'Professional interest in personalised medicine' or as 'Private' users. We describe how users within the field tweet about the promises of personalised medicine, while users unaffiliated with the field tweet about the concrete realisation of these ambitions in the form of a new infrastructure and express concerns about the conditions for the implementation. Our study serves to remind people interested in public opinion that Twitter is a platform used for multiple purposes by different actors and not simply a bottom-up democratic forum. This study contributes with insights relevant to policymakers wishing to expand infrastructures for reuse of health data. First, by providing insights into what is discussed about health data reuse. Second, by exploring how Twitter can be used as a platform to study public discussions about reuse of health data.

TI  - Discussions of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter
T2  - PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background Experiences typically considered private, such as, miscarriages and preterm births are being discussed publicly on social media and Internet discussion websites. These data can provide timely illustrations of how individuals discuss miscarriages and preterm births, as well as insights into the wellbeing of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Here we aim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and describe the perceived emotional state of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Methods We obtained 291 443 Twitter postings on miscarriages and preterm births from January 2017 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to identify major topics of discussion. We applied time series decomposition methods to assess temporal trends and identify major drivers of discussion. Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional content of 7282 personal miscarriage disclosure tweets into the following non-mutually exclusive categories: grief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation, annoyance, and neutral. Results Topics in our data fell into eight groups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure, politics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu vaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political discussions around miscarriages were largely due to a misunderstanding between abortions and miscarriages. Grief and annoyance were the most commonly expressed emotions within the miscarriage self-disclosures; 50.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.1, 52.2) and 16.2% (95% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings increased with celebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of prescribed medications and outrage over the high rate of preterm births in the United States. Miscarriage disclosures by celebrities also led to disclosures by women who had similar experiences. Conclusions This study suggests that increase in discussions of miscarriage on social media are associated with several factors, including celebrity disclosures. Additionally, there is a misunderstanding of the potential physical, emotional and psychological impacts on individuals who lose a pregnancy due to a miscarriage.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of STDs in China: based on the GM (1,1) model
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background COVID-19 and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are two very important diseases. However, relevant researches about how COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the epidemiological trend of STDs are limited in China. This study aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on STDs in China and proposed relevant recommendations to be used in bettering health. Methods The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in China from 2008 to 2020 were collected. Grey Model (1,1) were established to predict the incidence of STDs with the incidence data of these three STDs from 2013 to 2018 considering the impact of policies in China, respectively. We then calculated the predictive incidence of each STD in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by the established Model. And we estimated the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiological changes of STDs by analyzing the difference between the absolute percentage error (APE) of the predictive incidence and actual rate in 2019 and 2020. Results The incidence of HIV infection and syphilis showed a trend of increase from 2008 to 2019 in China, but that for gonorrhea was fluctuant. Of note, the incidence of these three STDs decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2019. The APE of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea in 2020 (20.54%, 15.45% and 60.88%) were about 7 times, 4 times and 2 times of that in 2019 (2.94%, 4.07% and 30.41%). The incidence of HIV infection, syphilis and gonorrhea would be 5.77/100,000, 39.64/100,000 and 13.19/100,000 in 2021 based on our model. Conclusions The epidemiological trend of STDs in China was significant influenced by COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to balance the control of COVID-19 and timely management of STDs during the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent or reduce the poor outcome among COVID-19 patients with STDs. New management strategies on STDs, such as leveraging social media, online medical care, rapid self-testing, timely diagnosis and treatment guarantee and balance of medical resources for STDs management should be adapted in the context of the long-term effects of COVID-19.

TI  - Dataset of motivational factors for using mobile health applications and systems
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - We created and carried out a cross-sectional anonymous structured questionnaire on what motivates users of mobile health applications and wearables to share their collected health related data. The questionnaire was distributed online in English, French, and Norwegian. In addition, a flyer with information of where to locate the online questionnaire was distributed during a Swiss health conference. We used snowball sampling and encouraged participants to forward the questionnaires to friends, family, and others. Data were collected between October 2018 and March 2020. 58.1 % (n = 473) responded to the English survey, 34.3 % (n = 279) responded to the French survey, and 7.6 % (n = 62) responded to the Norwegian survey. The questionnaire contained 38 questions divided into seven themes: Background and health goals, Wearables and sensors, Mobile applications, Logging of health data, Data sharing-and integration, Social media and entertainment, and Demographics (age, gender, country of origin, chronic disease status, and chronic disease caretaker status). Answer options were single answer, multiple-choice, open-ended, or on a 4-point Likert scale. Questions were defined based on 16 in-person interviews with people without any chronic disorder, people with diabetes, and people with sickle cell disease. All questions were optional. Data were collected from 814 participants. All answers to the open-ended questions have been translated into English. This dataset is especially interesting for researchers interesting in what motivates people with and without chronic dis-ease across countries to use mHealth tools and share their collected health data. Only a subset of variables has been analyzed so far and new research questions on motivation can potentially be answered using this dataset.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Predicting the number of article citations in the field of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with the 100 top-cited articles since 2014: a bibliometric analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children or early adolescents with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 7.2%. Numerous articles related to ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100 most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations.
   Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100 most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded. Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation coefficients (CC).
   Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were research support by institutes (56%) and epidemiology (28%). The most productive countries were the United States (42%), followed by the United Kingdom (13%), Germany (9%), and the Netherlands (9%). Most articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (15%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9%). MeSH terms were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were excluded because they do not have MeSH terms).
   Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top 100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and other academic disciplines.

TI  - Exploring the effectiveness of geomasking techniques for protecting the geoprivacy of Twitter users
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB  - With the ubiquitous use of location-based services, large-scale individual-level location data has been widely collected through location-awareness devices. Geoprivacy concerns arise on the issues of user identity de-anonymization and location exposure. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of geomasking techniques for protecting the geoprivacy of active Twitter users who frequently share geotagged tweets in their home and work locations. By analyzing over 38,000 geotagged tweets of 93 active Twitter users in three U.S. cities, the two-dimensional Gaussian masking technique with proper standard deviation settings is found to be more effective to protect user's location privacy while sacrificing geospatial analytical resolution than the random perturbation masking method and the aggregation on traffic analysis zones. Furthermore, a three-dimensional theoretical framework considering privacy, analytics, and uncertainty factors simultaneously is proposed to assess geomasking techniques. Our research offers insights into geoprivacy concerns of social media users' georeferenced data sharing for future development of location-based applications and services.

TI  - Assessing Vulnerability to Surges in Suicide-Related Tweets Using Japan Census Data: Case-Only Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: As the use of social media becomes more widespread, its impact on health cannot be ignored. However, limited research has been conducted on the relationship between social media and suicide. Little is known about individuals' vulnerable to suicide, especially when social media suicide information is extremely prevalent.Objective: This study aims to identify the characteristics underlying individuals' vulnerability to suicide brought about by an increase in suicide-related tweets, thereby contributing to public health. Methods: A case-only design was used to investigate vulnerability to suicide using individual data of people who died by suicide and tweet data from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014. Mortality data were obtained from Japanese government statistics, and tweet data were provided by a commercial service. Tweet data identified the days when suicide-related tweets surged, and the date-keyed merging was performed by considering 3 and 7 lag days. For the merged data set for analysis, the logistic regression model was fitted with one of the personal characteristics of interest as a dependent variable and the dichotomous exposure variable. This analysis was performed to estimate the interaction between the surges in suicide-related tweets and personal characteristics of the suicide victims as case-only odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. For the sensitivity analysis, unexpected deaths other than suicide were considered.Results: During the study period, there were 159,490 suicides and 115,072 unexpected deaths, and the number of suicide-related tweets was 2,804,999. Following the 3-day lag of a highly tweeted day, there were significant interactions for those who were aged 40 years or younger (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15), male (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18), divorced (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 1.19), unemployed (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22), and living in urban areas (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.17 1.35). By contrast, widowed individuals had significantly lower interactions (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89). Except for unemployment, significant relationships were also observed for the 7-day lag. For the sensitivity analysis, no significant interactions were observed for other unexpected deaths in the 3-day lag, and only the widowed had a significantly larger interaction than those who were married (OR 1.08, 95%Conclusions: This study revealed the interactions of personal characteristics associated with susceptibility to suicide-related tweets. In addition, a few significant relationships were observed in the sensitivity analysis, suggesting that such an interaction is specific to suicide deaths. In other words, individuals with these characteristics, such as being young, male, unemployed, and divorced, may be vulnerable to surges in suicide-related tweets. Thus, minimizing public health strain by identifying people who are vulnerable and susceptible to a surge in suicide-related information on the internet is necessary.

TI  - Using social media to estimate Zika's impact on tourism: #babymoon, 2014-2017
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other birth defects. We hypothesized that the Latin America Zika epidemic resulted in pregnant women and their partners adopting behavioral changes to limit risk, leading them to forego travel to Zika-affected locations. We evaluated this hypothesis by studying travelers' intent and behavior through Twitter data related to babymoon: a holiday taken by parents-to-be before their baby is born. We found the odds of mentioning representative Zika-affected locations in #babymoon tweets dropped significantly (Odds ratio: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20-0.40) after the Zika-microcephaly association became well-known. This result was further corroborated through a content analysis of #babymoon tweets mentioning Zika-affected locations, which identified if the Twitter user was physically present in the Zika-affected locations. Conversely, we found a small but statistically insignificant increase in the odds of mentioning Zika-free locations from #babymoon tweets (Odds Ratio: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.97-1.27) after the Zika-microcephaly association became well-known.

TI  - Tweedle: Sensitivity Check in Health-related Social Short Texts based on Regret Theory
T2  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT TRENDS IN ADVANCED COMPUTING ICRTAC -DISRUP - TIV INNOVATION , 2019
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Recent Trends in Advanced Computing, Disruptive Innovation (ICRTAC-DTI)
AB  - Twitter helps us to know what is happening in the world and what people are talking right now. Every day, millions of Twitteraties tweet something personal or impersonal to express their emotions and valuable knowledge. In the health domain, disclosure of personal health information will have a long-term effect to common individuals either directly or indirectly, which emphasize the presence of unrealistic social boundaries and the need of sensitivity analysis in social media. The proposed Tweedle framework was built with 100K tweets extracted based on a set of 20 health-related cyber-keywords. The framework of Tweedle was bounded with Regret Theory for tweet annotation, content and contextual feature scores for feature selection and various machine learning algorithms for sensitivity classification. The tweets annotated in accordance with Regret Theory by domain experts of Amazon Mechanical Turkresulted in 61.5% of sensitive tweets with health data. The context and content-oriented features scoresare introduced in terms of Primary / Secondary tweet score, Named Entity Recognition Score of tweets, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF), Cyber-KeywordRatioin tweets, hashtag mentions, user mentions as features for classification.The Tweedle experimented Regret Theory in combination with various classifiers like Support Vector Machine, Na ve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network + Long Short-Term Memory for sensitivity classificationin health domain tweets.The training and testing results proved RNN + LSTM as the better performing model to identify tweets with sensitive health data.

TI  - Innovative field methods for residence confirmation and updating follow-up status of cancer cases: Experience from rural cancer registry, Punjab, India
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: The Sangrur population-based cancer registry, Punjab state, India experienced several challenges in confirming residence as well as updating the follow-up status of cancer cases, which is critical for accurately labelling incidence and providing cancer survival. This study presents innovative field strategies adopted by the Sangrur population-based cancer registry for residence confirmation and updating follow-up status of cancer cases. Methods: A network was developed with the involvement of local community members to validate the address and follow-up status of cancer cases. In addition, social media was used to trace patients who were loss to followup.Results: The Sangrur population-based cancer registry was unable to trace a total of 31 cancer cases. After implementing innovative field methods, 26 (83.9%) cases were successfully traced back; while 5 (16.1%) cases were untraced despite several efforts. A majority of these 31 cases were from urban areas (93.5%) compared to rural (6.5%). True Caller with the help of WhatsApp contributed significantly by tracing 9 cases (34.6%); followed by 4 cases (15.4%) traced with the help of a postman, 3 cases each (11.5%) with the electoral list and gas agency personnel, and 2 cases (7.7%) through medical shops. Also, 2 cases (7.7%) were traced with the help of treating hospital while Facebook and property tax office traced 1 case (3.8%) each.Conclusion: By engaging with the local community, and with the use of social media, the patient's residence and follow-up status can be updated. Due to this method, accurate labelling of the incidence can be achieved.

TI  - Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy, Confidence, and Public Engagement: A Global Social Listening Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Monitoring public confidence and hesitancy is crucial for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions.
   Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination.
   Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media.
   Results: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.

TI  - Understanding the COVID-19 Infodemic : Analyzing User-Generated Online Information During a COVID-19 Outbreak in Vietnam
T2  - HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives: Online misinformation has reached unprecedented levels during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study analyzed the magnitude and sentiment dynamics of misinformation and unverified information about public health interventions during a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang, Vietnam, between July and September 2020. Methods: We analyzed user-generated online information about five public health interventions during the Da Nang outbreak. We compared the volume, source, sentiment polarity, and engagements of online posts before, during, and after the outbreak using negative binomial and logistic regression, and assessed the content validity of the 500 most influential posts. Results: Most of the 54,528 online posts included were generated during the outbreak (n = 46,035; 84.42%) and by online newspapers (n = 32,034; 58.75%). Among the 500 most influential posts, 316 (63.20%) contained genuine information, 10 (2.00%) contained misinformation, 152 (30.40%) were non-factual opinions, and 22 (4.40%) contained unverifiable information. All misinformation posts were made during the outbreak, mostly on social media, and were predominantly negative. Higher levels of engagement were observed for information that was unverifiable (incidence relative risk [IRR] = 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-0.62), posted during the outbreak (before: IRR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.07-0.35; after: IRR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34-0.63), and with negative sentiment (IRR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.23-2.75). Negatively toned posts were more likely to be misinformation (odds ratio [OR] = 9.59; 95% CI, 1.20-76.70) or unverified (OR = 5.03; 95% CI, 1.66-15.24). Conclusions: Misinformation and unverified information during the outbreak showed clustering, with social media being particularly affected. This indepth assessment demonstrates the value of analyzing online "infodemics" to inform public health responses.

TI  - Patienthood and participation in the digital era
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - The 'digital era' of informatics and knowledge integration has changed the roles and experiences of patients, research participants and health consumers. No longer figured (merely) as passive recipients of healthcare services or as beneficiaries of top-down biomedical information, individuals are increasingly seen as active contributors in healthcare and research. They are positioned into multiple roles that are experienced simultaneously by those who access and co-produce digital content that can easily be transformed into data. This is contextualised by 'big data' technologies that have altered biomedicine, enabling collation and analysis of myriad data from digitised records to personal mobile data. Social media facilitate new formations of communities and knowledge enacted online, while novel kinds of commercial value emerge from digital networks that enable health data commodification. In this paper, we draw from exemplary digital era shifts towards participatory medicine to cast light on the rapprochements between patienthood, participation and consumption, and we explore how these rapprochements are mediated by, and materialise through, the use of participatory digital technologies and big data. We argue that there is a need to use new conceptual tools that account for the multiple roles and experiences of patient-participant-consumers that co-emerge through digital technologies. We must also ethically re-assess the rights and responsibilities of individuals in the digital era, and the implications of digital era changes for the future of biomedicine and healthcare.

TI  - The 10 top-cited authors who published papers in journal medicine since 2000 using the betweenness centrality to identify unique names: Bibliometric analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Numerous studies have explored the most productive and influential authors in a specific field. However, 2 challenges arise when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes.
   Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between 2000 and 2020 using the keyword "Medicine [Journal]." Author names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their research themes.
   Results: Our findings revealed the following: within the top 10 cited authors, 2 authors from China shared identical names with Jing Li and Tao-Wang; JA Winkelstein from Maryland (US) had the highest x-index (15.58); Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan was the most prolific author, having published 115 articles in Medicine since 2003; and the 3 primary research themes, namely, complications, etiology, and epidemiology, were identified using MeSH terms from the 10 most frequently cited authors.
   Conclusions: Using AWS and BC, we identified the top 10 most cited authors. The research methods we utilized in this study (BC and AWS) have the potential to be applied to other bibliometric analyses in the future.

TI  - A Review and Quality Assessment of TikTok Videos for Burn Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
AB  - Social media platforms can serve as a readily accessible tool for burn education, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of burn injuries. Previous studies have investigated the quality of online burn education videos on platforms such as YouTube. Here, we review the quality of such videos on TikTok, a newer and rapidly growing platform. TikTok was searched for English videos using 29 keywords (hashtags) such as #burn, #education, #prevention, and #management. The first 30 videos per hashtag were screened. Videos were categorized by content and creator. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the included videos using the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Metrics such as views, commentary, and likes were also examined. Of 535 screened videos, 72 met inclusion criteria. 47% (n = 34) were on management, 33% (n = 31) education, and 10% (n = 7) prevention. Only 6% (n = 4) cited sources. The median GQS score was 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0). 50% (n = 36) were made by healthcare professionals with a median GQS score of 3.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0) compared to 2.0 (IQR: 2.0-3.0, max 4.0) in nonhealthcare professionals (n = 36). Viewership varied from 41 to 4.2 million views. Overall, there is a lack of high-quality educational information on TikTok. This rapidly expanding and dynamic platform may provide an opportunity to direct individuals to higher quality resources.

TI  - Role of the Built and Online Social Environments on Expression of Dining on Instagram
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Online social communities are becoming windows for learning more about the health of populations, through information about our health-related behaviors and outcomes from daily life. At the same time, just as public health data and theory has shown that aspects of the built environment can affect our health-related behaviors and outcomes, it is also possible that online social environments (e.g., posts and other attributes of our online social networks) can also shape facets of our life. Given the important role of the online environment in public health research and implications, factors which contribute to the generation of such data must be well understood. Here we study the role of the built and online social environments in the expression of dining on Instagram in Abu Dhabi; a ubiquitous social media platform, city with a vibrant dining culture, and a topic (food posts) which has been studied in relation to public health outcomes. Our study uses available data on user Instagram profiles and their Instagram networks, as well as the local food environment measured through the dining types (e.g., casual dining restaurants, food court restaurants, lounges etc.) by neighborhood. We find evidence that factors of the online social environment (profiles that post about dining versus profiles that do not post about dining) have different influences on the relationship between a user's built environment and the social dining expression, with effects also varying by dining types in the environment and time of day. We examine the mechanism of the relationships via moderation and mediation analyses. Overall, this study provides evidence that the interplay of online and built environments depend on attributes of said environments and can also vary by time of day. We discuss implications of this synergy for precisely-targeting public health interventions, as well as on using online data for public health research.

TI  - COVID-19 on Instagram: A content analysis of selected accounts
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize the representation of public health information related to COVID-19 posted on Instagram in 2020.
   Methods: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in Iran as one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Data were collected from the contents published from February 19 to April 3, 2020, on Instagram. The search feature of the Instagram app was used to find the posts related to Coronavirus or COVID-19. Overall, 1612 posts from 92 accounts were retrieved and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: A total of 23 themes emerged from the analysis of the retrieved posts. These themes include epidemiology and statistics, training and caring, general prevention guidelines, hygiene, healthy diet and lifestyle, patients, diagnosis and treatment, personal protective equipment, traditional medicine, psychol-ogy, children, cultural aspects, socio-cultural impacts, religious, misinformation, and wrong behaviors, an-imals, satire, condition of the healthcare system, politics, quarantine, operations of the Iranian National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO), economic impacts, and world news.
   Conclusion: The contents analysis of Instagram posts during a public health crisis can provide new and realistic insights into the crisis and identify the topics of interest or concern of the public. Furthermore, the information collected in this way can help policymakers identify the most critical issues from the public perspective and utilize the gained knowledge to manage the ongoing and future pandemics.

TI  - Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity. Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways, though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p < 0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon heterogeneities in network connectivity.

TI  - Understanding the Comorbidity of Multiple Chronic Diseases Using a Network Approach
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COMPUTER SCIENCE WEEK MULTICONFERENCE (ACSW 2019)
CP  - Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference (ACSW)
AB  - Chronic diseases and associated conditions are the leading causes of death in most of the countries worldwide. Due to this, governments all over the world are concerned about the burden of chronic diseases. These diseases often pose severe health risks to the patients when they suffer from more than one chronic disease at the same time (also named as comorbidity of chronic disease). Several prediction approaches utilizing routinely collected administrative healthcare data have been developed for the prevention and better management of comorbidity. Most studies to date have focused on understanding the progression of single chronic disease rather than multiple chronic diseases. In this study, a research framework is proposed using social network analysis and graph theory using administrative healthcare data to understand the comorbidity of two chronic diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) leading to the development of cardiovascular disease). The results show that diseases related to blood (e.g., high blood pressure or high cholesterol) and kidney disease occurred frequently during the progression of cardiovascular disease for the T2D patients. The proposed framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and health insurers to adopt appropriate prevention or management program for the patients at high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.

TI  - The Feasibility and Utility of Harnessing Digital Health to Understand Clinical Trajectories in Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder: D-TECT Study Design and Methodological Considerations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction: Across the U.S., the prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) and the rates of opioid overdoses have risen precipitously in recent years. Several effective medications for OUD (MOUD) exist and have been shown to be life-saving. A large volume of research has identified a confluence of factors that predict attrition and continued substance use during substance use disorder treatment. However, much of this literature has examined a small set of potential moderators or mediators of outcomes in MOUD treatment and may lead to over-simplified accounts of treatment non-adherence. Digital health methodologies offer great promise for capturing intensive, longitudinal ecologically-valid data from individuals in MOUD treatment to extend our understanding of factors that impact treatment engagement and outcomes. Methods: This paper describes the protocol (including the study design and methodological considerations) from a novel study supported by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This study (D-TECT) primarily seeks to evaluate the feasibility of collecting ecological momentary assessment (EMA), smartphone and smartwatch sensor data, and social media data among patients in outpatient MOUD treatment. It secondarily seeks to examine the utility of EMA, digital sensing, and social media data (separately and compared to one another) in predicting MOUD treatment retention, opioid use events, and medication adherence [as captured in electronic health records (EHR) and EMA data]. To our knowledge, this is the first project to include all three sources of digitally derived data (EMA, digital sensing, and social media) in understanding the clinical trajectories of patients in MOUD treatment. These multiple data streams will allow us to understand the relative and combined utility of collecting digital data from these diverse data sources. The inclusion of EHR data allows us to focus on the utility of digital health data in predicting objectively measured clinical outcomes. Discussion: Results may be useful in elucidating novel relations between digital data sources and OUD treatment outcomes. It may also inform approaches to enhancing outcomes measurement in clinical trials by allowing for the assessment of dynamic interactions between individuals' daily lives and their MOUD treatment response.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the United States: Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
   Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.
   Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.

TI  - A Framework to Understand the Progression of Cardiovascular Disease for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Using a Network Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased worldwide. Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.

TI  - Citizens' views on sharing their health data: the role of competence, reliability and pursuing the common good
T2  - BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Background In this article, we address questions regarding how people consider what they do or do not consent to and the reasons why. This article presents the findings of a citizen forum study conducted by the University of Geneva in partnership with the Geneva University Hospitals to explore the opinions and concerns of members of the public regarding predictive oncology, genetic sequencing, and cancer. Methods This paper presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A research tool titled "the mechanics of consent" was designed for this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control while sharing different types of data with different actors. Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from the discussion amongst participants. Discussion Choice and control of personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research participants shall include information about potential risks and benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent, reliable, and honest manner. Governance systems ought to be better equipped to address ethical issues raise by the growing presence of non-traditional research actors, consent of exchanges of data via digital devices and online activity such as social media and fairness of data trading. Finally, informed consent is one of the various elements that contribute to conducting ethical research. More needs to be done to strengthen governance and ensure adequate protection of research participants, particularly to address issues related to predictive health analytics.

TI  - A Transdisciplinary Analysis of COVID-19 in Italy: The Most Affected Country in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - As of 27 March 2020, 199 countries and territories and one international conveyance are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the same date, Italy represents the third country worldwide in total number of cases and the first one in total number of deaths. The purpose of this study is to analyse the Italian case and identify key problem questions and lessons learned from the Italian experience. The study initially provides a general overview of the country's characteristics and health care system, followed by a detailed description of the Italian epidemiological picture regarding COVID-19. Afterwards, all non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by the Government against COVID-19 are presented in chronological order. The study explores some estimations of the economic impact of the epidemic, as well as its implications for society, lifestyle, and social media reactions. Finally, the study refers to two types of mathematical models to predict the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 disease. Having considered all of the above-mentioned aspects, some significant issues can be raised, including the following: (1) the available epidemiological data presents some gaps and potential biases; (2) mathematical models always come with high levels of uncertainty; (3) the high number of deaths should be interpreted in light of the national demographic context; and (4) the long-term management of the epidemic remains an open question. In conclusion, the Italian experience definitely highlights the importance of preparedness and early action, effective interventions and risk communication.

TI  - DUI: the drug use insights web server
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation: Substance abuse constitutes one of the major contemporary health epidemics. Recently, the use of social media platforms has garnered interest as a novel source of data for drug addiction epidemiology. Often however, the language used in such forums comprises slang and jargon. Currently, there are no publicly available resources to automatically analyze the esoteric language-use in the social media drug-use sub-culture. This lacunae introduces critical challenges for interpreting, sensemaking and modeling of addiction epidemiology using social media.
   Results: Drug-Use Insights (DUI) is a public and open-source web application to address the aforementioned deficiency. DUI is underlined by a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing 108 different addiction related categories consisting of over 9000 terms, where each category encompasses a set of semantically related terms. These categories and terms were established by utilizing thematic analysis in conjunction with term embeddings generated from 7 472 545 Reddit posts made by 1 402 017 redditors. Given post(s) from social media forums such as Reddit and Twitter, DUI can be used foremost to identify constituent terms related to drug use. Furthermore, the DUI categories and integrated visualization tools can be leveraged for semantic- and exploratory analysis. To the best of our knowledge, DUI utilizes the largest number of substance use and recovery social media posts used in a study and represents the first significant online taxonomy of drug abuse terminology.

TI  - Nationwide web survey of pediatric scalds: Prevalence and the relationship with household vacuum flasks
T2  - BURNS
AB  - Objective: To explore the prevalence of pediatric (0-72 months old) scalds, and to clarify its relationship with household vacuum flasks.
   Methods: A cross sectional online survey based on the largest social media in China. Online questionnaire was pushed twice a day to our target respondents for successive seven days. We were authorized to gain, analyze and publish the information related to this research by the Sina & Weibo data center.
   Results: Prevalence of pediatric scalds was 5.5%. Gender ratio (boy to girl) was 1.96: 1. Toddlers (12-36 months old) were the most susceptible age group (54.5%). Non-intentional water spill was the main causation (77.3%). An extremely low percent (7.1%) of the parents performed first-aid as described by the "RRICH" rule: water rinse-clothes remove-water immersion-clean cover-hospital. Scars developed in 52.7% patients and 14.7% of them underwent reconstructive surgery. There were 75.5% Chinese families using vacuum flasks in daily life, but only 6.1% families used the fastening device to avoid burns.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of pediatric scalds (0-72 months old) was rather high, which might be related to the extensive insecure usage of household vacuum flasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

TI  - Childhood Agricultural Injury Prevention Among Organic Farmer Mothers
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMEDICINE
AB  - Purpose: Rates of organic farms and women organic farmers are increasing. Yet, this recent surge brings new and uncertain challenges for injury epidemiology. Since many in the population are of child-bearing age, and child agricultural injury is a significant threat, of particular relevance are the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs towards risk of child injury. Methods: A paper, self-administered 11-question questionnaire was distributed at four events geared towards early career women organic farmers. The questionnaire generated data around select demographics, attitudes towards farm safety, and sources of safety knowledge. Findings & Discussion: The questionnaire had a 45% response rate. As expected, most respondents were new to farming (1-3 years' experience as a primary owner/operator), and 47% reported having a child under the age of 18 years work on the farm. While respondents recognized farms were generally unsafe for children, they reported their own farm as safe for children. Preferred sources of safety knowledge were those with user-generated content from other farmers. Conclusion: Interventions with new women organic farmers in the Midwest are likely to be most effective by incorporating social media, networking with area farmers' groups, and addressing the optimism bias. Information not explicitly marketed as safety information may gain traction. A more complete analysis of risk, incidence, and prevalence of this niche population is important.

TI  - Epidemiology of High Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) injuries in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB  - Background High intensity functional training (HIFT), usually called CrossFit, is a physical training that has gained much popularity in the past few years. The risk of acute and overuse injuries in HIFT is unclear. This study evaluated the incidence of injuries in HIFT, characterizing severity, location, and associated risk factors. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted between January and May 2021. HIFT practitioners were recruited through social media and answered an online questionnaire on training characteristics and injury history. Results A total of 606 subjects (264 male and 342 female) were included. The average age of the participants was 29.78 +/- 7.14 years. The mean height was 169.60 +/- 8.96 cm, and the mean body mass was 73.69 +/- 13.11 kg. Overall, participants were involved in HIFT for an average of 25.36 +/- 20.29 months. A total of 58.6% of participants took part in 5 to 6 training sessions per week, 31.7% practiced 5 to 6 h per week. 62.7% of the responders performed other physical activities in parallel, 98.2% performed warm-up before the training, and a formal cooldown was accomplished by 29.4% of participants. 6.8% of athletes followed individual worksheets. 45.9% of participants participated in competition. Conclusions The overall rate of injuries was 3.51/1000 h. 59.2% of subjects experienced two or more injuries. The shoulder was involved in 21.3% of cases, lower back in 18.3%, and the knee in 13.4%. No difference was found in injury rate between males and females. Experienced athletes were more prone to injury compared to those who trained under 12 months. Approximately the half of injuries did not cause training interruption. No difference was found in injury rate between males and females. The purpose of the participant did not impact the injury rate, nor did the practice of warm-up and cooldown, the time of weekly training, the league and level of competition. Finally, the participation in other sports in parallel did not demonstrated association with the injury occurrence.

   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey focused on self-reported neighborhood characteristics, perceived stress, and feasibility of obtaining work/residential addresses via online recruitment in St. Louis, Missouri, USA from February 2017 to December 2017. We report the process of using Facebook recruitment and demonstrate how this strategy can enhance collection of geospatial data to better understand context and spatial patterns of disease.
   Results: A total of 425 participants were recruited via Facebook advertisements. All participants reported their residential and work ZIP codes, though only 64.7% and 45.6% provided their complete residential and work street addresses, respectively. Those who reported their complete residential street addresses were more likely to be female (69.8% vs. 56.1% of males, chi(2) = 7.89, 1 df, p = 0.005), though no differences were observed by race, age, or employment status.
   Discussion: These findings indicate that valuable location data can be successfully collected via Facebook recruitment - data that could potentially include residential history or prospective follow-up time or be combined with other emerging technologies for geographic data in order to better understand the context and the effects of place on health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Facebook recruitment may be an underutilized resource for obtaining accurate geospatial and contextually relevant health data and should be considered as a means for finding participants due to the cost-effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of this recruitment approach.

TI  - Emergency Physician Twitter Use in the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Potential Predictor of Impending Surge: Retrospective Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The early conversations on social media by emergency physicians offer a window into the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: This retrospective observational study of emergency physician Twitter use details how the health care crisis has influenced emergency physician discourse online and how this discourse may have use as a harbinger of ensuing surge.
   Methods: Followers of the three main emergency physician professional organizations were identified using Twitter's application programming interface. They and their followers were included in the study if they identified explicitly as US-based emergency physicians. Statuses, or tweets, were obtained between January 4, 2020, when the new disease was first reported, and December 14, 2020, when vaccination first began. Original tweets underwent sentiment analysis using the previously validated Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool as well as topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation unsupervised machine learning. Sentiment and topic trends were then correlated with daily change in new COVID-19 cases and inpatient bed utilization.
   Results: A total of 3463 emergency physicians produced 334,747 unique English-language tweets during the study period. Out of 3463 participants, 910 (26.3%) stated that they were in training, and 466 of 902 (51.7%) participants who provided their gender identified as men. Overall tweet volume went from a pre-March 2020 mean of 481.9 (SD 72.7) daily tweets to a mean of 1065.5 (SD 257.3) daily tweets thereafter. Parameter and topic number tuning led to 20 tweet topics, with a topic coherence of 0.49. Except for a week in June and 4 days in November, discourse was dominated by the health care system (45,570/334,747, 13.6%). Discussion of pandemic response, epidemiology, and clinical care were jointly found to moderately correlate with COVID-19 hospital bed utilization (Pearson r=0.41), as was the occurrence of "covid," "coronavirus," or "pandemic" in tweet texts (r=0.47). Momentum in COVID-19 tweets, as demonstrated by a sustained crossing of 7- and 28-day moving averages, was found to have occurred on an average of 45.0 (SD 12.7) days before peak COVID-19 hospital bed utilization across the country and in the four most contributory states.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 Twitter discussion among emergency physicians correlates with and may precede the rising of hospital burden. This study, therefore, begins to depict the extent to which the ongoing pandemic has affected the field of emergency medicine discourse online and suggests a potential avenue for understanding predictors of surge.

TI  - Methods to madness: The utility of complex systems science in a mad, mad world
T2  - COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Existing methods in social [oral] epidemiology primarily utilize statistical models that assume static characteristics of individuals and environments. While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients, healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively. This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods into the population oral health sciences.

TI  - A Second Pandemic? Perspective on Information Overload in the COVID-19 Era
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the globe in previously unimaginable ways, with far-reaching economic and social implications. It has also led to an outpouring of daily, ever-changing information. To assess the amount of data that were emerging, a PubMed search related to COVID-19 was performed. Nearly 8000 articles have been published since the virus was defined 4 months ago. This number has grown exponentially every month, potentially hindering our ability to discern what is scientifically important. Unlike previous global pandemics, we exist in a world of instantaneous access. Information, accurate or otherwise, is flowing from one side of the world to the other via word of mouth, social media, news, and medical journals. Changes in practice guidelines should be based on high-quality, well-powered research. Our job as health care providers is to mitigate misinformation and provide reassurance to prevent a second pandemic of misinformation.

TI  - An integrative literature review of birth cohort and time period trends in adolescent depression in the United States
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this literature review is to examine evidence of time trends and birth cohort effects in depressive disorders and symptoms among US adolescents in peer-reviewed articles from January 2004 to April 2022.MethodsWe conducted an integrative systematic literature review. Three reviewers participated at different stages of article review. Of the 2234 articles identified in three databases (Pubmed, ProQuest Central, Ebscohost), 10 met inclusion criteria (i.e., adolescent aged United States populations, included information about birth cohort and survey year, focused on depressive symptoms/disorders).ResultsAll 10 articles observed increases in depressive symptoms and disorders in adolescents across recent survey years with increases observed between 1991 and 2020. Of the 3 articles that assessed birth cohort trends, birth cohort trends were less prominent than time period trends. Proposed explanations for increases included social media, economic-related reasons, changes in mental health screening and diagnosis, declining mental health stigma, increased treatment, and, in more recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionsMultiple cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies documented rising prevalence of depressive symptoms and disorder among adolescents from 1991 to 2020. Mechanisms driving this increase are still unknown. Research to identify these mechanisms is needed to inform depression screening and intervention efforts for adolescents.

TI  - Cognitive and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19: analysis of person-generated longitudinal health data from a community-based registry
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To describe cognitive symptoms in people not hospitalised at study enrolment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated demographics, medical history, other neuropsychiatric symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
   Design Longitudinal observational study.
   Setting Direct-to-participant registry with community-based recruitment via email and social media including Google, Facebook and Reddit, targeting adult US residents. Demographics, medical history, COVID-19-like symptoms, tests and vaccinations were collected through enrolment and follow-up surveys.
   Participants Participants who reported positive COVID-19 test results between 15 December 2020 and 13 December 2021. Those with cognitive symptoms were compared with those not reporting such symptoms.
   Main outcome measure Self-reported cognitive symptoms (defined as 'feeling disoriented or having trouble thinking' from listed options or related written-in symptoms)
   Results Of 3908 participants with a positive COVID-19 test result, 1014 (25.9%) reported cognitive symptoms at any time point during enrolment or follow-up, with approximately half reporting moderate/severe symptoms. Cognitive symptoms were associated with other neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dysgeusia, anosmia, trouble waking up, insomnia, headache, anxiety and depression. In multivariate analyses, female sex (OR, 95% CI): 1.7 (1.3 to 2.2), age (40-49 years (OR: 1.5 (1.2-1.9) compared with 18-29 years), history of autoimmune disease (OR: 1.5 (1.2-2.1)), lung disease (OR: 1.7 (1.3-2.2)) and depression (OR: 1.4 (1.1-1.7)) were associated with cognitive symptoms. Conversely, black race (OR: 0.6 (0.5-0.9)) and COVID-19 vaccination before infection (OR: 0.6 (0.4-0.7)) were associated with reduced occurrence of cognitive symptoms.
   Conclusions In this study, cognitive symptoms among COVID-19-positive participants were associated with female gender, age, autoimmune disorders, lung disease and depression. Vaccination and black race were associated with lower occurrence of cognitive symptoms. A constellation of neuropsychiatric and psychological symptoms occurred with cognitive symptoms. Our findings suggest COVID-19's full health and economic burden may be underestimated.

TI  - Observations of the global epidemiology of COVID-19 from the prepandemic period using web-based surveillance: a cross-sectional analysis
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background Scant data are available about global patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread and global epidemiology of early confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China. We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic.
   Methods Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies. Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were abstracted. Countries with at least one case were dassified as affected. Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100 cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and duster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings.
   Findings Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries; 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73%) were early cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2%) of 1200 cases were in health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 2.6 cases per cluster [range 2-71), followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 4.3 cases per cluster [2-141), and community gatherings (11[11%]; mean 14.2 cases per cluster [4-36]).
   Interpretation Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases from affected countries. Among cases with age information available, most were among adults aged 18 years and older. Although there were many dusters of household transmission among early cases, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be larger, supporting a possible role for physical distancing to slow the progression of SARS-CoV-2 spread.

TI  - Understanding the Progression of Congestive Heart Failure of Type 2 Diabetes Patient Using Disease Network and Hospital Claim Data
T2  - COMPLEX NETWORKS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS VIII, VOL 2
CP  - 8th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications (COMPLEX NETWORKS)
AB  - Chronic diseases have increasingly become common and caused most of the burden of ill health in most countries. They have large impacts on quality of life, social and economic conditions. These diseases bring several health risks to those patients suffering from more than one chronic disease at one time (also known as comorbidity of chronic disease). Due to this, governments and healthcare service providers are concerned about the burden of comorbidity of chronic diseases. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide vital information for the prevention and better management of chronic diseases. The routinely collected hospital claim data contain semantic information about patients' health in the form of disease codes. Therefore, these data can be used to understand the progression of chronic disease comorbidities. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple chronic diseases. In this study, we aim to understand the progression of multiple chronic diseases, i.e., comorbidities that occur when patients of one chronic condition progress towards another. Based on the prevalence of chronic diseases within the Australian population, we have particularly focused on the comorbidity progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. In this study, we propose a research framework to understand and represent the progression of CHF in patients with T2D using graph theory and social network analysis. We used hospital claim data drawn from the Australian healthcare context. We constructed two baseline disease networks from two cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2D and CHF and patients with only T2D). A final weighted disease network from two cohorts was then generated by giving more weights to the prevalent comorbidities in patients with T2D and CHF compared to the patients with only T2D. The results show that chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular disease and renal failure occurred frequently during the progression of CHF for T2D patients. In addition, the final disease network shows the highest transition between electrolyte disorders and renal failure. This indicates that these two diseases may be potential risk factors for the progression towards CHF in patients with T2D for this population cohort. Thus, the proposed network representation can help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and progression pattern between recurrence of T2D and CHF. Also, it can help in the efficient management of healthcare resources. The proposed framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management program for the patients at high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.

TI  - Severe Social Anxiety Among Adolescents During COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE
AB  - To study the prevalence of severe social anxiety (SSA) among a group of adolescents during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 178 adolescents attending the private clinics of the authors were screened online for the presence of SSA, by using the self-reporting format of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for children and adolescents (LSAS-CA). SSA defined as LSAS-CA scores of 80 or more was checked for statistical association with the adolescents' sociodemographic data and knowledge about the COVID-19 infection. The 18% of our participants had SSA, no correlation was found between having SSA and a acknowledging or fearing the COVID-19 morbidity. Factors associated with SSA included texting, using social media, and playing video games during the lockdown. Mitigating factors include high family socioeconomic status, history of socialization with friends, and the use of WhatsApp as a source of information about COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Investigating Individuals' Perceptions Regarding the Context Around the Low Back Pain Experience: Topic Modeling Analysis of Twitter Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) remains the leading cause of disability worldwide. A better understanding of the beliefs regarding LBP and impact of LBP on the individual is important in order to improve outcomes. Although personal experiences of LBP have traditionally been explored through qualitative studies, social media allows access to data from a large, heterogonous, and geographically distributed population, which is not possible using traditional qualitative or quantitative methods. As data on social media sites are collected in an unsolicited manner, individuals are more likely to express their views and emotions freely and in an unconstrained manner as compared to traditional data collection methods. Thus, content analysis of social media provides a novel approach to understanding how problems such as LBP are perceived by those who experience it and its impact.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to identify contextual variables of the LBP experience from a first-person perspective to provide insights into individuals' beliefs and perceptions.
   Methods: We analyzed 896,867 cleaned tweets about LBP between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. We tested and compared latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM), GPU-DMM, biterm topic model, and nonnegative matrix factorization for identifying topics associated with tweets. A coherence score was determined to identify the best model. Two domain experts independently performed qualitative content analysis of the topics with the strongest coherence score and grouped them into contextual categories. The experts met and reconciled any differences and developed the final labels.
   Results: LDA outperformed all other algorithms, resulting in the highest coherence score. The best model was LDA with 60 topics, with a coherence score of 0.562. The 60 topics were grouped into 19 contextual categories. "Emotion and beliefs" had the largest proportion of total tweets (157,563/896,867, 17.6%), followed by "physical activity" (124,251/896,867, 13.85%) and "daily life" (80,730/896,867, 9%), while "food and drink," "weather," and "not being understood" had the smallest proportions (11,551/896,867, 1.29%; 10,109/896,867, 1.13%; and 9180/896,867, 1.02%, respectively). Of the 11 topics within "emotion and beliefs," 113,562/157,563 (72%) had negative sentiment.
   Conclusions: The content analysis of tweets in the area of LBP identified common themes that are consistent with findings from conventional qualitative studies but provide a more granular view of individuals' perspectives related to LBP. This understanding has the potential to assist with developing more effective and personalized models of care to improve outcomes in those with LBP.

TI  - The experience of women infected by the COVID-19 during pregnancy in Brazil: a qualitative study protocol
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious, with the recent World Health Organization decree confirming a global public health emergency. The outcomes related to maternal and fetal health among pregnant women infected with the virus are still poorly understood. The world population has been waiting for answers and remains constantly alert about the pandemic's progress. It is not yet known what impact this pandemic experience will have on the population's mental health, especially pregnant women.
   Method: We aim to understand and discuss the experiences of women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, in relation to the illness process, community relations, and social media influences. This is a qualitative study in which we will interview women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy and received medical care from a tertiary university hospital specializing in women's health in Brazil. We will use the techniques of Semi-Directed Interviews of Open and In-depth Questions, socio-demographic and health data sheets, and Field Diaries. We will use purposive sampling and the criterion of theoretical saturation for its construction. The interviews will be conducted by phone or video call, with audio recorded for later transcription. The treatment of the data will be completed through Thematic Analysis and discussed in light of the Health Psychology framework, with the production of categories that answer the proposed research questions.
   Discussion: It is expected that the results contribute to the understanding about the demands that come to the health professional of women infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy in a pandemic situation.

TI  - Insulin pricing and other major diabetes-related concerns in the USA: a study of 46 407 tweets between 2017 and 2019
T2  - BMJ OPEN DIABETES RESEARCH & CARE
AB  - Introduction Little research has been done to systematically evaluate concerns of people living with diabetes through social media, which has been a powerful tool for social change and to better understand perceptions around health-related issues. This study aims to identify key diabetes-related concerns in the USA and primary emotions associated with those concerns using information shared on Twitter.
   Research design and methods A total of 11.7 million diabetes-related tweets in English were collected between April 2017 and July 2019. Machine learning methods were used to filter tweets with personal content, to geolocate (to the USA) and to identify clusters of tweets with emotional elements. A sentiment analysis was then applied to each cluster.
   Results We identified 46 407 tweets with emotional elements in the USA from which 30 clusters were identified; 5 clusters (18% of tweets) were related to insulin pricing with both positive emotions (joy, love) referring to advocacy for affordable insulin andsadnessemotions related to the frustration of insulin prices, 5 clusters (12% of tweets) to solidarity and support with a majority ofjoyandloveemotions expressed. The most negative topics (10% of tweets) were related to diabetes distress (24%sadness,27%anger, 21%fearelements), to diabetic and insulin shock (45%anger, 46%fear) and comorbidities (40%sadness).
   Conclusions Using social media data, we have been able to describe key diabetes-related concerns and their associated emotions. More specifically, we were able to highlight the real-world concerns of insulin pricing and its negative impact on mood. Using such data can be a useful addition to current measures that inform public decision making around topics of concern and burden among people with diabetes.

AB  - Background In the non-interferon era, many patients still remain untested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our aim was to determine if media coverage, number and type of news, can influence the rate of HCV testing.
   Methods For each calendar year we searched from national, regional and local newspapers for articles published related to HCV between 2001 and 2013 (interferon era) and 2014-2018 (non-interferon era) and the HCV tests performed. Demographics, provider data and test result were collected from patients tested.
   Results During the studied period, 21 913 press articles were found, and we identified a total of 293 226 HCV tests. A total of 9778 HCV tests from 5237 patients tested positive (1.88%). An inverse correlation was found between media coverage and the number of HCV tests during the interferon era (r(2) = -0.558, P = 0.024), where news concerning epidemiology and burden of the disease were more frequent. By contrast, in the non-interferon era a strong correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.900, P = 0.019), where news related to treatment prevailed.
   Conclusion Our results show that media coverage on HCV fluctuate so the type of news. It remains to be prospectively evaluated if well designed publicity campaigns about the benefits of HCV screening and treatment influences on HCV testing.

TI  - Kitesurf injury trauma evaluation study: A prospective cohort study evaluating kitesurf injuries
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Kitesurfing is an increasingly popular and potentially dangerous extreme water sport. We hypothesized that kitesurfing has a higher injury rate than other (contact) sports and that the minority of injuries are severe.
   AIM
   To investigate the incidence and epidemiology of kitesurfing injuries in a Dutch cohort during a complete kitesurfing season.
   METHODS
   Injury data of 194 kitesurfers of various skill levels, riding styles and age were surveyed prospectively during a full kitesurf season. The participants were recruited through the Dutch national kitesurf association, social media, local websites and kitesurf schools. Participants completed digital questionnaires monthly. The amount of time kitesurfing was registered along with all sustained injuries. If an injury was reported, an additional questionnaire explored the type of injury, injury location, severity and the circumstances under which the injury occurred.
   RESULTS
   The mean age of participants was 31 years (range, 13-59) and the majority of the study population was male (74.2%). A total of 177 injuries were sustained during 16816 kitesurf hours. The calculated injury rate was 10.5 injuries per 1000 h of kitesurfing. The most common injuries were cuts and abrasions (25.4%), followed by contusions (19.8%), joint sprains (17.5%) and muscle sprains (10.2%). The foot and ankle were the most common site of injury (31.8%), followed by the knee (14.1%) and hand and wrist (10.2%). Most injuries were reported to occur during a trick or jump. Although the majority of injuries were mild, severe injuries like an anterior cruciate ligament tear, a lumbar spine fracture, a bimalleolar ankle fracture and an eardrum rupture were reported.
   CONCLUSION
   The injury rate of kitesurfing is in the range of other popular (contact) sports. Most injuries are relatively mild, although kitesurfing has the potential to cause serious injuries.

TI  - Study protocol: building an evidence base for epidemiology emergency response, a mixed-methods study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Determinants and drivers for emergencies, such as political instability, weak health systems, climate change and forcibly displaced populations, are increasing the severity, complexity and frequency of public health emergencies. As emergencies become more complex, it is increasingly important that the required skillset of the emergency response workforce is clearly defined. To enable essential epidemiological activities to be implemented and managed during an emergency, a workforce is required with the right mix of skills, knowledge, experience and local context awareness. This study aims to provide local and international responders with an opportunity to actively contribute to the development of new thinking around emergency response roles and required competencies. In this study, we will develop recommendations using a broad range of evidence to address identified lessons and challenges so that future major emergency responses are culturally and contextually appropriate, and less reliant on long-term international deployments.
   Method and analysis We will conduct a mixed-methods study using an exploratory sequential study design. The integration of four data sources, including key informant interviews, a scoping literature review, survey and semistructured interviews will allow the research questions to be examined in a flexible, semistructured way, from a range of perspectives. The study is unequally weighted, with a qualitative emphasis. We will analyse all activities as individual components, and then together in an integrated analysis. Thematic analysis will be conducted in NVivo V.11 and quantitative analysis will be conducted in Stata V.15.
   Ethics and dissemination All activities have been approved by the Science and Medical Delegated Ethics Review Committee at the Australian National University (protocol numbers 2018-521, 2018-641, 2019-068). Findings will be disseminated through international and local deployment partners, peer--reviewed publication, presentation at international conferences and through social media such as Twitter and Facebook.

TI  - Post-treatment surveillance testing of patients with colorectal cancer and the association with survival: protocol for a retrospective cohort study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Although the colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rate has significantly improved over the past several decades, many patients will have a recurrence following curative treatment. Despite this high risk of recurrence, adherence to CRC surveillance testing guidelines is poor which increases cancer-related morbidity and potentially, mortality. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with varying surveillance strategies have yielded conflicting evidence regarding the survival benefit associated with surveillance testing. However, due to differences in study protocols and limitations of sample size and length of follow-up, the RCT may not be the best study design to evaluate this relationship. An observational comparative effectiveness research study can overcome the sample size/follow-up limitations of RCT designs while assessing realworld variability in receipt of surveillance testing to provide much needed evidence on this important clinical issue. The gap in knowledge that this study will address concerns whether adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network CRC surveillance guidelines improves survival.
   Methods and analysis Patients with colon and rectal cancer aged 66-84 years, who have been diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 and have been included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, are eligible for this retrospective cohort study. To minimise bias, patients had to survive at least 12 months following the completion of treatment. Adherence to surveillance testing up to 5 years post-treatment will be assessed in each year of follow-up and overall. Binomial regression will be used to assess the association between patients' characteristics and adherence. Survival analysis will be conducted to assess the association between adherence and 5-year survival.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the National Cancer Institute and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida. The results of this study will be disseminated by publishing in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, presentation at national/international scientific conferences and posting through social media.

TI  - COVID-19 early-alert signals using human behavior alternative data
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB  - Google searches create a window into population-wide thoughts and plans not just of individuals, but populations at large. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to contain it, searches for socially distanced activities have trended. We hypothesize that trends in the volume of search queries related to activities associated with COVID-19 transmission correlate with subsequent COVID-19 caseloads. We present a preliminary analytics framework that examines the relationship between Google search queries and the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. We designed an experimental tool with search volume indices to track interest in queries related to two themes: isolation and mobility. Our goal was to capture the underlying social dynamics of an unprecedented pandemic using alternative data sources that are new to epidemiology. Our results indicate that the net movement index we defined correlates with COVID-19 weekly new case growth rate with a lag of between 10 and 14 days for the United States at-large, as well as at the state level for 42 out of 50 states with the exception of 8 states (DE, IA, KS, NE, ND, SD, WV, WY) from March to June 2020. In addition, an increasing caseload was seen over the summer in some southern US states. A sharp rise in mobility indices was followed by a sharp increase, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas. A sharp decline in mobility indices is often followed by a sharp decline, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and New York. The digital epidemiology framework presented here aims to discover predictors of the pandemic's curve, which could supplement traditional predictive models and inform early warning systems and public health policies.

TI  - The Small-World Network of College Classes: Implications for Epidemic Spread on a University Campus
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB  - To slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, many universities shifted to online instruction and now face the question of whether and how to resume in-person instruction. This article uses transcript data from a medium-sized American university to describe three enrollment networks that connect students through classes and in the process create social conditions for the spread of infectious disease: a university-wide network, an undergraduate-only network, and a liberal arts college network. All three networks are "small worlds" characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students are connected through multiple independent paths. Hybrid models of instruction can reduce but not eliminate the potential for epidemic spread through the small worlds of course enrollments.

TI  - Mechanisms accounting for gendered differences in mental health status among young Canadians: A novel quantitative analysis
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Adolescent girls consistently report worse mental health than boys. This study used reports from a 2018 national health promotion survey (n = 11,373) to quantitatively explore why such gender-based differences exist among young Canadians.Using mediation analyses and contemporary social theory, we explored mechanisms that may explain dif-ferences in mental health between adolescents who identify as boys versus girls. The potential mediators tested were social supports within family and friends, engagement in addictive social media use, and overt risk-taking. Analyses were performed with the full sample and in specific high-risk groups, such as adolescents who report lower family affluence. Higher levels of addictive social media use and lower perceived levels of family support among girls mediated a significant proportion of the difference between boys and girls for each of the three mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, frequent health complaints, and diagnosis of mental illness). Observed mediation effects were similar in high-risk subgroups; however, among those with low affluence, effects of family support were somewhat more pronounced.Study findings point to deeper, root causes of gender-based mental health inequalities that emerge during childhood. Interventions designed to reduce girls' addictive social media use or increase their perceived family support, to be more in line with their male peers, could help to reduce differences in mental health between boys and girls. Contemporary focus on social media use and social supports among girls, especially those with low affluence, warrant study as the basis for public health and clinical interventions.

TI  - Using Twitter to Detect Psychological Characteristics of Self-Identified Persons With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: More than 3.5 million Americans live with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Major challenges persist in diagnosing ASD as no medical test exists to diagnose this disorder. Digital phenotyping holds promise to guide in the clinical diagnoses and screening of ASD.
   Objective: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using the Web-based social media platform Twitter to detect psychological and behavioral characteristics of self-identified persons with ASD.
   Methods: Data from Twitter were retrieved from 152 self-identified users with ASD and 182 randomly selected control users from March 22, 2012 to July 20, 2017. We conducted a between-group comparative textual analysis of tweets about repetitive and obsessive-compulsive behavioral characteristics typically associated with ASD. In addition, common emotional characteristics of persons with ASD, such as fear, paranoia, and anxiety, were examined between groups through textual analysis. Furthermore, we compared the timing of tweets between users with ASD and control users to identify patterns in communication.
   Results: Users with ASD posted a significantly higher frequency of tweets related to the specific repetitive behavior of counting compared with control users (P<. 001). The textual analysis of obsessive-compulsive behavioral characteristics, such as fixate, excessive, and concern, were significantly higher among users with ASD compared with the control group (P<. 001). In addition, emotional terms related to fear, paranoia, and anxiety were tweeted at a significantly higher rate among users with ASD compared with control users (P<.001). Users with ASD posted a smaller proportion of tweets during time intervals of 00: 00-05: 59 (P<.001), 06: 00-11: 59 (P<.001), and 18: 00-23.59 (P<. 001), as well as a greater proportion of tweets from 12: 00 to 17: 59 (P<. 001) compared with control users.
   Conclusions: Social media may be a valuable resource for observing unique psychological characteristics of self-identified persons with ASD. Collecting and analyzing data from these digital platforms may afford opportunities to identify the characteristics of ASD and assist in the diagnosis or verification of ASD. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging digital data for gaining new insights into various health conditions.

TI  - Using Search Engine Data as a Tool to Predict Syphilis
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Researchers have suggested that social media and online search data might be used to monitor and predict syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. Because people at risk for syphilis might seek sexual health and risk-related information on the internet, we investigated associations between internet state-level search query data (e.g., Google Trends) and reported weekly syphilis cases.
   Methods: We obtained weekly counts of reported primary and secondary syphilis for 50 states from 2012 to 2014 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We collected weekly internet search query data regarding 25 risk-related keywords from 2012 to 2014 for 50 states using Google Trends. We joined 155 weeks of Google Trends data with 1-week lag to weekly syphilis data for a total of 7750 data points. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we trained three linear mixed models on the first 10 weeks of each year. We validated models for 2012 and 2014 for the following 52 weeks and the 2014 model for the following 42 weeks.
   Results: The models, consisting of different sets of keyword predictors for each year, accurately predicted 144 weeks of primary and secondary syphilis counts for each state, with an overall average R-2 of 0.9 and overall average root mean squared error of 4.9.
   Conclusions: We used Google Trends search data from the prior week to predict cases of syphilis in the following weeks for each state. Further research could explore how search data could be integrated into public health monitoring systems.

TI  - The Expert Next Door: Interactions With Friends and Family During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust the field of public health into the spotlight. For many epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and other public health professionals, this caused the professional aspects of our lives to collide with the personal, as friends and family reached out with concerns and questions. Learning how to navigate this space was new for many of us and required refining our communication style depending on context, setting, and audience. Some of us took to social media, utilizing our existing personal accounts to share information after sorting through and summarizing the rapidly emerging literature to keep loved ones safe. However, those in our lives sometimes asked unanswerable questions, or began distancing themselves when we suggested more stringent guidance than they had hoped for, causing additional stress during an already traumatic time. We often had to remind ourselves that we were also individuals experiencing this pandemic and that our time-intensive efforts were meaningful, relevant, and impactful. As this pandemic and other public health crises continue, we encourage members of our discipline to consider how we can best use shared lessons from this period and to recognize that our professional knowledge, when used in our personal lives, can promote, protect, and bolster confidence in public health.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Telehealth may Provide Early Warning of Epidemics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic produced a very sudden and serious impact on public health around the world, greatly adding to the burden of overloaded professionals and national medical systems. Recent medical research has demonstrated the value of using online systems to predict emerging spatial distributions of transmittable diseases. Concerned internet users often resort to online sources in an effort to explain their medical symptoms. This raises the prospect that incidence of COVID-19 may be tracked online by search queries and social media posts analyzed by advanced methods in data science, such as Artificial Intelligence. Online queries can provide early warning of an impending epidemic, which is valuable information needed to support planning timely interventions. Identification of the location of clusters geographically helps to support containment measures by providing information for decision-making and modeling.

TI  - Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis: A comprehensive and integrative multi-modeling approach to disease prediction and management
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - The impact of infectious disease on human populations is a function of many factors including environmental conditions, vector dynamics, transmission mechanics, social and cultural behaviors, and public policy. A comprehensive framework for disease management must fully connect the complete disease lifecycle, including emergence from reservoir populations, zoonotic vector transmission, and impact on human societies. The Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis is a software environment and conceptual architecture for data integration, situational awareness, visualization, prediction, and intervention assessment. Framework for Infectious Disease Analysis automatically collects biosurveillance data using natural language processing, integrates structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, applies advanced machine learning, and uses multi-modeling for analyzing disease dynamics and testing interventions in complex, heterogeneous populations. In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness. Classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and boosting) were used for disease predictions.

TI  - Evaluating the Global Impact of Stroke Awareness Month: A Serial Cross-Sectional Analysis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Stroke is the second-leading cause of mortality in the world and ranks fifth in terms of causes of death in the United States. "Time is brain" when it comes to the detection and treatment of a stroke as it can reduce morbidity and disability in the long run. May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were "stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR #strokemonth OR #strokewarenessmonth" and "stroke OR #stroke". Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term 'stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have been 3.14% and 1.35%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the event had primary involvement from the United States and the United Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents, especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally. The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and global health.

TI  - Uses of mHealth in Injury Prevention and Control: a Critical Review
T2  - CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Reviews The purpose of this review was to summarize the current state of the literature on the use of "mHealth" (the use of mobile devices for health promotion) for injury prevention and control. Recent Findings mHealth is being used to measure, predict, and prevent the full spectrum of injuries. However, most literature remains preliminary or in a pilot stage. Use of best-of-class design principles (e.g., user-centered design, theory-based development) is uncommon, and wide-scale dissemination of effective monitoring or intervention tools is rare. mHealth for injury prevention holds promise, but further work is needed across the full spectrum of development and translation.

TI  - Scanxiety Conversations on Twitter: Observational Study
T2  - JMIR CANCER
AB  - Background: Scan-associated anxiety (or "scanxiety") is commonly experienced by people having cancer-related scans. Social media platforms such as Twitter provide a novel source of data for observational research.Objective: We aimed to identify posts on Twitter (or "tweets") related to scanxiety, describe the volume and content of these tweets, and describe the demographics of users posting about scanxiety.Methods: We manually searched for "scanxiety" and associated keywords in cancer-related, publicly available, English-language tweets posted between January 2018 and December 2020. We defined "conversations" as a primary tweet (the first tweet about scanxiety) and subsequent tweets (interactions stemming from the primary tweet). User demographics and the volume of primary tweets were assessed. Conversations underwent inductive thematic and content analysis.Results: A total of 2031 unique Twitter users initiated a conversation about scanxiety from cancer-related scans. Most were patients (n=1306, 64%), female (n=1343, 66%), from North America (n=1130, 56%), and had breast cancer (449/1306, 34%). There were 3623 Twitter conversations, with a mean of 101 per month (range 40-180). Five themes were identified. The first theme was experiences of scanxiety, identified in 60% (2184/3623) of primary tweets, which captured the personal account of scanxiety by patients or their support person. Scanxiety was often described with negative adjectives or similes, despite being experienced differently by users. Scanxiety had psychological, physical, and functional impacts. Contributing factors to scanxiety included the presence and duration of uncertainty, which was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second theme (643/3623, 18%) was the acknowledgment of scanxiety, where users summarized or labeled an experience as scanxiety without providing emotive clarification, and advocacy of scanxiety, where users raised awareness of scanxiety without describing personal experiences. The third theme was messages of support (427/3623, 12%), where users expressed well wishes and encouraged positivity for people experiencing scanxiety. The fourth theme was strategies to reduce scanxiety (319/3623, 9%), which included general and specific strategies for patients and strategies that required improvements in clinical practice by clinicians or health care systems. The final theme was research about scanxiety (50/3623, 1%), which included tweets about the epidemiology, impact, and contributing factors of scanxiety as well as novel strategies to reduce scanxiety.Conclusions: Scanxiety was often a negative experience described by patients having cancer-related scans. Social media platforms like Twitter enable individuals to share their experiences and offer support while providing researchers with unique data to improve their understanding of a problem. Acknowledging scanxiety as a term and increasing awareness of scanxiety is an important first step in reducing scanxiety. Research is needed to guide evidence-based approaches to reduce scanxiety, though some low-cost, low-resource practical strategies identified in this study could be rapidly introduced into clinical care.

TI  - A time evolving online social network generation algorithm
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The rapid growth of online social media usage in our daily lives has increased the importance of analyzing the dynamics of online social networks. However, the dynamic data of existing online social media platforms are not readily accessible. Hence, there is a necessity to synthesize networks emulating those of online social media for further study. In this work, we propose an epidemiology-inspired and community-based, time-evolving online social network generation algorithm (EpiCNet), to generate a time-evolving sequence of random networks that closely mirror the characteristics of real-world online social networks. Variants of the algorithm can produce both undirected and directed networks to accommodate different user interaction paradigms. EpiCNet utilizes compartmental models inspired by mathematical epidemiology to simulate the flow of individuals into and out of the online social network. It also employs an overlapping community structure to enable more realistic connections between individuals in the network. Furthermore, EpiCNet evolves the community structure and connections in the simulated online social network as a function of time and with an emphasis on the behavior of individuals. EpiCNet is capable of simulating a variety of online social networks by adjusting a set of tunable parameters that specify the individual behavior and the evolution of communities over time. The experimental results show that the network properties of the synthetic time-evolving online social network generated by EpiCNet, such as clustering coefficient, node degree, and diameter, match those of typical real-world online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

TI  - Addressing Extreme Imbalance for Detecting Medications Mentioned in Twitter User Timelines
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE (AIME 2021)
CP  - 19th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME)
AB  - Tweets mentioning medications are valuable for efforts in digital epidemiology to supplement traditional methods of monitoring public health. A major obstacle, however, is to differentiate them from the large majority of tweets on other topics posted in a user's timeline: solving the infamous 'needle in a haystack' problem. While deep learning models have significantly improved classification, their performance and inference processing time remain low on extremely imbalanced corpora where the tweets of interest are less than 1% of all tweets. In this study, we empirically evaluate under-sampling, fine-tuning, and filtering heuristics to train such classifiers. Using a corpus of 212 Twitter timelines (181,607 tweets with only 0.2% tweets mentioning a medication), our results show that combining these heuristics is necessary to impact the classifier's performance. In our intrinsic evaluation, a classifier based on a lexicon and a BERT-base neural network achieved a 0.838 F1-score, a score similar to the score achieved by the best classifier on this task during the #SMM4H'20 competition, but it processed the corpus 28 times faster - a positive result, since processing speed is still a roadblock to deploying classifiers on large cohorts of Twitter users needed for pharmacovigilance. In our extrinsic evaluation, our classifier helped a labeler to extract the spans of medications more accurately and achieved a 0.76 Strict F1-score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of medications extraction from Twitter timelines and it establishes the first benchmark for future studies.

TI  - Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults: Evidence From the ELSI-Brazil Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The association between social isolation and cognitive perfor-mance has been less investigated in low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC) and the presence of depression as a moderator on this association has not been examined. The authors examined the associations of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are important to assess the direction of the association between social isolation and cognitive performance. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2023; 31:610-620)

TI  - Unplanned Closure of Public Schools in Michigan, 2015-2016: Cross-Sectional Study on Rurality and Digital Data Harvesting
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
AB  - BACKGROUND For pandemic preparedness, researchers used online systematic searches to track unplanned school closures (USCs). We determine if Twitter provides complementary data.
   METHODS Twitter handles of Michigan public schools and school districts were identified. All tweets associated with these handles were downloaded. USC-related tweets were identified using 5 keywords. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were performed in R.
   RESULTS Among 3469 Michigan public schools, 2003 maintained their own active Twitter accounts or belonged to school districts with active Twitter accounts. Of these 2003 schools, in 2015-2016 school year, at least 1 USC announcement was identified for 349 schools via the current method only, 678 schools via Twitter only, and 562 schools via both methods. No USC announcements were identified for 414 schools. Rural schools were less likely than city schools to have active Twitter coverage (adjusted relative risk [adjRR] = 0.3956, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3312-0.4671), and to announce USCs on Twitter (adjRR = 0.5692, 95% CI 0.4645-0.6823), but more likely to have USCs identified by the current method (adjRR = 1.4545, 95% CI 1.3545-1.5490).
   CONCLUSIONS Each method identified USCs that were missed by the other. Our results suggested that identifying USCs on Twitter is complementary to the current method.

A1  - Curing Coma Campaign Its Contribut
TI  - The Curing Coma Campaign International Survey on Coma Epidemiology, Evaluation, and Therapy (COME TOGETHER)
T2  - NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB  - Background Although coma is commonly encountered in critical care, worldwide variability exists in diagnosis and management practices. We aimed to assess variability in coma definitions, etiologies, treatment strategies, and attitudes toward prognosis. Methods As part of the Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign, between September 2020 and January 2021, we conducted an anonymous, international, cross-sectional global survey of health care professionals caring for patients with coma and disorders of consciousness in the acute, subacute, or chronic setting. Survey responses were solicited by sequential emails distributed by international neuroscience societies and social media. Fleiss kappa values were calculated to assess agreement among respondents. Results The survey was completed by 258 health care professionals from 41 countries. Respondents predominantly were physicians (n = 213, 83%), were from the United States (n = 141, 55%), and represented academic centers (n = 231, 90%). Among eight predefined items, respondents identified the following cardinal features, in various combinations, that must be present to define coma: absence of wakefulness (81%, kappa = 0.764); Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <= 8 (64%, kappa = 0.588); failure to respond purposefully to visual, verbal, or tactile stimuli (60%, kappa = 0.552); and inability to follow commands (58%, kappa = 0.529). Reported etiologies of coma encountered included medically induced coma (24%), traumatic brain injury (24%), intracerebral hemorrhage (21%), and cardiac arrest/hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (11%). The most common clinical assessment tools used for coma included the GCS (94%) and neurological examination (78%). Sixty-six percent of respondents routinely performed sedation interruption, in the absence of contraindications, for clinical coma assessments in the intensive care unit. Advanced neurological assessment techniques in comatose patients included quantitative electroencephalography (EEG)/connectivity analysis (16%), functional magnetic resonance imaging (7%), single-photon emission computerized tomography (6%), positron emission tomography (4%), invasive EEG (4%), and cerebral microdialysis (4%). The most commonly used neurostimulants included amantadine (51%), modafinil (37%), and methylphenidate (28%). The leading determinants for prognostication included etiology of coma, neurological examination findings, and neuroimaging. Fewer than 20% of respondents reported routine follow-up of coma survivors after hospital discharge; however, 86% indicated interest in future research initiatives that include postdischarge outcomes at six (85%) and 12 months (65%). Conclusions There is wide heterogeneity among health care professionals regarding the clinical definition of coma and limited routine use of advanced coma assessment techniques in acute care settings. Coma management practices vary across sites, and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained follow-up after acute treatment are inconsistent. There is an urgent need for the development of evidence-based guidelines and a collaborative, coordinated approach to advance both the science and the practice of coma management globally.

TI  - Enhancing COVID-19 Epidemic Forecasting Accuracy by Combining Real-time and Historical Data From Multiple Internet-Based Sources: Analysis of Social Media Data, Online News Articles, and Search Queries
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The SARS-COV-2 virus and its variants pose extraordinary challenges for public health worldwide. Timely and accurate forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic is key to sustaining interventions and policies and efficient resource allocation. Internet-based data sources have shown great potential to supplement traditional infectious disease surveillance, and the combination of different Internet-based data sources has shown greater power to enhance epidemic forecasting accuracy than using a single Internet-based data source. However, existing methods incorporating multiple Internet-based data sources only used real-time data from these sources as exogenous inputs but did not take all the historical data into account. Moreover, the predictive power of different Internet-based data sources in providing early warning for COVID-19 outbreaks has not been fully explored. Objective: The main aim of our study is to explore whether combining real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve the COVID-19 forecasting accuracy over the existing baseline models. A secondary aim is to explore the COVID-19 forecasting timeliness based on different Internet-based data sources. Methods: We first used core terms and symptom-related keyword-based methods to extract COVID-19-related Internet-based data from December 21, 2019, to February 29, 2020. The Internet-based data we explored included 90,493,912 online news articles, 37,401,900 microblogs, and all the Baidu search query data during that period. We then proposed an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs, incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources. Our proposed model was compared with baseline models, and all the models were tested during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemics in Hubei province and the rest of mainland China separately. We also used lagged Pearson correlations for COVID-19 forecasting timeliness analysis.Results: Our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy in all 5 accuracy measures, compared with all the baseline models of both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China. In mainland China, except for Hubei, the COVID-19 epidemic forecasting accuracy differences between our proposed model (model i) and all the other baseline models were statistically significant (model 1, t198=-8.722, P <.001; model 2, t198=-5.000, P <.001, model 3, t198=-1.882, P=.06; model 4, t198=-4.644, P <.001; model 5, t198=-4.488, P <.001). In Hubei province, our proposed model's forecasting accuracy improved significantly compared with the baseline model using historical new confirmed COVID-19 case counts only (model 1, t198=-1.732, P=.09). Our results also showed that Internet-based sources could provide a 2-to 6-day earlier warning for COVID-19 outbreaks.Conclusions: Our approach incorporating real-time and historical data from multiple Internet-based sources could improve forecasting accuracy for epidemics of COVID-19 and its variants, which may help improve public health agencies' interventions and resource allocation in mitigating and controlling new waves of COVID-19 or other relevant epidemics.

TI  - Factors influencing hesitancy towards adult and child COVID-19 vaccines in rural and urban West Africa: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives This study aims: (1) to identify and describe similarities and differences in both adult and child COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (2) to examine sociodemographic, perception-related and behavioural factors influencing vaccine hesitancy across five West African countries.
   Design Cross-sectional survey carried out between 5 May and 5 June 2021.
   Participants and setting 4198 individuals from urban and rural settings in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone participated in the survey.
   Study registration The general protocol is registered on clinicaltrial.gov.
   Results Findings show that in West Africa at the time only 53% of all study participants reported to be aware of COVID-19 vaccines, and television (60%, n=1345), radio (56%; n=1258), social media (34%; n=764) and family/friends/neighbours (28%; n=634) being the most important sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Adult COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ranges from 60% in Guinea and 50% in Sierra Leone to 11% in Senegal. This is largely congruent with acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccinations for children. Multivariable regression analysis shows that perceived effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines increased the willingness to get vaccinated. However, sociodemographic factors, such as sex, rural/urban residence, educational attainment and household composition (living with children and/or elderly), and the other perception parameters were not associated with the willingness to get vaccinated in the multivariable regression model.
   Conclusions Primary sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines include television, radio and social media. Communication strategies addressed at the adult population using mass and social media, which emphasise COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety, could encourage greater acceptance also of COVID-19 child vaccinations in sub-Saharan countries.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria are being reported at an increasing rate in the United States. We performed a text-mining analysis to look at nearly 13,000 tweets from two foodborne Escherichia coli outbreaks in 2018. Concerns from the public included staying informed about contaminated lettuce, recognizing signs of infection, and holding responsible farms accountable. At the end of the second outbreak, comments were focused on assessing symptoms, using the traceback process to locate outbreak sources, and calling for better food labeling practices.

TI  - Analysis of the movement of live broilers in Guangxi, China and implications for avian influenza control
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Most Chinese provinces have a daily-updated database of live animal movements; however, the data are not efficiently utilized to support interventions to control H7N9 and other avian influenzas. Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20%) exporting/importing more than 90% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.

TI  - Impact of changes in clinical practice guidelines for intra-articular injection treatments for knee osteoarthritis on public interest and social media
T2  - OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE
AB  - Objective: To summarize changes in recommendations for injection treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA) in current clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and to assess whether these changes have affected public interest according to Google data and content in YouTube videos. Design: A literature search to identify CPGs revised since 2019 that provide recommendations regarding the five intra-articular injection treatments for knee OA (corticosteroid [CS], hyaluronic acid [HA], stem cell [SC], platelet-rich plasma [PRP], and botulinum toxin [BT]) was conducted to assess perspective changes for each treatment. Data from Google Trends were examined to identify changes in search volume from 2004 to 2021 using a join-point regression model. Relevant YouTube videos were divided into those uploaded before and after changes in CPGs and compared according to degrees of recom-mendation for each treatment to identify the effect of changes in CPGs on video production. Results: All eight identified CPGs released after 2019 recommended HA and CS use. Most CPGs were the first to state a neutral or opposing stance concerning the use of SC, PRP, or BT. Interestingly, relative searches on Google for SC, PRP, and BT has increased greater than those for CS and HA. YouTube videos produced after CPGs changed continue to recommend SC, PRP, and BT as much as those produced before CPGs were revised. Conclusions: Although knee OA CPGs have changed, public interest and healthcare information providers on YouTube have not reacted to this shift. Improved methods to propagate updates to CPGs warrant consideration.(c) 2023 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Direct and Indirect Associations of Media Use With COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in South Korea: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has not concluded. Despite the availability of vaccines, the high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy represents a significant challenge to public health, and raising vaccine acceptance among the public is critical. Although media has become an increasingly popular source of COVID-19 vaccine-related information, the question of whether and how media use is related to the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants exploration.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, (2) identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (3) explore the direct and indirect relationship between media use and vaccine hesitancy through psychological factors.
   Methods: A month before COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in South Korea, we conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey over 6 days (January 20-25, 2021). This study included 1016 participants, and a logit model for regression analyzed associations between sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, psychological factors, and media use toward one's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, we conducted a path analysis to examine the indirect effects of media use on vaccine hesitancy by using psychological factors (ie, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of COVID-19 vaccination).
   Results: Among the participants (N=1016), 53.3% (541/1016) hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 46.7% (475/1016) agreed to accept the vaccine. Of the sociodemographic factors, female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.967, 95% CI 1.36-2.86; P<.001), age in 50s (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.96; P=.004), and age over 60s (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.99; P=.04) were significant individual predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Perceived susceptibility of infection (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) and perceived benefits of vaccination (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91; P=.01) were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Perceived barriers of vaccination (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.29-2.07; P<.001) and lower trust in government (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98; P=.04) were related to vaccine hesitancy. The use of offline and online media as sources for the perceived benefits of vaccination was associated with vaccine hesitancy, resulting in lower vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, perceived susceptibility of the disease and perceived barriers of vaccination mediated the association between social media use and vaccine hesitancy.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed a considerable level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in South Korea. Gender-based and generation-based public health policies and communication are recommended. Efforts to lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived benefits of the vaccine are required. Although the use of media has a positive and negative effect on the population's vaccine hesitancy, efforts should be made to disseminate reliable and timely information on media while confronting misinformation or disinformation for successive implementation of vaccine programs during pandemics.

TI  - Case report for an internet- and mobile-based intervention for internet use disorder
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and aims: Internet use disorder (IUD), characterized as the inability to control one's internet use, is associated with reduced quality of life and mental health comorbidities such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety. Evidence-based treatment options are scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address affected individuals in their online setting. This study presents a newly developed IMI for IUD disclosing treatment satisfaction and preliminary effects by exemplifying with a case report.
   Methods: The case of a female participant with IUD, characterized by an excessive use of social media, is analyzed. The case report follows the CARE guidelines and presents qualitative and quantitative outcomes regarding potential symptom reduction measured by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS), treatment satisfaction measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) and feasibility by analyzing participant's written feedback during treatment.
   Results: The case report shows that internet- and mobile-based interventions may be feasible in supporting an individual in reducing symptoms of IUD as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and procrastination behavior. Treatment satisfaction was reported as good.
   Discussion and conclusions: This case report illustrates that IMIs can have the potential to be an easily accessible and possibly effective treatment option for IUD. Case studies on IMIs may provide insights into important mechanisms for symptom change. Further studies are needed to expand our understanding of this diverse disorder to provide adequate treatment.

TI  - Text mining of veterinary forums for epidemiological surveillance supplementation
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB  - Web scraping and text mining are popular computer science methods deployed by public health researchers to augment traditional epidemiological surveillance. However, within veterinary disease surveillance, such techniques are still in the early stages of development and have not yet been fully utilised. This study presents an exploration into the utility of incorporating internet-based data to better understand smallholder farming communities within the UK, by using online text extraction and the subsequent mining of this data. Web scraping of the livestock fora was conducted, with text mining and topic modelling of data in search of common themes, words, and topics found within the text, in addition to temporal analysis through anomaly detection. Results revealed that some of the key areas in pig forum discussions included identification, age management, containment, and breeding and weaning practices. In discussions about poultry farming, a preference for free-range practices was expressed, along with a focus on feeding practices and addressing red mite infestations. Temporal topic modelling revealed an increase in conversations around pig containment and care, as well as poultry equipment maintenance. Moreover, anomaly detection was discovered to be particularly effective for tracking unusual spikes in forum activity, which may suggest new concerns or trends. Internet data can be a very effective tool in aiding traditional veterinary surveillance methods, but the requirement for human validation of said data is crucial. This opens avenues of research via the incorporation of other dynamic social media data, namely Twitter, in addition to location analysis to highlight spatial patterns.

TI  - Modeling influenza-like illnesses through composite compartmental models
T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - Epidemiological models for the spread of pathogens in a population are usually only able to describe a single pathogen. This makes their application unrealistic in cases where multiple pathogens with similar symptoms are spreading concurrently within the same population. Here we describe a method which makes possible the application of multiple single-strain models under minimal conditions. As such, our method provides a bridge between theoretical models of epidemiology and data-driven approaches for modeling of influenza and other similar viruses.
   Our model extends the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to higher dimensions, allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple viruses. We further provide a method, based on an overcomplete dictionary of feasible realizations of SIR solutions, to blindly partition the time series representing the number of infected people in a population into individual components, each representing the effect of a single pathogen.
   We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on five years of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, estimated from Twitter data. We demonstrate that our method describes, on average, 44% of the variance in the ILl time series. The individual infectious components derived from our model are matched to known viral profiles in the populations, which we demonstrate matches that of independently collected epidemiological data. We further show that the basic reproductive numbers (RO) of the matched components are in range known for these pathogens.
   Our results suggest that the proposed method can be applied to other pathogens and geographies, providing a simple method for estimating the parameters of epidemics in a population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incorporating Unstructured Patient Narratives and Health Insurance Claims Data in Pharmacovigilance: Natural Language Processing Analysis of Patient-Generated Texts About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Gaining insights that cannot be obtained from health care databases from patients has become an important topic in pharmacovigilance. Objective: Our objective was to demonstrate a use case, in which patient-generated data were incorporated in pharmacovigilance, to understand the epidemiology and burden of illness in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods: We used data on systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that substantially impairs quality of life, from 2 independent data sets. To understand the disease's epidemiology, we analyzed a Japanese health insurance claims database. To understand the disease's burden, we analyzed text data collected from Japanese disease blogs (tobyoki) written by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Natural language processing was applied to these texts to identify frequent patient-level complaints, and term frequency-inverse document frequency was used to explore patient burden during treatment. We explored health-related quality of life based on patient descriptions. Results: We analyzed data from 4694 and 635 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in the health insurance claims database and tobyoki blogs, respectively. Based on health insurance claims data, the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is 107.70 per 100,000 persons. Tobyoki text data analysis showed that pain-related words (eg, pain, severe pain, arthralgia) became more important after starting treatment. We also found an increase in patients' references to mobility and self-care over time, which indicated increased attention to physical disability due to disease progression. Conclusions: A classical medical database represents only a part of a patient's entire treatment experience, and analysis using solely such a database cannot represent patient-level symptoms or patient concerns about treatments. This study showed that analysis of tobyoki blogs can provide added information on patient-level details, advancing patient-centric pharmacovigilance.

TI  - Colonization and transmission of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in schools: a citizen science project
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
AB  - Aggregation of children in schools has been established to be a key driver of transmission of infectious diseases. Mathematical models of transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data. However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within two secondary schools in England and test for associations between self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates from the local community were also sequenced to assess the representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission, increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age children may be an important source of community transmission.

TI  - Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis of the Public Discourse on Twitter about COVID-19 and MPox
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
AB  - Mining and analysis of the big data of Twitter conversations have been of significant interest to the scientific community in the fields of healthcare, epidemiology, big data, data science, computer science, and their related areas, as can be seen from several works in the last few years that focused on sentiment analysis and other forms of text analysis of tweets related to Ebola, E-Coli, Dengue, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Measles, Zika virus, H1N1, influenza-like illness, swine flu, flu, Cholera, Listeriosis, cancer, Liver Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, kidney disease, lupus, Parkinson's, Diphtheria, and West Nile virus. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and MPox have served as "catalysts" for Twitter usage related to seeking and sharing information, views, opinions, and sentiments involving both of these viruses. None of the prior works in this field analyzed tweets focusing on both COVID-19 and MPox simultaneously. To address this research gap, a total of 61,862 tweets that focused on MPox and COVID-19 simultaneously, posted between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023, were studied. The findings and contributions of this study are manifold. First, the results of sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) approach shows that nearly half the tweets (46.88%) had a negative sentiment. It was followed by tweets that had a positive sentiment (31.97%) and tweets that had a neutral sentiment (21.14%), respectively. Second, this paper presents the top 50 hashtags used in these tweets. Third, it presents the top 100 most frequently used words in these tweets after performing tokenization, removal of stopwords, and word frequency analysis. The findings indicate that tweets in this context included a high level of interest regarding COVID-19, MPox and other viruses, President Biden, and Ukraine. Finally, a comprehensive comparative study that compares the contributions of this paper with 49 prior works in this field is presented to further uphold the relevance and novelty of this work.

TI  - <i>Escherichia coli</i> on the internet: The power of YouTube to educate and influence consumer behavior regarding pathogenic bacteria
T2  - INFECTION DISEASE & HEALTH
AB  - Background: Proper education about food safety and hand hygiene helps to reduce the risk of exposure to Escherichia coli associated disease. The purpose of this study was to describe the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos on the subject of E. coli to determine what consumers are viewing related to the hazards of, and reducing risk of exposure to, bacteria such as E. coli.
   Methods: The search term was conducted using the keywords "E. coli." The 100 videos with the top view counts were included in this study. The sampling frame for this study included only videos that were in English. The source of the upload of each video was determined to be one of the following: (1) consumer, (2) professional (MD, RN)/government, (3) any news (television-based, internet-based, or print/radio). Content categories were created using a fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Results: Videos uploaded by a news source tended to have been uploaded more recently (2015-2018) compared to other sources (p < 0.001). Videos uploaded by consumers or news sources tended to have more views than professional/government-uploaded videos (p=0.044). Videos uploaded by news sources were more likely to mention a specific outbreak (p < 0.001), statistics (p = 0.004), and transmission via raw meat (p = 0.036), feces (p = 0.006), vegetables or produce (p = 0.006), and processing techniques (p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: YouTube videos on the topic were widely divergent, and varied in content, emphasizing different aspects of concern over hazards associated with E. coli. Consumer sources, rather than experts, were the most common source of upload of the most highly viewed videos. Government agencies, which collect and analyze public health data, do not appear to use YouTube effectively to disseminate information. This underscores the need for media to work with government agencies to provide accurate, timely information to the public. (C) 2019 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control.

T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: To examine how recent sex work is identified and the HIV risk factors and service needs among Thai cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) who exchange sex.
   Methods: MSM and TGW in Bangkok and Pattaya who exchanged sex in the last year (n = 890) were recruited through social media, outreach, and word-of-mouth. Recent sex exchange was based on the primary question, "In the last 30 days, have you sold or traded sex"; secondary questions (regarding income source and client encounters) were also investigated.
   Results: Overall, 436 (48%) participants engaged in sex work in the last 30 days; among those, 270 (62%) reported exchanging sex by the primary question, and 160 (37%) based on secondary questions only. Recent sex exchange was associated with gonorrhea, syphilis, discussing PrEP with others, and using condoms, alcohol, methamphetamine, amyl nitrate, and Viagra. Exchanging sex based on secondary questions only was associated with being in a relationship, social media recruitment, less recent anal intercourse, and not discussing PrEP.
   Conclusions: Thai MSM and TGW who exchange sex need regular access to HIV/STI prevention, testing, and treatment services, and multiple approaches to assessing sex work will help identify and serve this diverse and dynamic population. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cross-sectional Study of Factors Associated With Suicide Ideation in Ontario Adolescents
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
AB  - Objective Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Canadian adolescents. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide attempts to explain suicide etiology and proposes that feelings of perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness lead to suicide ideation, but this has not been extensively studied in adolescents. This study aimed to use the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to examine factors that may be associated with suicide ideation in adolescents. The factors of interest were school connectedness, perceived availability of support, self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hopelessness, bullying and cyberbullying victimization, substance use, and social media use. Methods Data were from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a survey of 7th to 12th graders enrolled in a publicly funded school in Ontario. Weighted multivariate logistic regression of suicide ideation on all exposure variables was conducted. Results 13.6% of students in the sample endorsed having suicidal ideation in the preceding 12 months. Not knowing where to turn to for support, feeling worthless, endorsing low self-esteem, being bullied, and using cannabis were each associated with greater odds of suicide ideation. Feeling hopeless, social media use, using alcohol and tobacco, and being cyberbullied were not associated with suicide ideation in the weighted multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusions This study is consistent with the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness, two indicators of perceived burdensomeness, and not knowing where to turn to for support, an indicator of thwarted belongingness, were associated with greater odds of suicide ideation. These findings can help guide interventions aimed at reducing the burden of suicidality during adolescence and demonstrate the need to provide accessible mental health support for youth.

TI  - The Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI): Overview and methods
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - Background-Genetic factors contribute to anorexia nervosa (AN); and the first genome-wide significant locus has been identified. We describe methods and procedures for the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), an international collaboration designed to rapidly recruit 13,000 individuals with AN and ancestrally matched controls. We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research.
   Methods: ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H.
   Results: Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,363 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable.
   Conclusions: Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups. High online presence of individuals with AN rendered the Internet/social media a remarkably effective recruitment tool in some countries. ANGI has substantially augmented Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN sample collection.

TI  - Network analysis of cases with methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and controls in a large tertiary care facility
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: Despite increased awareness of infection control precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time.
   Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.
   Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study.

TI  - Collective Response to Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Reddit and Wikipedia: Mixed-Methods Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may alter people's risk perception and trigger behavioral changes, which can ultimately affect the evolution of the disease. It is thus of utmost importance to map the dissemination of information by mainstream media outlets and the public response to this information. However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic is still limited.
   Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize the media coverage and collective internet response to the COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada
   Methods: We collected a heterogeneous data set including 227,768 web-based news articles and 13,448 YouTube videos published by mainstream media outlets, 107,898 user posts and 3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views of COVID-19-related Wikipedia pages. To analyze the relationship between media coverage, epidemic progression, and users' collective web-based response, we considered a linear regression model that predicts the public response for each country given the amount of news exposure. We also applied topic modelling to the data set using nonnegative matrix factorization.
   Results: Our results show that public attention, quantified as user activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage; meanwhile, this activity declines rapidly while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, using an unsupervised, dynamic topic modeling approach, we show that while the levels of attention dedicated to different topics by media outlets and internet users are in good accordance, interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns.
   Conclusions: Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perception and response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on people's collective awareness and risk perception and thus on their tendencies toward behavioral change.

TI  - Impact of Communication Measures Implemented During a School Tuberculosis Outbreak on Risk Perception among Parents and School Staff, Italy, 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Risk perception has a significant impact on decisions people make when facing a threat: a mismatch between actual hazard and perceived risk can lead to inappropriate behaviours and suboptimal compliance to recommended public health measures. The present study was conducted in the aftermath of a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak that occurred in 2019 in a primary school in Italy. The aim was to evaluate the impact of communication measures implemented by local health authorities (including face-to-face meetings between LHAs and the local population, weekly press announcements, implementation of a telephone hotline and of an information desk, and social media communication), on risk perception among parents of schoolchildren and school staff, and to identify factors related to a change in risk perception before and after the said activities. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to parents of schoolchildren (n = 846) and to school staff (n = 70). Participants were asked about the level of risk they had perceived at two distinct times: when they first became aware of the outbreak and following implementation of communication activities. A significant reduction of perceived risk was found in both groups (p < 0.001) following the communication activities. The largest reduction was found among participants who reported having appreciated the meetings with the LHA healthcare staff. Our findings suggest that keeping an open approach, explaining the actual threat to the population and adapting communication to different listening skills, are essential for health authorities to successfully manage a public health emergency.

TI  - Knowledge level and factors influencing prevention of COVID-19 pandemic among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha City administrations, North-East Ethiopia: a population-based cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective
   In Ethiopia, community-level knowledge about the current COVID-19 pandemic has not been well studied. This study is aimed to assess knowledge level and factors influencing the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic among residents of Dessie and Kombolcha city administrations, Ethiopia.
   Design
   Community-based cross-sectional study.
   Settings
   Dessie and Kombolcha city administrations.
   Participants
   Participants were household heads or members (n=828, >18 years) who have lived in the study area for at least 2 months preceding the survey.
   Methods
   Binary logistic regression was used for a single outcome and multiple response variables. In the multivariable regression model, a value of p<0.05 and adjusted OR (AOR) with 95% CI were used to identify factors associated with knowledge level of the community. Epi Info V.7.2 and SPSS V.20 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively.
   Outcome
   Knowledge level.
   Results
   A total of 828 participants was involved with a response rate of 98%. Women were 61.7%. Participants' mean (+/- SD) age was 39 (+/- 14) years. Of the total participants 54.11% (95% CI 50.6% to 57.6%) had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 prevention. Significant associations were reported among women (AOR=1.41; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.92); age >= 65 years (AOR=2.72; 95% CI 1.45 to 5.11); rural residence (AOR=2.69; 95% CI 1.78 to 4.07); unable to read and write (AOR=1.60; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.51); information not heard from healthcare workers, mass media and social media (AOR=1.95; 95% CI 1.35 to 2.82), (AOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.58 to 4.19) and (AOR=2.13; 95% CI 1.33 to 3.42), respectively, with inadequate knowledge.
   Conclusion
   These findings revealed that more than 50% of participants had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19. It highlights the need for widespread awareness campaigns about COVID-19 through mass media, healthcare professionals and social media as sources of information. House-to-house awareness creation is recommended to address older adults who are more vulnerable to the pandemic.

TI  - Factors Associated With Lower Limb Injuries in Recreational Runners: A Cross-Sectional Survey Including Mental Aspects and Sleep Quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
AB  - Knowledge about prevalence and etiology of running-related injuries (RRIs) is important to design effective RRI prevention programs. Mental aspects and sleep quality seem to be important potential risk factors, yet their association with RRIs needs to be elucidated. The aims of this study are to investigate the epidemiology of RRIs in recreational runners and the association of mental aspects, sleep, and other potential factors with RRIs. An internet-based questionnaire was sent to recreational runners recruited through social media, asking for personal and training characteristics, mental aspects (obsessive passion, motivation to exercise), sleep quality, perceived health, quality of life, foot arch type, and RRIs over the past six months. Data were analyzed descriptively and using logistic regression. Self-reported data from 804 questionnaires were analyzed. Twenty-five potential risk factors for RRIs were investigated. 54% of runners reported at least one RRI. The knee was the most-affected location (45%), followed by the lower leg (19%). Patellofemoral pain syndrome was the most-reported injury (20%), followed by medial tibial stress syndrome (17%). Obsessive passionate attitude (odds ratio (OR):1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.18-1.54), motivation to exercise (OR:1.09; CI:1.03-1.15), and sleep quality (OR:1.23; CI:1.15-1.31) were associated with RRIs, as were perceived health (OR:0.96; CI:0.94-0.97), running over 20 km/week (OR:1.58; CI:1.04-2.42), overweight (OR:2.17; CI:1.41-3.34), pes planus (OR:1.80; CI:1.12-2.88), hard-surface running (OR:1.37; CI:1.17-1.59), running company (OR:1.65; CI:1.16-2.35), and following a training program (OR:1.51; CI:1.09-2.10). These factors together explained 30% of the variance in RRIs. A separate regression analysis showed that mental aspects and sleep quality explain 15% of the variance in RRIs. The association of mental aspects and sleep quality with RRIs adds new insights into the multifactorial etiology of RRIs. We therefore recommend that besides common risk factors for RRI, mental aspects and sleep be incorporated into the advice on prevention and management of RRIs.

TI  - Pig trade networks through live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.

TI  - Association Rules and Network Analysis for Exploring Comorbidity Patterns in Health Systems
T2  - CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL NETWORK RESEARCH: METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Social Network Analysis (ARS) - Challenges in Social Network Research
AB  - The presence of patients affected by different diseases at the same time is becoming a major health and societal issue. In clinical literature, this phenomenon is known as comorbidity, and it can be studied from the administrative databases of general practitioners' prescriptions based on diagnoses. In this contribution, we propose a two-step strategy for analyzing comorbidity patterns. In the first step, we investigate the prescription data with association rules extracted by a two-mode network (or bipartite graph) to find frequent itemsets that can be used to assist physicians in making diagnoses. In the second step, we derive a one-mode network of the diseases codes with association rules, and we perform the k-core partitioning algorithm to identify the most relevant and connected parts in the network corresponding to the most related pathologies.

TI  - Personal protective equipment in Covid-19: Evidence-based quality and analysis of YouTube videos after one year of pandemic
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: The correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the Covid-19 pandemic is mandatory to minimize the contagion risk. The current study aimed to evaluate quality information of YouTube videos on PPE use during the pandemic. Methods: Using Google Trend tool, the frequency of worldwide YouTube and Google searches for "donning and doffing" was examined. We queried YouTube with terms related to donning and doffing of PPE. Validated quality information assessment tools were used. Results: From the December 1, 2019 to the January 31, 2021, according to YouTube and Google searches, both peaks occurred in April 2020 (69.5% and 72.0%, respectively). Of all videos, 144 were eligible for the analyses. According to misinformation tool, 90 (62.5%) videos contained inaccuracies. The median DISCERN Section 1 ranged from 3 to 5. The median DISCERN Section 3 was 4. According to Global Quality Score, 8.3% (n = 12), 14.6% (n = 21), 22.9% (n = 33), 30.6% (n = 44) and 23.6% (n = 34) were classified as poor, partially poor, moderate, partially good and excellent quality videos, respectively. Conclusions: Nowadays, YouTube may be recommended as a reliable source of information. Nevertheless, a not negligible number of videos contained inaccuracies. Future authors should improve videos contents to provide more complete information. (c) 2021 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Study protocol: the OxWell school survey investigating social, emotional and behavioural factors associated with mental health and well-being
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Improving our understanding of the broad range of social, emotional and behavioural factors that contribute to mental health outcomes in adolescents will be greatly enhanced with diverse, representative population samples. We present a protocol for a repeated self-report survey assessing risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being in school pupils aged 8-18 years with different socioeconomic backgrounds in England. The survey will provide a comprehensive picture of mental health and associated risks at the community level to inform the development of primary and secondary prevention and treatment strategies in schools. Methods and analysis This protocol is for a large-scale online repeated self-report survey, representative of children and adolescents aged 8-18 years attending schools or further education colleges in participating counties in England. The survey consists of around 300 questions, including validated measures of mental health and well-being, risk and protective factors, and care-seeking behaviour and preferences. Additional questions each year vary to address current events and novel hypotheses, developed by the research team, collaborators and stakeholders. Primary analyses will investigate current and changing risk and protective factors, care-seeking behaviour and attitudes to allowing linkage of their sensitive data to other databases for research, and will compare measures of mental health to measures of well-being. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the University of Oxford Research Ethics Committee (Reference: R62366). Tailored data summaries will be provided to participating schools and stakeholders within 3 months of data collection. The main findings will be presented at scientific meetings, published in peer-reviewed journals and shared via digital and social media channels. At the end of the study, other researchers will be able to apply for access to anonymous data extracts.

TI  - Google Trends-based non-English language query data and epidemic diseases: a cross-sectional study of the popular search behaviour in Taiwan
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective This study developed a surveillance system suitable for monitoring epidemic outbreaks and assessing public opinion in non-English-speaking countries. We evaluated whether social media reflects social uneasiness and fear during epidemic outbreaks and natural catastrophes.
   Design Cross-sectional study.
   Setting Freely available epidemic data in Taiwan.
   Main outcome measure We used weekly epidemic incidence data obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and online search query data obtained from Google Trends between 4 October 2015 and 2 April 2016. To validate whether non-English query keywords were useful surveillance tools, we estimated the correlation between online query data and epidemic incidence in Taiwan.
   Results With our approach, we noted that keywords (sic)(sic) ('common cold'), (sic)(sic) ('fever') and (sic)(sic) ('cough') exhibited good to excellent correlation between Google Trends query data and influenza incidence (r=0.898, p < 0.001; r=0.773, p < 0.001; r=0.796, p < 0.001, respectively). They also displayed high correlation with influenza-like illness emergencies (r=0.900, p < 0.001; r=0.802, p < 0.001; r=0.886, p < 0.001, respectively) and outpatient visits (r=0.889, p < 0.001; r=0.791, p < 0.001; r=0.870, p<0.001, respectively). We noted that the query (sic)(sic)(sic) ('enterovirus') exhibited excellent correlation with the number of enterovirus-infected patients in emergency departments (r=0.914, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions These results suggested that Google Trends can be a good surveillance tool for epidemic outbreaks, even in Taiwan, the non-English-speaking country. Online search activity indicates that people are concerned about epidemic diseases, even if they do not visit hospitals. This prompted us to develop useful tools to monitor social media during an epidemic because such media usage reflects infectious disease trends more quickly than does traditional reporting.

TI  - Pedagogical Demonstration of Twitter Data Analysis: A Case Study of World AIDS Day, 2014
T2  - DATA
AB  - As a pedagogical demonstration of Twitter data analysis, a case study of HIV/AIDS-related tweets around World AIDS Day, 2014, was presented. This study examined if Twitter users from countries with various income levels responded differently to World AIDS Day. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models as classifiers of relevant tweets was evaluated. A manual coding of 1,826 randomly sampled HIV/AIDS-related original tweets from November 30 through December 2, 2014 was completed. Logistic regression was applied to analyze the association between the World Bank-designated income level of users' self-reported countries and Twitter contents. To identify the optimal SVM model, 1278 (70%) of the 1826 sampled tweets were randomly selected as the training set, and 548 (30%) served as the test set. Another 180 tweets were separately sampled and coded as the held-out dataset. Compared with tweets from low-income countries, tweets from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries had 60% lower odds to mention epidemiology (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.404; 95% CI: 0.166, 0.981) and three times the odds to mention compassion/support (aOR = 3.080; 95% CI: 1.179, 8.047). Tweets from lower-middle-income countries had 79% lower odds than tweets from low-income countries to mention HIV-affected sub-populations (aOR = 0.213; 95% CI: 0.068, 0.664). The optimal SVM model was able to identify relevant tweets from the held-out dataset of 180 tweets with an accuracy (F1 score) of 0.72. This study demonstrated how students can be taught to analyze Twitter data using manual coding, regression models, and SVM models.

TI  - Day-1 Competencies for Veterinarians Specific to Health Informatics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - In 2015, the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) developed the Competency-Based Veterinary Education (CBVE) framework to prepare practice-ready veterinarians through competency-based education, which is an outcomes-based approach to equipping students with the skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, and abilities to do their jobs. With increasing use of health informatics (HI: the use of information technology to deliver healthcare) by veterinarians, competencies in HI need to be developed. To reach consensus on a HI competency framework in this study, the Competency Framework Development (CFD) process was conducted using an online adaptation of Developing-A-Curriculum, an established methodology in veterinary medicine for reaching consensus among experts. The objectives of this study were to (1) create an HI competency framework for new veterinarians; (2) group the competency statements into common themes; (3) map the HI competency statements to the AAVMC competencies as illustrative sub-competencies; (4) provide insight into specific technologies that are currently relevant to new veterinary graduates; and (5) measure panelist satisfaction with the CFD process. The primary emphasis of the final HI competency framework was that veterinarians must be able to assess, select, and implement technology to optimize the client-patient experience, delivery of healthcare, and work-life balance for the veterinary team. Veterinarians must also continue their own education regarding technology by engaging relevant experts and opinion leaders.

TI  - Global Trends and Research Hotspots in Long COVID: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Long COVID is a condition distinguished by long-term sequelae that occur or persist after the convalescence period of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced long COVID, which attracted the attention of researchers. This study aims to assess the pattern of long COVID research literature, analyze the research topics, and provide insights on long COVID. In this study, we extracted 784 publications from Scopus in the field of long COVID. According to bibliometric analysis, it is found that: developed countries in Europe and America were in leading positions in terms of paper productivity and citations. The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health and the Journal of Clinical Medicine were leading journals in the perspective of publications count, and Nature Medicine had the highest number of citations. Author Greenhalgh T has the highest number of papers and citations. The main research topics were: pathophysiology, symptoms, treatment, and epidemiology. The causes of long COVID may be related to organ injury, inflammation, maladaptation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway, and mental factors. The symptoms are varied, including physical and psychological symptoms. Treatment options vary from person to person. Most patients developed at least one long-term symptom. Finally, we presented some possible research opportunities.

TI  - Role of social capital in response to and recovery from the first wave of COVID-19 in Thailand: a qualitative study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - ObjectiveThis study assesses the role of social capital among people and communities in response to the first wave of the pandemic in 2020.DesignQualitative study using focus group discussions.SettingCapital city (Bangkok) and the four regions (north, northeast, south and central) of Thailand.Participants161 participants of 19 focus groups with diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, profession, education and geography (urban/rural; regions). They are selected for different levels of impact from the pandemic.FindingsThe solidarity among the Thai people was a key contributing factor to societal resilience during the pandemic. Findings illustrate how three levels of social capital structure-family, community and local networks-mobilised resources from internal and external social networks to support people affected by the pandemic. The results also highlight different types of resources mobilised from the three levels of social capital, factors that affect resilience, collective action to combat the negative impacts of the pandemic, and the roles of social media and gender.ConclusionSocial capital plays significant roles in the resilience of individuals, households and communities to respond to and recover from the impacts of the pandemic. In many instances, social capital is a faster and more efficient response than other kinds of formal support. Social capital can be enhanced by interactions and exchanges in the communities. While face-to-face social contacts are challenged by the need for social distancing and travel restrictions, social media steps in as alternative socialisation to enhance social capital.

TI  - Establishing breast feeding in infants with Down syndrome: the FADES cohort experience
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
AB  - Objective To describe breastfeeding prevalence and maternal experience in infants with trisomy 21. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting Participants from UK recruited through websites, social media and local collaborators: neonatologists, community paediatricians and research nurses. Subjects Infants under the age of 8 months with Down syndrome (DS) recruited to the Feeding and Autoimmunity in Down Syndrome Evaluation Study between 1 September 2014 and 31 August 2017. Seventy participants: median age 20 weeks (IQR 13-29 weeks) at initial questionnaire. Main outcome measure Breastfeeding prevalence at 6 weeks and 6 months among infants with DS. Results The prevalence of exclusive breast feeding among study participants was similar to the general population (13/61, 21% vs 23% at 6 weeks, 2/54, 4% vs 1% at 6 months). However, the prevalence of breast feeding (exclusive or combination feeding) among the study participants was higher than the general population (39/61 64% vs 55% at 6 weeks, 32/59 54% vs 34% at 6 months). Conclusion Although there may be challenges in establishing breast feeding in infants with DS, our data suggest that exclusive breast feeding is possible for some, and the prevalence of breast feeding is comparable to the prevalence in the general population.

This study aims to investigate the field of diabetes and obesity and related tweets in the context of health and disease. The database extracted using academic APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allowed the study to be run with content analysis and sentiment analysis techniques. These two analysis techniques are some of the tools of choice for the intended objectives. Content analysis facilitated the representation of a concept and a connection between two or more concepts, such as diabetes and obesity, on a purely text-based social platform such as Twitter. Sentiment analysis therefore allowed us to explore the emotional aspect related to the collected data related to the representation of such concepts. The results show a variety of representations connected to the two concepts and their correlations. From them it was possible to produce some clusters of elementary contexts and structure narrative and representational dimensions of the investigated concepts. The use of sentiment analysis and content analysis and cluster output to represent complex contexts such as diabetes and obesity for a social media community could increase knowledge of how virtual platforms impact fragile categories, facilitating concrete spillovers into public health strategies.

TI  - Challenges for medical libraries in times of COVID-19: Making clinical decisions that uphold research quality
T2  - EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION
AB  - Distance working in the context of the COVID-19 crisis has engendered a new model of collaborative activity for the Library of Donostialdea Integrated Health Organisation (San Sebastian, Spain). Promoted by the Clinical Epidemiology and Research Unit, this initiative has enabled Hospital Management to respond to some of the gaps in information revealed during the pandemic. Changes in editorial policies offering open access information, the lack of peer-reviewed literature, and the spread of scientific literature through social media are some of the factors that stand out in the search for the best evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Beyond self-tracking: Exploring and unpacking four emerging labels of patient data work
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - Despite the growing attention of researchers, healthcare managers and policy makers, data gathering and information management practices are largely untheorized areas. In this work are presented and discussed some early-stage conceptualizations: patient-generated health data, observations of daily living, quantified self and personal health information management. As I shall try to demonstrate, these labels are not neutral; rather, they underpin quite different perspectives with respect to health, patient-doctor relationship and the status of data.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19: A Text Mining Analysis of Twitter Data in Spanish Language
T2  - HISPANIC HEALTH CARE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Latino communities in the United States and Latin America are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed information shared on Twitter in Spanish language for insights into the public's communication and information needs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a mixed-methods analysis using a text mining approach. We used SAS Text Miner, an algorithmic-driven statistical program to capture 10,000 tweets posted between June 3, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We used the following search terms to capture relevant Twitter messages in Spanish language: "coronavirus," "covid-19," "corona," and the hash tags "#COVID19" and "#Coronavirus." Key text topics were identified and categorized into themes using an emergent content analysis. Results: We identified 12 text topics and six themes: (1) prevention measures, (2) epidemiology/surveillance, (3) economic impact, (4) optimizing nursing workforce, (5) access to reliable information, and (6) call for a response from the local government. Top trending hashtags from our search included #COVID19 (n = 7,098), #Coronavirus (n = 6,394), and #SNTESALUD (n = 2,598). Conclusions: Spanish-language Tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic contained information from health departments and labor unions on the surveillance, prevention, and impact of COVID-19. Public health officials should consider increasing their use of Twitter to ensure a wide dissemination of messages about COVID-19 in Spanish outlets.

TI  - FIVE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG WITH MEDIA VIOLENCE RESEARCH
T2  - THEORIZING CRIMINALITY AND POLICING IN THE DIGITAL MEDIA AGE
AB  - Purpose: Media violence theorists made five methodological errors, which have muddled theory construction. As such, the validity of the claim that media-violence must share blame for a rise in aggression in society is suspect.
   Approach: Here, the authors explain those five errors: (1) Subclinical psychopathologies interact with media messages in detectable ways. Media violence researchers never paid attention to the composition of their participant samples. Consequently, they were never aware of the inherent vulnerabilities, or immunities, to media violence of their participants. (2) Media violence researchers used convenience samples when they should have used random samples to study media violence. The nature of the research questions they were asking required the use of random samples. But, with the use of convenience samples, those samples never matched the populations they were designed to examine. (3) Media violence researchers used expansive variable lists that probably triggered family-wise interaction effects, thus reporting interactions between independent and dependent variables that were meaningless. (4) Most media violence data are correlational. So, researchers used converged data from correlational studies to infer causation. But their convergence procedures were improperly executed, which led to incorrect interpretations. (5) Media violence researchers, from the outset of their work in the 1980s, pathologized media violence first, then set about trying to find out how it presumably harmed society. Those researchers should have considered the idea that media violence is nothing more than mere entertainment for most people.
   Value: In addition to questioning the claims made by media violence researchers, these five errors serve as a cautionary tale to social media researchers. Scholars investigating the effects of social media use might consider the possibility that social media are nothing more than new modes of communication.

TI  - Network analysis of frailty and aging: Empirical data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Background: Frailty remains a challenge in the aging research area with a number of gaps in knowledge still to be filled. Frailty seems to behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter. Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was the main purpose of our study.
   Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012, mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning, and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms, hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and tertiles of the total FI score.
   Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8% were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how the nodes are connected changed.
   Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network. Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of frailty in older adults.

TI  - Nairobi Early Childcare in Slums (NECS) Study Protocol: a mixed-methods exploration of paid early childcare in Mukuru slum, Nairobi
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
AB  - IntroductionThe early years are critical. Early nurturing care can lay the foundation for human capital accumulation with lifelong benefits. Conversely, early adversity undermines brain development, learning and future earning.Slums are among the most challenging places to spend those early years and are difficult places to care for a child. Shifting family and work structures mean that paid, largely informal, childcare seems to be becoming the 'new normal' for many preschool children growing up in rapidly urbanising Africa. However, little is known about the quality of this childcare.AimsTo build a rigorous understanding what childcare strategies are used and why in a typical Nairobi slum, with a particular focus on provision and quality of paid childcare. Through this, to inform evaluation of quality and design and implementation of interventions with the potential to reach some of the most vulnerable children at the most critical time in the life course.Methods and analysisMixed methods will be employed. Qualitative research (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) with parents/carers will explore need for and decision-making about childcare. A household survey (of 480 households) will estimate the use of different childcare strategies by parents/carers and associated parent/carer characteristics. Subsequently, childcare providers will be mapped and surveyed to document and assess quality of current paid childcare. Semistructured observations will augment self-reported quality with observable characteristics/practices. Finally, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with childcare providers will explore their behaviours and motivations. Qualitative data will be analysed through thematic analysis and triangulation across methods. Quantitative and spatial data will be analysed through epidemiological methods (random effects regression modelling and spatial statistics).Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been granted in the UK and Kenya. Findings will be disseminated through journal publications, community and government stakeholder workshops, policy briefs and social media content.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship Between Usage and Outcomes of an eHealth Cardiac Rehabilitation Intervention Subanalysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING
AB  - This study aimed to explore the relationship between patients' characteristics and eHealth cardiac rehabilitation adherence and between eHealth usage metrics and behavior change. A subanalysis of 73 patients in the intervention group who received eHealth cardiac rehabilitation was conducted. Usage metrics on the number of Web site logins, health data uploads, and times of peer interaction and professional consultation were captured. Linear regression analysis was used. Participants (n = 73) were predominantly male with an average age of 55.53 (SD, 7.3) years. Younger age, having been treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, and hypertension predict higher Web site logins, whereas higher education, comorbidity with hypertension and diabetes, larger family size, and having been treated with percutaneous coronary intervention predict higher chatroom engagement. The Web site logins, Web site data uploads, chatroom nurse consultation, age, number of family members, drinking, and coresidency status were identified as significant correlates and explained 41.8% of the improvement in behavior change. This study demonstrated empirical evidence that Web site visits, health data uploads, and nurse consultations are crucial for behavior modification. Further studies may monitor usage metrics and investigate self-reported usage to explore the role of peer interaction in modifying behavior.

TI  - Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS): protocol for an observational case-control study focusing on the patient interval in ovarian cancer diagnosis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women worldwide, and about 1 in 5 women with ovarian cancer do not receive treatment, because they are too unwell by the time they are diagnosed. Symptoms of ovarian cancer are non-specific or can be associated with other common conditions, and women experiencing these symptoms have been shown to self-manage them using over-the-counter medication. Results from a recent proof-of-concept study suggest there may be an increase in the purchases of painkillers and indigestion medication 10-12 months before ovarian cancer diagnosis. We propose a case-control study, as part of a larger project called the Cancer Loyalty Card Study (CLOCS), to investigate whether a significant change in medication purchases could be an indication for early signs of ovarian cancer, using data already collected through store loyalty cards.
   Methods and analysis Using a retrospective case-control design, we aim to recruit 500 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer (cases) and 500 women without ovarian cancer (controls) in the UK who hold a loyalty card with at least one participating high street retailer. We will use pre-existing loyalty card data to compare past purchase patterns of cases with those of controls. In order to assess ovarian cancer risk in participants and their purchase patterns, we will collect information from participants on ovarian cancer risk factors and clinical data including symptoms experienced before diagnosis from recruited women with ovarian cancer.
   Ethics and dissemination CLOCS was reviewed and approved by the North West-Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee (19/NW/0427). Study outcomes will be disseminated through academic publications, the study website, social media and a report to the research sites that support the study once results are published.

T2  - 2018 IEEE/WIC/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB INTELLIGENCE (WI 2018)
CP  - IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)
AB  - In this ongoing work, we present the Grebe social data aggregation framework for extracting geo-fenced Twitter data for analysis of user engagement in health and wellness topics. Grebe also provides various visualization tools for analyzing temporal and geographical health trends. Grebe currently has over 18 million indexed public tweets, and is the first of its kind for Canadian researchers. The large dataset is used for analyzing three types of contexts: geographical context via prediction of user location using supervised learning, topical context via determining health-related tweets using various learning approaches, and affective context via sentiment analysis of tweets using rule-based methods. For the first, we define user location as the position from which users are posting a tweet and use standard precision metrics for evaluation with promising results for predicting provinces and cities from tweet text. For the second, we use a broader definition of health using the six dimensions of wellness model and evaluate using manually annotated documents with good results using supervised and semi-supervised machine learning. For the third, we use the indexed tweets to show current trends in emotions and opinions and demonstrate trends in polarity and emotions across various Canadian provinces. The combination of these contexts provides useful insights for digital epidemiology. Ultimately, the vision of Grebe is to provide researchers with Canada-specific social web datasets through an open source platform with an accessible RESTful API, and this paper showcases Grebe's potential and presents our progress towards achieving these goals.

TI  - Protocol for the development of a reporting guideline for causal and counterfactual prediction models in biomedicine
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction While there are guidelines for reporting on observational studies (eg, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data Statement), estimation of causal effects from both observational data and randomised experiments (eg, A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses of Randomised Trials and Observational Studies, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, PATH) and on prediction modelling (eg, Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis), none is purposely made for deriving and validating models from observational data to predict counterfactuals for individuals on one or more possible interventions, on the basis of given (or inferred) causal structures. This paper describes methods and processes that will be used to develop a Reporting Guideline for Causal and Counterfactual Prediction Models (PRECOG). Methods and analysis PRECOG will be developed following published guidance from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) network and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will be meetings of a working group every other week with rotating external advisors (active until stage 5). Stage 2 will comprise a systematic review of literature on counterfactual prediction modelling for biomedical sciences (registered in Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). In stage 3, a computer-based, real-time Delphi survey will be performed to consolidate the PRECOG checklist, involving experts in causal inference, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, informatics and protocols/standards. Stage 4 will involve the write-up of the PRECOG guideline based on the results from the prior stages. Stage 5 will seek the peer-reviewed publication of the guideline, the scoping/systematic review and dissemination. Ethics and dissemination The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study has been registered in EQUATOR and approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Review Board (#202200495). Informed consent will be obtained from the working groups and the Delphi survey participants. The dissemination of PRECOG and its products will be done through journal publications, conferences, websites and social media.

TI  - Current Trend of Virology in the Post COVID-19 Era with Related Topic-Based Tweet Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - In light of current trends in virology, we performed social media analysis of 13 main topics in the area of virology and ranked these topics with metrics such as users, posts, engagement, and influence. These metrics were monitored against the 13 keywords on Twitter for the same period (i.e., from 27 November to 6 December 2021) for benchmarking purposes. The 13 main topics were "virological Science", " preventive vaccines", "therapeutic vaccines", "viral pathogenesis", "viral immunology", "antiviral strategies", "virus structure", "virus expression", "viral resistance", "emerging viruses", "interspecies transmission", "viruses and cancer" and " viral diseases". "viral diseases" recorded the highest number of users (i.e., 905 users) and the highest number of post (i.e., about 1K posts). The second-highest number of posts were monitored to be on "therapeutic vaccines" with 729 posts from 691 users. In terms of engagement, "viral diseases" (3.4 K) were found to be on the top followed by "viruses and cancer" (3.1K). Lastly, in terms of influence, "viral diseases" recorded 9.0 million influences followed by 6.6 million influences on "emerging viruses". In summary, "viral diseases" was found to be the most engaging and influential topic highest with the highest number of posts from most of the tweet users. In relation to trending hashtags in virology, #COVID19 recorded the highest number of hashtags, followed by # omicron, #sarscov2, #publichealth, #omicronvarient, #wuhan, #originofcovid, #fauci and #epidemiology. Word clouds showing the main area of discussion were also generated for these 13 main topics.

TI  - Changes in intimate partner violence during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA
T2  - INJURY PREVENTION
AB  - The objective of this study is to describe intimate partner violence (IPV) severity and types of victimization during the early states of the COVID19 pandemic. A survey was distributed through social media and email distribution lists. The survey was open for 14 days in April 2020 and 2441 participated. Information on IPV, COVID19-related IPV severity, sociodemographics, and COVID19-related behaviors (eg, job loss) were collected. Regression models were used to evaluate COVID19-related IPV severity across victimization types and sociodemographics. 18% screened positive for IPV. Among the respondents that screened positive, 54% stated the victimization remained the same since the COVID19 outbreak, while 17% stated it worsened and 30% stated it got better. The odds of worsening victimization during the pandemic was significantly higher among physical and sexual violence. While the majority of IPV participants reported victimization to remain the same, sexual and physical violence was exacerbated during the early stages of the pandemic. Addressing victimization during the pandemic (and beyond) must be multi-sectorial.

AB  - We study the problems of finding a subset of nodes having a given size k and satisfying one of the following separation properties: The set is disconnected from the rest of the graph by a small/large cut or by a small separator. The considered problems are of interest in several practical settings, such as epidemiology or disaster control as well as to contrast viruses, malware, or misinformation propagate quickly in online social networks. All the considered problems are known to be NP-hard. Being computation time for very large networks is an important issue, we consider some parameters of the input graph G and show that the problems become tractable for small values of such parameters. Namely, we show that they become tractable when parameterized either by the neighborhood diversity or by the treewidth of G. We also consider the complexity of the problems when parameterized by the clique-width cw of G and show that they all can be solved in O(n(f(cw))), where n is the number of nodes in G. We also show that there is no f(cw)n(o(cw))-time algorithm for the graph cut problems (unless ETH fails).

TI  - Studying Cannabis Use Behaviors With Facebook and Web Surveys: Methods and Insights
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - The rapid and wide-reaching expansion of internet access and digital technologies offers epidemiologists numerous opportunities to study health behaviors. One particularly promising new data collection strategy is the use of Facebook's advertising platform in conjunction with Web-based surveys. Our research team at the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health has used this quick and cost-efficient method to recruit large samples and address unique scientific questions related to cannabis use. In conducting this research, we have gleaned several insights for using this sampling method effectively and have begun to document the characteristics of the resulting data. We believe this information could be useful to other researchers attempting to study cannabis use or, potentially, other health behaviors. The first aim of this paper is to describe case examples of procedures for using Facebook as a survey sampling method for studying cannabis use. We then present several distinctive features of the data produced using this method. Finally, we discuss the utility of this sampling method for addressing specific types of epidemiological research questions. Overall, we believe that sampling with Facebook advertisements and Web surveys is best conceptualized as a targeted, nonprobability-based method for oversampling cannabis users across the United States.

TI  - Stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers facing COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt: a cross-sectional online-based study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective
   This study assessed perceived stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt.
   Setting
   This was an online study where a Google form was prepared including sociodemographic and occupational data as well as three validated questionnaires to assess perceived stress, anxiety and depression, respectively. The form was distributed online to all social media groups including healthcare workers all across the country, and responses were collected until the sample size of 262.
   Participants
   Healthcare workers (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, nurses, technicians and administrators) working in governmental or educational hospitals from all Egyptian governorates who are members of social media groups. The mean age of participants was 33.4 +/- 5.9 years, 70% were women, about 70% were married and 66% were physicians.
   Outcomes
   The frequency of perceived stress, anxiety and depression observed among the study participants according to the results of their questionnaires. Then the frequencies were compared between different sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results
   Only 1.3% showed low perceived stress while 98.5% showed moderate to severe stress. About 9.5% did not experience generalised anxiety, while the remaining 90.5% had different degrees of anxiety as mild anxiety showed the highest per cent affecting about 40% of participants followed by moderate anxiety about 32% then severe anxiety, 18.5%. With regard to depression, 94% of participants showed mild to severe depression.
   Conclusion
   This study showed a high prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic that affected all workers regardless of different sociodemographic characteristics.

TI  - Injuries and Use of Safety Equipment in River Surfing
T2  - ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Background:River surfing (also called "rapid surfing") involves surfing on stationary waves that are artificially created or placed in rivers and is gaining popularity, especially among surfers in landlocked areas but also among athletes without experience in ocean surfing. Different wave setups, types of boards, and types of fins, as well as the use of safety equipment, can lead to overuse and injuries. Purpose:To analyze the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors of river surfing-related injuries for different types of waves and to evaluate the usage and appropriateness of safety equipment. Study Design:Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:An online survey was distributed via social media to river surfers in German-speaking countries to collect information on demographics, injury history for the previous 12 months, wave site attended, use of (safety) equipment, and health issues. The survey was accessible between November 2021 and February 2022. Results:A total of 213 participants completed the survey: 195 participants from Germany, 10 from Austria, 6 from Switzerland, and 2 from other countries. The mean age was 36 years (range, 11-73 years), 72% (n = 153) were male, and 10% (n = 22) took part in competitions. Overall, 60% (n = 128) of surfers experienced 741 surfing-related injuries over the previous 12 months. The most common mechanisms of injury were contact with the bottom of the pool/river (n = 75 [35%]), with the board (n = 65 [30%]), and with the fins (n = 57 [27%]). The most frequent injury types were contusions/bruises (n = 256), cuts/lacerations (n = 159), abrasions (n = 152), and overuse (n = 58). Injuries affected mainly the feet/toes (n = 90), head/face (n = 67), hand/fingers (n = 51), knee (n = 49), lower back (n = 49), and thighs (n = 45). Earplugs were used by 50 (24%) participants, and a helmet was used regularly by 38 (18%) participants and never by 175 (82%) participants. Conclusion:The most frequent types of injury in river surfers were contusions/bruises, cuts/lacerations, and abrasions. The main mechanisms of injury were contact with the bottom of the pool/river, with the board, or with the fins. The feet/toes were more prone to injuries, followed by the head/face and hand/fingers.

TI  - Not all screen time is created equal: associations with mental health vary by activity and gender
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Previous research on associations between screen media use and mental health produced mixed findings, possibly because studies have not examined screen activities separately or accounted for gender differences. We sought to examine associations between different types of screen activities (social media, internet, gaming, and TV) and mental health indicators separately for boys and girls. Methods We drew from a nationally representative sample of 13-15-year-old adolescents in the UK (n = 11,427) asking about hours per day spent on specific screen media activities and four mental health indicators: self-harm behavior, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. Results Hours spent on social media and Internet use were more strongly associated with self-harm behaviors, depressive symptoms, low life satisfaction, and low self-esteem than hours spent on electronic gaming and TV watching. Girls generally demonstrated stronger associations between screen media time and mental health indicators than boys (e.g., heavy Internet users were 166% more likely to have clinically relevant levels of depressive symptoms than low users among girls, compared to 75% more likely among boys). Conclusion Thus, not all screen time is created equal; social media and Internet use among adolescent girls are the most strongly associated with compromised mental health. Future research should examine different screen media activities and boys and girls separately where possible. Practitioners should be aware that some types of screen time are more likely to be linked to mental health issues than others.

TI  - The anatomy of COVID-19 comorbidity networks among hospitalized Korean patients
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine how comorbidities were associated with outcomes (illness severity or death) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   METHODS: Data were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen treatment not needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or death.
   RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52) were significantly associated with disease severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.00 to 14.31), heart failure (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15), malignancy (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.45 to 4.72), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49) were associated with an increased risk of death. Asthma and hypertension showed statistically insignificant associations with an increased risk of death.
   CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases contribute differently to the severity of COVID-19. To efficiently allocate limited medical resources, underlying comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly CKD, COPD, and HF.

TI  - CECM: A cognitive emotional contagion model in social networks
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Social networks have changed the way how people communicate with each other dramatically. The study on information dissemination in social networks has attracted considerable attention. Many evidences show that emotionsof netizens are likely to spread with information and the emotional contagion also affect information dissemination in social networks. In this paper, we propose a cognitive emotional contagion model (CECM) which combines the model of individual characteristics, the topology of a social network, and the changing process as well as evolution of emotion contagion. Distinguished from conventional epidemiology-based models, our CECM model not only considers the changes of individuals' emotional statuses but also the influence of individuals to others during the information dissemination in a social network. Specifically, CECM first models an individual's emotions as emotional attributes and emotional statuses. Using Emotional statuses, we define the process of an individual's emotional change, which could be affected by one's emotional attributes (e.g. personality). CECM also models the network-wise features of an individual, including one's authority and the connection strength to one's neighbors in a social network. Finally, given emotional models and network-wise features of all users in a social network, a series of transition probabilities among the user's emotional status are defined to model the emotional evolution. A series of simulations is conducted to observe the characteristics of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reflect the real-world situation of emotional contagion for different distributions of personality factors.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of the theme trends and knowledge structures of pulmonary embolism from 2017 to 2021
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundPulmonary embolism (PE) is a popular area of research in the field of respiratory medicine. We performed a bibliometric analysis based on PubMed database to characterize the distribution pattern of literature and knowledge structures related to PE. MethodsLiterature pertaining to PE from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, was retrieved from the PubMed database. Bibliographic information was generated using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder (BICOMB). The visualization matrix was established using gCLUTO software. Strategic diagram analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Social network analysis (SNA) was generated using Ucinet6.0 and NetDraw 2.084 software. ResultsOut of all the retrieved MeSH terms and subheadings, 52 MeSH terms/MeSH subheadings with a high frequency were found, and hot subjects were sorted into 6 clusters. The strategy diagram showed that the epidemiology, etiology, and drug therapy of PE were well advanced. In contrast, studies on diagnostic imaging, pathology, and complications of PE were still immature and offered potential research space. Social network analysis showed that marginal topics such as surgical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, prevention and control of postoperative complications, and metabolism and analysis of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were emerging research hotspots. ConclusionObjective analysis of the research developments in the field of PE can provide intuitive knowledge structure for researchers and clinicians. Analysis of the research hotspots related to PE is helpful for researchers and clinicians by highlighting future research directions.

TI  - A multi-species repository of social networks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB  - Social network analysis is an invaluable tool to understand the patterns, evolution, and consequences of sociality. Comparative studies over a range of social systems across multiple taxonomic groups are particularly valuable. Such studies however require quantitative social association or interaction data across multiple species which is not easily available. We introduce the Animal Social Network Repository (ASNR) as the first multi-taxonomic repository that collates 790 social networks from more than 45 species, including those of mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, and insects. The repository was created by consolidating social network datasets from the literature on wild and captive animals into a consistent and easy-to-use network data format. The repository is archived at https://bansallab.github.io/asnr/. ASNR has tremendous research potential, including testing hypotheses in the fields of animal ecology, social behavior, epidemiology and evolutionary biology.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'20)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - Geographical propagation phenomena occur in multiple domains, such as in epidemiology and social media. Propagation dynamics are often complex, and visualizations play a key role in helping subject-matter experts understand and analyze them. However, there is little empirical data about the effectiveness of the various strategies used to visualize geographical propagation. To fill this gap, we conduct an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies: an animated map, small-multiple maps, and a single map with glyphs. We compare them under five tasks that vary in one of the following dimensions: propagation scope, direction, speed, peaks, and spatial jumps. Our results show that small-multiple maps perform best overall, but that the effectiveness of each visualization varies depending on the task considered.

TI  - Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk of bias tool (PROBAST-AI) for diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies based on artificial intelligence
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford on 10-December-2020 (R73034/RE001). Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-review publications. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019140361 and CRD42019161764.

TI  - COVID-19: Nothing is Normal in this Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - This manuscript brings attention to inaccurate epidemiological concepts that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. In social media and scientific journals, some wrong references were given to a "normal epidemic curve" and also to a "log-normal curve/distribution". For many years, textbooks and courses of reputable institutions and scientific journals have disseminated misleading concepts. For example, calling histogram to plots of epidemic curves or using epidemic data to introduce the concept of a Gaussian distribution, ignoring its temporal indexing. Although an epidemic curve may look like a Gaussian curve and be eventually modelled by a Gauss function, it is not a normal distribution or a log-normal, as some authors claim. A pandemic produces highly-complex data and to tackle it effectively statistical and mathematical modelling need to go beyond the "onesize-fits-all solution". Classical textbooks need to be updated since pandemics happen and epidemiology needs to provide reliable information to policy recommendations and actions. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Integration of Rehabilitation Activities Into Everyday Life Through Telerehabilitation: Qualitative Study of Cardiac Patients and Their Partners
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Implementation of cardiac rehabilitation has not been optimal, with patient participation rates below 50%. Factors that contribute to cardiac patients' lack of participation in rehabilitation programs are patient motivation, logistical difficulties in getting to the rehabilitation facilities, lack of psychosocial elements, and individualization of activities in the rehabilitation programs. Telerehabilitation has been proposed as a new way to address the challenge of engaging and motivating cardiac patients and their partners to participate in rehabilitation.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of cardiac patients and their partners of participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program (TTP). The Teledialog program consisted of a digital rehabilitation plan, transmission of health data from patient's home to hospital and health care center, and an interactive Web portal with information and training videos.
   Methods: This case study used a theoretical approach combining the "community of practice" approach and self-determination theory. A triangulation of data collection techniques was used, including documents, participant observation (72 hours), and qualitative interviews with cardiac patients and their partners enrolled in the telerehabilitation group. A total of 14 cardiac patients, 12 patient spouses/partners, and 1 son participated in the study. The participants were interviewed at enrollment in the telerehabilitation program and after 12 weeks of participation in the program. Interview data were analyzed using NVivo 11.0.
   Results: Patients and their partners found the Web portal ActiveHeart.dk and the electronic rehabilitation (e-rehabilitation) plan to be helpful tools for health education, coordinating rehabilitation goals, creating an overview of the data, and ensuring continuity in the rehabilitation process. The patients felt that the TTP treated them as individuals, gave them a sense of autonomy, and provided enhanced relatedness to health care professionals and partners and a sense of competence as active participants in their own rehabilitation process. Some patients missed being part of a community of practice with other cardiac patients and did not use the Web forum. Patients' partners found that the telerehabilitation program gave them a sense of security and helped them balance their involvement as a partner to the patient and not push the patient too hard.
   Conclusions: Cardiac patients and their partners found telerehabilitation technologies a useful digital toolbox in the rehabilitation process. Telerehabilitation motivated the patients to integrate rehabilitation activities into their work schedule and everyday life and made them feel like unique individuals. Participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program might not be a suitable strategy for all cardiac patients. Being a patient's partner in the telerehabilitation program was associated with a heightened sense of security, navigation between active involvement in the rehabilitation process, being an equal partner, and not pushing the patient too hard.

TI  - Toward Using Twitter for Tracking COVID-19: A Natural Language Processing Pipeline and Exploratory Data Set
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In the United States, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the shortage of available testing, and the delay of test results present challenges for actively monitoring its spread based on testing alone.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to develop, evaluate, and deploy an automatic natural language processing pipeline to collect user-generated Twitter data as a complementary resource for identifying potential cases of COVID-19 in the United States that are not based on testing and, thus, may not have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Methods: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out "reported speech" (eg, quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between March 1 and August 21, 2020.
   Results: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644 (41%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen kappa). A deep neural network classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related to COVID-19, achieved an F-1-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76) for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19. Upon deploying our automatic pipeline, we identified 13,714 tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 and have US state-level geolocations.
   Conclusions: We have made the 13,714 tweets identified in this study, along with each tweet's time stamp and US state-level geolocation, publicly available to download. This data set presents the opportunity for future work to assess the utility of Twitter data as a complementary resource for tracking the spread of COVID-19.

TI  - From the individual to the collective: The emergence of a psychological approach to collective memory
T2  - APPLIED COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Throughout much of the 20th century, psychologists have largely examined mnemonic processes through an individualistic lens at the expense of social influences. However, this perspective began to change toward the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, when psychologists began to better appreciate the social nature of remembering. In the present paper, we focus on a relatively recent and important evolution of this line of research: the emergence of a psychological approach to collective memory. Using an epidemiological approach to collective memory, we attempt to distil the extant and relevant psychological research and focus on how (collective) memories transmit, converge, and remain stable over time while considering the bidirectional relationship between collective memory and a mnemonic community's identity. We conclude with a discussion of research areas that psychologists should examine moving forward, which will ultimately provide a more holistic understanding of how collective memories emerge, remain stable, and/or change over time.

TI  - Cohort protocol: Guangzhou High-Risk Infant Cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Despite the increase in the survival rate of high-risk infants (HRIs) worldwide, the prevalence of motor and neurodevelopmental sequelae in such newborns has not shown concomitant improvement. Meanwhile, there are few cohorts that explore factors related to the development of HRIs in China. Therefore, the Guangzhou High-Risk Infant Cohort (GHRIC) has been designed to examine the complex relationships among a myriad of factors influencing growth and development in such children. Methods and analysis The GHRIC study is a prospective cohort study that by the year 2023 will enrol an estimated total of 3000 HRIs from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (GWCMC) in Guangzhou, China. This study is designed to assess the growth and cognitive characteristics of HRIs and the risk factors affecting their development and prognoses. Data on risk factors, neurodevelopmental and cognitive-function evaluations, laboratory results, and specimens will be collected and analysed. Information on perinatal and clinical interventions for these infants will also be recorded during regular follow-up visits until age 6. Ethics and dissemination The protocol for this study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of GWCMC, which accepted responsibility for supervising all of the aspects of the study (No. 2017102712). Study outcomes will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, the Internet and social media.

TI  - Evaluation of a population health strategy to reduce distracted driving: Examining all "Es" of injury prevention
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Cell phone use while driving (CPWD) increases the risk of crashing and is a major contributor to injuries and deaths. The objective of this study was to describe the evaluation of a multifaceted, evidence-based population health strategy for the reduction of distracted driving. METHODS
   A multipronged campaign was undertaken from 2014 to 2016 for 16- to 44-year-olds, based on epidemiology, focused on personal stories and consequences, using the "Es" of injury prevention (epidemiology, education, environment, enforcement, and evaluation). Education consisted of distracted driving videos, informational cards, a social media AdTube campaign, and a movie theater trailer, which were evaluated with a questionnaire regarding CPWD attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Spatial analysis of data within a geographic information system was used to target advertisements. A random sample telephone survey evaluated public awareness of the campaign. Increased CPWD enforcement was undertaken by police services and evaluated by ARIMA time series modeling. RESULTS
   The AdTube campaign had a view rate of >10% (41,101 views), slightly higher for females. The top performing age group was 18- to 24-year-olds (49%). Our survey found 61% of respondents used handheld CPWD (14% all of the time) with 80% reporting our movie trailer made them think twice about future CPWD. A stakeholder survey and spatial analysis targeted our advertisements in areas of close proximity to high schools, universities, near intersections with previous motor vehicle collisions, high traffic volumes, and population density. A telephone survey revealed that 41% of the respondents were aware of our campaign, 17% from our print and movie theater ads and 3% from social media. Police enforcement campaign blitzes resulted in 160 tickets for CPWD. Following campaign implementation, there was a statistically significant mean decrease of 462 distracted driving citations annually (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION
   A multifaceted, evidence-based population health strategy using the Es of injury prevention with interdisciplinary collaboration is a comprehensive method to be used for the reduction of distracted driving.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of the Bolsa Familia conditional cash transfer program on premature cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using the 100 million Brazilian cohort: a natural experiment study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Brazil's Bolsa Familia Program (BFP) is the world's largest conditional cash transfer scheme. We shall use a large cohort of applicants for different social programmes to evaluate the effect of BFP receipt on premature all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Methods and analysis We will identify BFP recipients and non-recipients among new applicants from 2004 to 2015 in the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort, a database of 114 million individuals containing sociodemographic and mortality information of applicants to any Brazilian social programme. For individuals applying from 2011, when we have better recorded income data, we shall compare premature (age 30-69) cardiovascular and all-cause mortality among BFP recipients and non-recipients using regression discontinuity design (RDD) with household monthly per capita income as the forcing variable. Effects will be estimated using survival models accounting for individuals follow-up. To test the sensitivity of our findings, we will estimate models with different bandwidths, include potential confounders as covariates in the survival models, and restrict our data to locations with the most reliable data. In addition, we will estimate the effect of BFP on studied outcomes using propensity score risk-set matching, separately for individuals that applied <= 2010 and >2011, allowing comparability with RDD. Analyses will be stratified by geographical region, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position. We will investigate differential impacts of BFP and the presence of effect modification for a combination of characteristics, including gender and race/ethnicity. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the ethics committees of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the University of Glasgow College of Medicine and Veterinary Life Sciences. The deidentified dataset will be provided to researchers, and data analysis will be performed in a safe computational environment without internet access. Study findings will be published in high quality peer-reviewed research articles. The published results will be disseminated in the social media and to policy-makers.

TI  - Upper limb disorders in anaesthetists - a survey of Association of Anaesthetists members
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
AB  - Upper limb disorders (affecting the hand, arm and neck) are common. The nature of anaesthetists' work poses a potential extra risk from poor posture that may contribute to the development of upper limb disorders in this professional group. However, to date, the problem has received scant attention in the literature. Following a 2 to 3-month period of publicity via newsletter, email and social media, all 10,231 electronically accessible members of the Association of Anaesthetists were invited by email to complete an online survey that was administered by a third-party company. A total of 3884 usable responses were received (38%). Analysis of possible risk factors found a significant association between upper limb disorders and years since starting anaesthetic training, having children (irrespective of respondents' sex or the number of children) and right-handedness. Years of practice and having children are less modifiable identified risk factors. However, right-handedness may be linked to the ergonomic design of the environment/equipment used within this specialty and may thus be a potentially modifiable risk factor worthy of further investigation.

TI  - Accuracy of prostate cancer screening recommendations for high-risk populations on YouTube and TikTok
T2  - BJUI COMPASS
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate content quality and racial/ethnic representation, particularly of high-risk cohorts, of prostate cancer screening videos on YouTube (YT) and TikTok (TK).Materials and methods: The top 50 videos populated for the search term 'prostate cancer screening' on YT and TK that met inclusion criteria were retrieved in a cache-cleared browser. Three reviewers analysed all videos using validated criteria for the quality of consumer health information (DISCERN and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool [PEMAT]). High quality was defined as follows: DISCERN >= 4, PEMAT understandability >= 75% and PEMAT actionability >= 75%. A 5-point Likert scale was used to demonstrate the level of misinformation compared to American Urological Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Perceived race and ethnicity of people in the videos were assessed by consensus approach.Results: TK videos were shorter (median 3.7 vs. 0.5 min, p < 0.001) and had more views per month (5437.5 vs. 19.3, p = 0.03) than YT videos. Perceived Black and Hispanic representation was present in 10% and 6% of YT videos and 20% and 12% of TK videos, respectively. High-risk racial/ethnic groups were explicitly discussed in 46% of YT videos and 8% of TK videos. A total of 98% of YT videos and 100% of TK videos had low- to moderate-quality consumer health information, and 88% of YT videos and 100% of TK videos had moderate to high levels of misinformation based on screening guidelines.Conclusions: YT and TK videos about prostate cancer screening are widely viewed but do not provide quality consumer health information. Black and Hispanic men remain under-represented on both platforms, and high-risk racial groups were not discussed in most videos despite the importance for screening criteria. The low understandability and actionability, significant misinformation and lack of diversity in online videos support the need for higher quality videos with adequate attention to high-risk ethnic cohorts.

TI  - Risk Health Evaluation and Selection of Preventive Measures Plan with the Help of Argumental Algorithm
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (RCAI 2018)
CP  - 16th Russian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (RCAI)
AB  - The paper describes knowledge base principles and method for disease risk evaluation that were used for intelligent healthcare management system creation. The present version of the knowledge base is implemented using a heterogeneous semantic network approach and utilizes expert opinions about risk factors and events influencing an individual's health. Data includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and external environment. Data is compiled with the aid of questionnaires, mobile devices, case histories and information from social media. Information from social media is analyzed using data and text mining methods with the goal of evaluating the user's condition. All of the data obtained is accumulated in a single database. The method for risk evaluation and preventive measures plan hypotheses generation is based on an argumentation reasoning algorithm that is modified to the task at hand. All prevention recommendations are based on the principles of P4 medicine. The current version of the system is based on expert knowledge obtained by automated monitoring and analysis of a large number of publications and recommendations on this topic.

TI  - Discovery and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns: unravelling chronicity networks and their social profiles
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Multimorbidity can be defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases in an individual. This condition is associated with reduced quality of life, increased disability, greater functional impairment, increased health care utilisation, greater fragmentation of care and complexity of treatment, and increased mortality. Thus, understanding its epidemiology and inherent complexity is essential to improve the quality of life of patients and to reduce the costs associated with multi-pathology. In this paper, using data from the European Health Survey, we explore the application of Mixed Graphical Models and its combination with social network analysis techniques for the discovery and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns. The results obtained show the usefulness and versatility of this approach for the study of multimorbidity based on the use of graphs, which offer the researcher a holistic view of the relational structure of data with variables of different types and high dimensionality.

TI  - Digital Global Recruitment for Women's Health Research: Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: With the increased popularity of mobile menstrual tracking apps and boosted Facebook posts, there is a unique opportunity to recruit research study participants from across the globe via these modalities to evaluate women's health. However, no studies to date have assessed the feasibility of using these recruitment sources for epidemiological research on ovulation and menstruation.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of recruiting a diverse sample of women to an epidemiological study of ovulation and menstruation (OM) health (OM Global Health Study) using digital recruitment sources. The feasibility and diversity were assessed via click and participation rates, geographic location, BMI, smoking status, and other demographic information.
   Methods: Participants were actively recruited via in-app messages using the menstrual tracking app Clue (BioWink GmbH) and a boosted Facebook post by DivaCup (Diva International Inc.). Other passive recruitment methods also took place throughout the recruitment period (eg, email communications, blogs, other social media). The proportion of participants who visited the study website after viewing and clicking the hypertext link (click rates) in the in-app messages and boosted Facebook post and the proportion of participants who completed the surveys per the number of completed consent and eligibility screeners (participation rates) were used to quantify the success of recruiting participants to the study website and study survey completion, respectively. Survey completion was defined as finishing the pregnancy and birth history section of the OM Global Health Study questionnaire.
   Results: The recruitment period was from February 27, 2018, through January 24, 2020. In-app messages and the boosted Facebook post were seen by 104,000 and 21,400 people, respectively. Overall, 215 participants started the OM Global Health Study survey, of which 140 (65.1%), 39 (18.1%), and 36 (16.8%) participants were recruited via the app, the boosted Facebook post, and other passive recruitment methods, respectively. The click rate via the app was 18.9% (19,700 clicks/104,000 ad views) and 1.6% via the boosted Facebook post (340 clicks/21,400 ad views.) The overall participation rate was 44.6% (198/444), and the average participant age was 21.8 (SD 6.1) years. In terms of geographic and racial/ethnic diversity, 91 (44.2%) of the participants resided outside the United States and 147 (70.7%) identified as non-Hispanic White. In-app recruitment produced the most geographically diverse stream, with 44 (32.8%) of the 134 participants in Europe, 77 (57.5%) in North America, and 13 (9.8%) in other parts of the world. Both human error and nonhuman procedural breakdowns occurred during the recruitment process, including a computer programming error related to age eligibility and a hacking attempt by an internet bot.
   Conclusions: In-app messages using the menstrual tracking app Clue were the most successful method for recruiting participants from many geographic regions and producing the greatest numbers of started and completed surveys. This study demonstrates the utility of digital recruitment to enroll participants from diverse geographic locations and provides some lessons to avoid technical recruitment errors in future digital recruitment strategies for epidemiological research.

T2  - AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES
AB  - One cannot spend >5 min on social media at the moment without finding a link to some conspiracy theory or other regarding the origin of SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. From the virus being deliberately released as a bioweapon to pharmaceutical companies blocking the trials of natural remedies to boost their dangerous drugs and vaccines, the Internet is rife with far-fetched rumors. And predictably, now that the first immunization trials have started, the antivaccine lobby has latched on to most of them. In the last week, the trailer for a new "bombshell documentary" Plandemic has been doing the rounds, gaining notoriety for being repeatedly removed from YouTube and Facebook. We usually would not pay much heed to such things, but for retrovirologists like us, the name associated with these claims is unfortunately too familiar: Dr. Judy Mikovits.

TI  - Counterpoint: Preprints and the Future of Scientific Publishing-In Favor of Relevance
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Peer-reviewed journals provide an invaluable but inadequate vehicle for scientific communication. Preprints are now an essential complement to peer-reviewed publications. Eschewing preprints will slow scientific progress and reduce the public health impact of epidemiologic research. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted long-standing limitations of the peer-review process. Preprint servers, such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, served as crucial venues to rapidly disseminate research and provide detailed backup to sound-bite science that is often communicated through the popular press or social media. The major criticisms of preprints arise from an unjustified optimism about peer review. Peer review provides highly imperfect sorting and curation of research and only modest improvements in research conduct or presentation for most individual papers. The advantages of peer review come at the expense of months to years of delay in sharing research methods or results. For time-sensitive evidence, these delays can lead to important missteps and ill-advised policies. Even with research that is not intrinsically urgent, preprints expedite debate, expand engagement, and accelerate progress. The risk that poor-quality papers will have undue influence because they are posted on a preprint server is low. If epidemiology aims to deliver evidence relevant for public health, we need to embrace strategic uses of preprint servers.

TI  - Conducting a multi-country online alcohol survey in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: Opportunities and challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METHODS IN PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives This contribution provides insights into the methodology of a pan-European population-based online survey, performed without external funding during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the impact of different dissemination strategies to collect data from a non-probabilistic convenience sample and outline post-stratification weighting schemes, to provide guidance for future multi-country survey studies.
   Methods Description and comparison of dissemination strategies for five exemplary countries (Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Spain) participating in the Alcohol Use and COVID-19 Survey. Comparison of the sample distribution with the country's actual population distribution according to sociodemographics, and development of weighting schemes.
   Results The dissemination of online surveys through national newspapers, paid social media adverts and dissemination with the support of national health ministries turned out to be the most effective strategies. Monitoring the responses and adapting dissemination strategies to reach under-represented groups, and the application of sample weights were helpful to achieve an analytic sample matching the respective general population profiles.
   Conclusion Reaching a large pan-European convenience sample, including most European countries, in a short time was feasible, with the support of a broad scientific network.

TI  - Predictors of outcome in sciatica patients following an epidural steroid injection: the POiSE prospective observational cohort study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionSciatica can be very painful and, in most cases, is due to pressure on a spinal nerve root from a disc herniation with associated inflammation. For some patients, the pain persists, and one management option is a spinal epidural steroid injection (ESI). The aim of an ESI is to relieve leg pain, improve function and reduce the need for surgery. ESIs work well in some patients but not in others, but we cannot identify these patient subgroups currently. This study aims to identify factors, including patient characteristics, clinical examination and imaging findings, that help in predicting who does well and who does not after an ESI. The overall objective is to develop a prognostic model to support individualised patient and clinical decision-making regarding ESI.MethodsPOiSE is a prospective cohort study of 439 patients with sciatica referred by their clinician for an ESI. Participants will receive weekly text messages until 12 weeks following their ESIand then again at 24 weeks following their ESI to collect data on leg pain severity. Questionnaires will be sent to participants at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after their ESI to collect data on pain, disability, recovery and additional interventions. The prognosis for the cohort will be described. The primary outcome measure for the prognostic model is leg pain at 6 weeks. Prognostic models will also be developed for secondary outcomes of disability and recovery at 6 weeks and additional interventions at 24 weeks following ESI. Statistical analyses will include multivariable linear and logistic regression with mixed effects model.Ethics and disseminationThe POiSE study has received ethical approval (South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee 21/SC/0257). Dissemination will be guided by our patient and public engagement group and will include scientific publications, conference presentations and social media.

TI  - A Primer on the Data Cleaning Pipeline
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURVEY STATISTICS AND METHODOLOGY
AB  - The availability of both structured and unstructured databases, such as electronic health data, social media data, patent data, and surveys that are often updated in real time, among others, has grown rapidly over the past decade. With this expansion, the statistical and methodological questions around data integration, or rather merging multiple data sources, have also grown. Specifically, the science of the "data cleaning pipeline" contains four stages that allow an analyst to perform downstream tasks, predictive analyses, or statistical analyses on "cleaned data." This article provides a review of this emerging field, introducing technical terminology and commonly used methods.

T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
AB  - Spatial data volumes have grown exponentially over the past several years. The number of domains that spatial data are extensively leveraged include atmospheric sciences, environmental monitoring, ecological modeling, epidemiology, sociology, commerce, and social media among others. These data are often used to understand phenomena and inform decision-making by fitting models to them. In this study, we present our methodology to fit models at scale over spatial data. Our methodology encompasses segmentation, spatial similarity based on the dataset(s) under consideration, and transfer learning schemes that are informed by the spatial similarity to train models faster while utilizing fewer resources. We consider several model fitting algorithms and execution within containerized environments as we profile the suitability of our methodology. Our benchmarks validate the suitability of our methodology to facilitate faster, resource-efficient training of models over spatial data.

TI  - The role of weight- and appearance-related discrimination on eating disorder symptoms among adolescents and emerging adults
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Eating disorder symptoms (EDs) have been discussed as a prominent problem among late adolescent girls with serious health risks and long-term consequences. However, there is a lack of population-based evidence on EDs comprising the age range from early adolescence to emerging adulthood as well as considering both females and males equally. Additionally, the differential role of a comprehensive set of several relevant risk factors and particularly weight- and appearance-related discrimination warrants further attention. Thus, we aimed to contribute to a better understanding of sex- and age-related differences in associations between discrimination experience and other relevant personal risk factors (body image, social media use, self-efficacy, social support) with EDs. Furthermore, we were interested in the exploration of underlying mechanisms enhancing the risk of EDs by taking discrimination experience into account. Methods Based on a logistic regression model, we investigated associations between weight- and appearance-related discrimination and EDs while controlling for other relevant personal risk factors in a subsample of N = 8504 adolescents and emerging adults (54.4% female, mean age = 20.71 years, SD = 4.32 years) drawn from a German representative health survey (KiGGS Wave 2). In a second step, we investigated the mediating role of discrimination experience between the other risk factors and EDs with the help of a path model. Results While controlling for other relevant personal risk factors, weight- and appearance-related discrimination was significantly related to EDs. Whereas the risk of EDs was significantly enhanced in males and emerging adults frequently experiencing weight-related discrimination, adolescents showed a higher risk of EDs when experiencing appearance-related discrimination. Moreover, discrimination experience partly explained the associations between body image dissatisfaction, low self-efficacy, high media use and ED symptoms. Conclusions The results highlight weight- and appearance-related discrimination as one central factor to be considered in the pathogeneses of EDs and underpin the need for discrimination prevention as well as the promotion of adaptive coping with discrimination experience to reduce the risk of developing ED symptoms. Males and emerging adults need particular attention when facing weight-related discrimination whereas risk constellations and EDs particularly affecting females need further investigation.

TI  - Exploring the use of entertainment-education YouTube videos focused on infection prevention and control
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB  - Background: As a communications strategy, education entertainment has been used to inform, influence, and shift societal and individual behaviors. Recently, there has been an increasing number of entertainment-education YouTube videos focused on hand hygiene. However, there is currently no understanding about the quality of these videos; therefore, this study aimed to explore the social media content and user engagement with these videos.
   Methods: The search terms "hand hygiene" and "hand hygiene education" were used to query YouTube. Video content had to be directed at a health care professional audience. Using author designed checklists, each video was systematically evaluated and grouped according to educational usefulness and was subsequently evaluated against the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness.
   Results: A total of 400 videos were screened, with 70 videos retained for analysis. Of these, 55.7%(n = 39) were categorized as educationally useful. Overall, educationally useful videos scored higher than noneducationally useful videos across the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness. Miscommunication of the concept of My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene was observed in several of the YouTube videos.
   Conclusions: The availability of educationally useful videos in relation to hand hygiene is evident; however, it is clear that there are opportunities for contributors using this medium to strengthen their alignment with social media best practice principles to maximize the effectiveness, reach, and sustainability of their content.

TI  - Schizophrenia on Turkish Twitter: an exploratory study investigating misuse, stigmatization and trivialization
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate use and misuse of the word 'schizophrenia' and its derivatives to assess the prevalence of stigmatizing and trivializing attitudes and the meanings attributed to the condition on Turkish Twitter. Methods Using R programming language, we collected Turkish Twitter posts containing the terms used for schizophrenia in Turkish through Twitter's Search API over a 47-day period between July and June 2019. After removing retweets, we randomly sampled 3000 tweets and manually categorized them in three dimensions: use type (metaphorical/non-metaphorical), topic and attitude. Qualitative analysis on representative tweets were performed and word frequencies were calculated. Results In total 44,266 tweets were collected and after removing retweets, 24,529 tweets were obtained. Overwhelming majority of the tweets (91.7%) used the terms metaphorically and the majority displayed stigmatizing (68.3%) and trivializing (23%) attitudes. Politics was the most common topic (58.2%) followed by everyday/social chatter (28.5%). Only a small number of tweets were part of awareness campaigns (0.2%) or displayed a supportive attitude (0.8%). Terms were often used metaphorically in a stigmatizing manner as personal or political insults, while in everyday/social contexts, they were used in a trivializing manner to label eccentricity, oddness, overthinking and suspiciousness. Popularity and reach metrics show that these tweets were extensively retweeted, liked and reached millions of users. Conclusion This is the first study investigating attitudes towards schizophrenia on Turkish Twitter. Significantly higher rates of stigmatizing attitudes demonstrate the urgent need for public health and social awareness campaigns targeting stigma surrounding schizophrenia in Turkey.

TI  - Cannabis Use in Pregnancy and Downstream effects on maternal and infant health (CUPiD): a protocol for a birth cohort pilot study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Cannabis use in pregnancy and post partum is increasing. Accessibility to cannabis has expanded due to the legalisation of cannabis in Canada. Therefore, there is a critical need to monitor the impact of cannabis on pregnancy outcomes and infant neurodevelopment. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of modern recruitment and data collection strategies adapted to the current cannabis environment and inform the design of a multicentre prospective birth cohort.Methods and analysis We will establish a pregnancy and birth cohort of 50 cannabis users and 50 non-users recruited before delivery. We will follow the participants at regular visits from recruitment to 12 weeks post partum. Participants will provide demographic and socioeconomic data, report their cannabis use patterns, and provide biological samples. Biological samples include maternal and infant urine and blood, breastmilk/chestmilk, cord blood, cord tissue, placenta and meconium. All samples will be processed and stored at -80 & DEG;C until analysis by immunoassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the presence of cannabis metabolites. In addition, partners will be invited to provide additional socioeconomic and substance use data.Ethics and dissemination Ethics was obtained from Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board through Clinical Trials Ontario (3791). Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific conferences and shared broadly with patients, healthcare decision-makers, and project partners online and through social media.

TI  - Using the STROBE statement: survey findings emphasized the role of journals in enforcing reporting guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study was to identify factors affecting the use of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, specifically authors' attitudes toward and experiences with it.
   Study Design and Setting: An online survey was distributed to authors of observational studies recruited via social media, personal network snowballing, and mass mailings using targeted search strategies. Data on demographics, awareness, motivators, and usage were collected in conjunction with a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) scale on which confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed.
   Results: One thousand fifteen participants completed the survey. Of these, 185 (18.2%) indicated they had never heard of STROBE nor used it previously, 195 (19.2%) had heard of it but never used it, and 635 (62.6%) had used it. Journals promoting STROBE were both key motivators and awareness mechanisms; peers and educational workshops were also important influencing factors to a lesser degree. The internal consistency of the modified UTAUT scale was strong (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94). CFA supported a four-factor model with 23 questions.
   Conclusion: The endorsement of STROBE by journals is key to authors' awareness and use of the guideline. We tested and validated our scale which can guide future research on reporting guidelines. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Characterizing diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity comments on Twitter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with "Diabetes", excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for "Diet" included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for "Exercise" included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for "Obesity" included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.

TI  - Day-to-day variability of knee pain and the relationship with physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis: an observational, feasibility study using consumer smartwatches
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of using smartwatches in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) to determine the day-to-day variability of pain and the relationship between daily pain and step count.DesignObservational, feasibility study.SettingIn July 2017, the study was advertised in newspapers, magazines and, on social media. Participants had to be living/willing to travel to Manchester. Recruitment was in September 2017 and data collection was completed in January 2018.Participants26 participants aged>50 years with self-diagnosed symptomatic knee OA were recruited.Outcome measuresParticipants were provided with a consumer cellular smartwatch with a bespoke app that triggered a series of daily questions including two times per day questions about level of knee pain and one time per month question from the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. The smartwatch also recorded daily step counts.ResultsOf the 25 participants, 13 were men and their mean age was 65 years (standard deviation (SD) 8 years). The smartwatch app was successful in simultaneously assessing and recording data on knee pain and step count in real time. Knee pain was categorised into sustained high/low or fluctuating levels, but there was considerable day-to-day variation within these categories. Levels of knee pain in general correlated with pain assessed by KOOS. Those with sustained high/low levels of pain had a similar daily step count average (mean 3754 (SD 2524)/4307 (SD 2992)), but those with fluctuating pain had much lower step count levels (mean 2064 (SD 1716)).ConclusionsSmartwatches can be used to assess pain and physical activity in knee OA. Larger studies may help inform a better understanding of causal links between physical activity patterns and pain. In time, this could inform development of personalised physical activity recommendations for people with knee OA.

TI  - Online behavioural patterns for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United Kingdom
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic offers a unique opportunity to conduct an infodemiological study examining patterns in online searching activity about a specific disease and how this relates to news media within a specific country. Google Trends quantifies volumes of online activity. The relative search volume was obtained for 'Coronavirus', 'handwashing', 'face mask' and symptom related keywords, for the United Kingdom, from the date of the first confirmed case until numbers peaked in April. The relationship between online search traffic and confirmed case numbers was examined. Search volumes varied over time; peaks appear related to events in the progression of the epidemic which were reported in the media. Search activity on 'Coronavirus' correlated well against confirmed case number as did 'face mask' and symptom-related keywords. User-generated online data sources such as Google Trends may aid disease surveillance, being more responsive to changes in disease occurrence than traditional disease reporting. The relationship between media coverage and online searching activity is rarely examined, but may be driving online behavioural patterns.

TI  - Monkeypox as a potential emerging pandemic: a discussion on future risks and preparedness in Saudi Arabia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by the Monkeypox virus, has emerged as a potential threat with pandemic potential in various regions. While it is challenging to predict specific outbreaks, understanding the factors contributing to Monkeypox's pandemic potential is important. This discussion paper explores the future risks and preparedness measures concerning Monkeypox in Saudi Arabia. The study reviews the past and current knowledge on the Monkeypox outbreak, including its clinical presentation, transmission dynamics (animals-to-humans and humans-to-human), epidemiology, and diagnostic methods. Furthermore, it explores the potential risk factors for the spread of Monkeypox within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, mainly in the Saudi Arabian context, considering factors such as urbanization and travel and trade patterns. The paper emphasizes the importance of early virus detection, surveillance systems, and laboratory capacity in vaccinating and responding to Monkeypox cases. Additionally, it highlights the future risks and preparedness in Saudi Arabia and the usage of social media during the pandemic seeking support and awareness about Monkeypox, and it also highlights the need for effective communication strategies of leaders through social media channels to disseminate accurate information to the public, healthcare providers, and policymakers. The discussion concludes by calling for collaborative efforts among health authorities, researchers, and international medical partners to enhance surveillance, develop outbreak response plans, and ensure the availability of vaccines and treatment options. This research serves as a foundation for guiding future preventive measures and strengthening the overall preparedness of Saudi Arabia in facing the potential emergence of Monkeypox as a future pandemic.

TI  - Sociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research: A scoping review
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - BackgroundSociometric or whole network analysis, a method used to analyze relational patterns among social actors, emphasizes the role of social structure in shaping behaviour. Such method has been applied to many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO) returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree centrality (72.2%) and density (44.4%). Studies were found to belong to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to study drug policy.

TI  - The quality of YouTube videos on endoscopic third ventriculostomy and endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization procedures available to families of patients with pediatric hydrocephalus
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB  - OBJECTIVE YouTube has become an important information source for pediatric neurosurgical patients and their families. The goal of this study was to determine whether the informative quality of videos of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV +CPC) is associated with metrics of popularity.
   METHODS This cross-sectional study used comprehensive search terms to identify videos pertaining to ETV and ETV + CPC presented on the first 3 pages of search results on YouTube. Two pediatric neurosurgeons, 1 neurosurgery resident, and 2 patient families independently reviewed the selected videos. Videos were assessed for overall informational quality by using a validated 5-point Global Quality Score (GQS) and compared to online metrics of popularity and engagement such as views, likes, likes/views ratio, comments/views ratio, and likes/dislikes ratio. Weighted kappa scores were used to measure agreement between video reviewers.
   RESULTS A total of 58 videos (47 on ETV, 7 on ETV + CPC, 4 on both) of 120 videos assessed met the inclusion criteria. Video styles included "technical" (62%), "lecture" (24%), "patient testimonial" (4%), and "other" (10%). In terms of GQS, substantial agreement was seen between surgeons (kappa 0.67 [95% CI 0.55, 0.801) and excellent agreement was found between each surgeon and the neurosurgical resident (0.77 [95% CI 0.66, 0.88] and 0.89 [95% CI 0.82, 0.97]). Only fair to moderate agreement was seen between professionals and patient families, with weighted kappa scores ranging from 0.07 to 0.56. Academic lectures were more likely to be rated good or excellent (64% vs 0%, p < 0.001) versus surgical procedure and testimonial video types. There were significant associations between a better GQS and more likes (p = 0.01), views (p = 0.02), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p = 0.016). The likes/views ratio (p = 0.31) and comments/views ratio (p = 0.35) were not associated with GQS. The number of likes (p = 0.02), views (p = 0.03), and the likes/dislikes ratio (p = 0.015) were significantly associated with video style (highest for lecture-style videos).
   CONCLUSIONS Medical professionals tended to agree when assessing the overall quality of YouTube videos, but this agreement was not as strongly seen when compared to parental ratings. The online metrics of likes, views, and likes/dislikes ratio appear to predict quality. Neurosurgeons seeking to increase their online footprint via YouTube would be well advised to focus more on the academic lecture style because these were universally better rated.

TI  - Examining undergraduate student retention in mathematics using network analysis and relative risk
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Higher education faces challenges in retaining students who require a command of numeracy in their chosen field of study. This study applies an innovative combination of relative risk and social network analysis to enrolment data of a single cohort of commencing students from an Australian regional university. Relative risk, often used in epidemiology studies, is used to strategically investigate whether first year mathematics subjects at the university demonstrated a higher risk of attrition when compared to other subjects offered in the first year of study. The network analysis is used to illustrate the connections of those mathematics subjects, identifying service subjects through their multiple connections. The analysis revealed that attrition rates for eight of the nine subjects were within acceptable limits, and this included identified service subjects. The exception highlighted the issue of mathematics competencies in this cohort. This combined analytical technique is proposed as appropriate for use when investigating attrition and retention at faculty and institutional levels, including the determination of levels of intervention and support for any subject.

TI  - Estimation and variable selection for high-dimensional spatial data models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS
AB  - Spatiotemporal modeling of networks is of great practical importance, with modern applications in epidemiology and social network analysis. Despite rapid methodological advances, how to effectively and efficiently estimate the parameters of spatial dynamic panel models remains a challenging problem. To tackle this problem, we construct consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model. Extensive simulation studies and data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Conceptualising the social networks of vulnerable children and young people: a systematic review and narrative synthesis
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose The relationship between social networks and health and wellbeing is increasingly demonstrated in vulnerable adult populations. This relationship for vulnerable children and young people has not hitherto been systematically reviewed. This narrative synthesis aims to consolidate research to provide a foundational basis for future health-related social network research and interventions for children and young people. Methods This mixed methods systematic review synthesises research investigating whole, egocentric social networks of 32 vulnerable child groups with a mean age below 18. There were no setting, language or date restrictions. The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 6360 search results, 49 were included for narrative synthesis. Results The majority of pertinent research originates from the USA; the most frequently investigated vulnerabilities were minority ethnic status, homelessness and the presence of special educational needs. Research aims and methodologies varied significantly between studies. Key findings included (i) vulnerable (excluding minority ethnic) children and young people have impoverished networks (ii) access to networks is a protective factor against negative outcomes (iii) social ties, primarily immediate family, provide access to personal resources and (iv) network ties are to a degree substitutable. Conclusions Networks are associated with wellbeing and vulnerable children and young people commonly have impoverished networks, excluding cases where vulnerability classification relates to minority ethnic status. Network embeddedness is associated with positive outcomes, particularly for homeless children. Family are typically primary providers of support, but ties are substitutable when networks are restricted. Egocentric social network research is currently limited for vulnerable child populations. Further research could inform interventions that harness networks to improve health, wellbeing and functional outcomes for these child groups.

TI  - Graph Anomaly Detection Based on Steiner Connectivity and Density
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB  - Detecting "hotspots" and "anomalies" is a recurring problem with a wide range of applications, such as social network analysis, epidemiology, finance, and biosurveillance, among others. Networks are a common abstraction in these applications for representing complex relationships. Typically, these networks are dynamic-, i.e., they evolve over time. A number of methods have been proposed for anomaly detection in such dynamic network data sets, which are primarily based on changes in network properties. We provide a survey of the various formulations of anomaly detection in dynamic networks with a focus on "window-based" methods. Window-based methods first define a time window of past network snapshots to model normal behavior and then mark a snapshot as anomalous if it has significantly different patterns from those observed in the time window. We describe two classes of techniques: 1) generalizations of Steiner connectivity; and 2) dense subgraph mining. Both have been used extensively in window-based graph anomaly detection. We summarize the key problem formulations that have been studied using these approaches, and we describe details of some of the main techniques.

TI  - Addressing bias in artificial intelligence for public health surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Components of artificial intelligence (AI) for analysing social big data, such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, have improved the timeliness and robustness of health data. NLP techniques have been implemented to analyse large volumes of text from social media platforms to gain insights on disease symptoms, understand barriers to care and predict disease outbreaks. However, AI-based decisions may contain biases that could misrepresent populations, skew results or lead to errors. Bias, within the scope of this paper, is described as the difference between the predictive values and true values within the modelling of an algorithm. Bias within algorithms may lead to inaccurate healthcare outcomes and exacerbate health disparities when results derived from these biased algorithms are applied to health interventions. Researchers who implement these algorithms must consider when and how bias may arise. This paper explores algorithmic biases as a result of data collection, labelling and modelling of NLP algorithms. Researchers have a role in ensuring that efforts towards combating bias are enforced, especially when drawing health conclusions derived from social media posts that are linguistically diverse. Through the implementation of open collaboration, auditing processes and the development of guidelines, researchers may be able to reduce bias and improve NLP algorithms that improve health surveillance.

TI  - Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a pre-existing mental health condition: Findings from American trend panel survey
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB  - Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery.

TI  - Evaluation of different machine learning approaches and input text representations for multilingual classification of tweets for disease surveillance in the social web
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB  - Twitter and social media as a whole have great potential as a source of disease surveillance data however the general messiness of tweets presents several challenges for standard information extraction methods. Most deployed systems employ approaches that rely on simple keyword matching and do not distinguish between relevant and irrelevant keyword mentions making them susceptible to false positives as a result of the fact that keyword volume can be influenced by several social phenomena that may be unrelated to disease occurrence. Furthermore, most solutions are intended for a single language and those meant for multilingual scenarios do not incorporate semantic context. In this paper we experimentally examine different approaches for classifying text for epidemiological surveillance on the social web in addition we offer a systematic comparison of the impact of different input representations on performance. Specifically we compare continuous representations against one-hot encoding for word-based, class-based (ontology-based) and subword units in the form of byte pair encodings. We also go on to establish the desirable performance characteristics for multi-lingual semantic filtering approaches and offer an in-depth discussion of the implications for end-to-end surveillance.

TI  - Depressive and anxious symptoms among young adults in the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from monitoring the future
T2  - DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
AB  - Purpose The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is associated with worsening mental health among young adults, but further research is necessary to quantify the associations with depression and anxiety. Methods Using Monitoring the Future data (N = 1244 young adults, modal age: 19, Fall 2020 supplement), we examined internalizing symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 separately), dividing the sample into those without clinically significant scores, significant scores but minimal pandemic-attributed symptoms, and significant scores with substantial pandemic-attributed symptoms. Logistic regression analyses linked demographic factors, pandemic-related experiences, and coping methods to symptom groups. Results Internalizing symptoms were highly prevalent, with many occurring among a majority at least several days over the past 2 weeks. Major changes in education, employment, and resource availability predicted elevated symptom risk (e.g., lacking a place to sleep or money for rent, gas, or food led to 4.43 [95% confidence interval: 2.59-7.55] times the risk of high depressive symptoms significantly attributed to the pandemic). High internalizing symptoms were linked to underutilization of healthy coping behaviors, substance use overutilization, and dietary changes. High depressive and anxious symptoms attributed to the pandemic were marked by high levels of taking breaks from the news/social media and contacting healthcare providers. Conclusions The pandemic's associations with young adults' depressive and anxious symptoms warrants urgent attention through improved mental health treatment infrastructure and stronger structural support.

TI  - B Part of It protocol: a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of 4CMenB vaccine on pharyngeal carriage of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> in adolescents
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction South Australia (SA) has the highest notification rate of invasive meningococcal disease in Australia with the majority of cases due to serogroup B. Neisseria meningitidis is carried in the pharynx, with adolescents having the highest rates of carriage. A vaccine designed to offer protection against serogroup B (4CMenB) is licensed in Australia. The SA MenB vaccine carriage study aims to assess the impact of 4CMenB on carriage of N. meningitidis in adolescents.
   Methods and analysis This is a parallel cluster randomised controlled trial enrolling year 10, 11 and 12 school students (approximately 16-18 years of age) throughout SA, in metropolitan and rural/remote areas. Schools are randomised to intervention (4CMenB vaccination at baseline) or control (4CMenB vaccination at study completion) with randomisation stratified by school size and socioeconomic status, as measured by the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (Australian Curriculum). Oropharyngeal swabs will be taken from all students at visit 1, and 12 months later from year 11 and 12 students. Students unvaccinated in 2017 will receive vaccine at the 12-month follow-up. Carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis will be determined by PCR at baseline and 12 months following 4CMenB vaccination and compared with carriage prevalence at 12 months in unvaccinated students. A questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 12 months to assess risk factors associated with carriage. The primary outcome of carriage prevalence of disease causing N. meningitidis at 12 months will be compared between groups using logistic regression, with generalised estimating equations used to account for clustering at the school level. The difference in carriage prevalence between groups will be expressed as an OR with 95% CI.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Women's and Children's Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (WCHN HREC). The protocol, informed consent forms, recruitment materials, social media and all participant materials have been reviewed and approved by the WCHN HREC and updated on ClinicalTrials.gov. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. The study findings will be provided in public forums and to study participants and participating schools.

TI  - Association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health in older adults: an analysis of data from the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The adverse health effects of individual-level social isolation (e.g., perceived loneliness) have been well documented in older adults. However, little is known about the impact of collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought to examine the association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults.
   METHODS: From the prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who were aged >= 60 years or were married to those aged >= 60 years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups separate from the major social group were defined as group-level-segregated. The CVH score was calculated as the number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and CVH.
   RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years; 60.0% female), 108 (20.5%) were segregated at baseline. In the cross-sectional analysis, group-level segregation was significantly associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at baseline after adjusting for socio-demographic factors and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.95). Among 274 participants who completed an 8-year follow-up, group-level segregation at baseline was marginally associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse CVH. These findings imply that the social network structure of a community may influence its members' health status.

TI  - Longitudinal survey on the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Healthcare Workers (PsyCOVer) in France: study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction In the pandemic, healthcare professionals face even higher levels of stress. It is therefore a priority to estimate the impact of the pandemic on mental health and to propose targeted strategies to improve resilience. The aims of the study were to (1) assess the mental health of healthcare professionals working with patients with COVID-19 and identify social determinants that may increase the risk of negative outcomes; and (2) test the effectiveness of an intervention to improve the resilience of healthcare professionals in France. Methods and analysis To evaluate the first objective, a national longitudinal study will be carried out among healthcare professionals working with patients with COVID-19. Participants will be recruited via an internet link that will be widely disseminated on social media, mailing lists, medical boards and French medical journals. Primary outcomes are mental health distress/symptoms and resilience. Secondary outcomes are burnout, social and occupational supports and substance use. To meet the second objective, an interventional study will be conducted. The main outcome is the effectiveness of the PsySTART-Responder and the Anticipate.Plan.Deter program. Qualitative analyses will be conducted to understand the strategies used to cope with the pandemic. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Sorbonne Universite Ethical Committee (No 2020-CER-2020-27) and was declared to French Commission on Information Technology and Liberties, CNIL (N degrees 2222413, 20-05-2021). The results of this study will provide a better understanding of mental health and social inequalities in mental health among healthcare professionals working in the pandemic; data about the effectiveness of the PsySTART-Responder and the Anticipate.Plan.Deter interventional program in France.

TI  - Factors associated with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among medical students in Cameroon: a web-based cross-sectional study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic mental disorder that is associated with poor productivity, with a significant impact on the quality of life. Objectives To determine factors associated with symptoms of ADHD among medical students in Cameroon. Design A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting Participants were recruited through a social media platform, WhatsApp, from 24 June to 2 September 2018. Participants Medical students aged 18 years and older from seven medical schools in Cameroon. All non-medical students and all medical residents were excluded. Results Data from a total of 491 eligible participants were analysed. The median age was 25 (IQR 21-25) years and 54% were of the participants were female. The prevalence of self-reported symptoms of ADHD was 24.4% (95% CI 20.6% to 28.3%). Histories of chronic disease (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.96; 95% CI 1.49 to 5.86, p=0.002), family history of ADHD (AOR 3.38; 95% CI 1.04 to 10.44, p=0.035), severe depression (AOR=3.49; 95% CI 1.82 to 6.77, p<0.001) and anxiety disorder (AOR 2.06; 95% CI 1.25 to 3.36, p=0.004) were found to be independently associated with the symptoms of ADHD. Conclusion ADHD may be a highly prevalent mental disorder among medical students, and is associated with severe depression, anxiety disorders and chronic diseases. There is a need to conduct a large-scale prospective cohort study with interviews to estimate the true prevalence and incidence of ADHD among medical students in Cameroon, and to determinant the risk factors associated with the disorder.

TI  - Extent, duration and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding in a longitudinal study: adjusting for missing data using an accelerated failure time model and multiple imputation
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends at least 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Longitudinal studies facilitate estimation of EBF duration, but often suffer from loss to follow-up and missing information. The study estimates the prevalence of EBF, duration and predictors of EBF duration while adjusting for missing data using multiple imputation (MI).
   Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted on all women giving birth between September 2009-February 2010 in selected hospitals (N=2119). Data on EBF and socio-demographic and other characteristics were collected at birth, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. Information on EBF status and duration was missing for 29%. To deal with missing data, we generated multiple datasets using logistic regression-based MI to impute missing EBF practice, and an accelerated failure time (AFT) model to impute missing duration of EBF. The latter model also identified factors associated with EBF duration.
   Results: The observed 64% of women practicing EBF (95% CI; 62%-66%) was adjusted, after imputation, to 62% (95% CI; 60%-65%). After imputation, the estimated median time of EBF among women practicing EBF was 4.9 months. Predictors of EBF duration were stated intention to breastfeed, religious observance, and giving formula milk while in hospital.
   Conclusion: Adjusting estimates of EBF practice and duration using MI is feasible and potentially important. Using an AFT model for EBF duration enables the execution of MI in such studies and allows direct interpretation of the impact of various factors on EBF duration.

TI  - Estimating the potential for disease spread in horses associated with an equestrian show in Ontario, Canada using an agent-based model
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Participation in equestrian shows provides opportunities for contact between horses, increasing the risk of disease introduction and spread within the population. The magnitude of a potential outbreak, and the impact of disease prevention and control strategies, can be estimated using simulation modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the potential spread of equine influenza in a network of horses associated with a 2-day equestrian show in Ontario, Canada; and (2) determine the effectiveness of several interventions during a simulated outbreak. A discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic agent-based simulation model was constructed to represent horses associated with the show, including those in attendance at the show, and those that were not in attendance but co-boarded with attending horses at their home facilities. At the beginning of each simulation run, one random horse in attendance at the show was infected with equine influenza. In the absence of interventions, the median attack rate was 0.029 (IQR: 0.016-0.056; mean: 0.043; 95% CI: 0.040-0.044) and the average outbreak duration was 19.58 days (95% CI: 19.31-19.85). The most effective intervention was the implementation of either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period, which both resulted in the same median attack rate of 0.0026 (IQR 0.0013-0.0039), although the mean attack rates differed (mean: 0.0043, 95% CI: 0.0039-0.0046; and mean: 0.0029, 95% CI: 0.0028-0.0029; respectively). In instances where implementing either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period would not be feasible, quarantine for shorter time periods was effective when combined with targeted increases in initial facility-level vaccine coverage. The combined implementation of a 2-day quarantine period and an increased vaccine coverage of 75% in facilities with four or more owners resulted in a median attack rate of 0.013 (IQR: 0.0052-0.026; mean: 0.022; 95% CI: 0.020-0.024). This study demonstrates a relative comparison of intervention effectiveness during a simulated outbreak of equine influenza in a population of horses associated with an equestrian show. The results have the potential to inform and improve the current strategies used to prevent the introduction and spread of disease within the equine population.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease: results of a worldwide survey
T2  - RMD OPEN
AB  - Objective There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 disproportionately affects people from racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. Methods We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. Results 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic. Conclusion In this sample of rheumatologists from 64 countries, there is a clear shift in practice to telehealth video consultations and widespread concern for socially and economically vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease.

T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - Analyses of search engine and social media feeds have been attempted for infectious disease outbreaks, but have been found to be susceptible to artefactual distortions from health scares or keyword spamming in social media or the public internet. We describe an approach using real-time aggregation of keywords and phrases of freetext from real-time clinician-generated documentation in electronic health records to produce a customisable real-time viral pneumonia signal providing up to 4 days warning for secondary care capacity planning. This low-cost approach is open-source, is locally customisable, is not dependent on any specific electronic health record system and can provide an ensemble of signals if deployed at multiple organisational scales.

TI  - Aggregating Twitter Text through Generalized Linear Regression Models for Tweet Popularity Prediction and Automatic Topic Classification
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATION IN HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION
AB  - Social media platforms have become accessible resources for health data analysis. However, the advanced computational techniques involved in big data text mining and analysis are challenging for public health data analysts to apply. This study proposes and explores the feasibility of a novel yet straightforward method by regressing the outcome of interest on the aggregated influence scores for association and/or classification analyses based on generalized linear models. The method reduces the document term matrix by transforming text data into a continuous summary score, thereby reducing the data dimension substantially and easing the data sparsity issue of the term matrix. To illustrate the proposed method in detailed steps, we used three Twitter datasets on various topics: autism spectrum disorder, influenza, and violence against women. We found that our results were generally consistent with the critical factors associated with the specific public health topic in the existing literature. The proposed method could also classify tweets into different topic groups appropriately with consistent performance compared with existing text mining methods for automatic classification based on tweet contents.

TI  - Prevalence of questionable health behaviours in Serbia and their psychological roots: protocol for a nationally representative survey
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionWe will launch a national survey in Serbia to document the prevalence of two types of questionable health behaviours: (1) intentional non-adherence to medical recommendations and (2) use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine practices, as well as the relation between the two. We will also investigate their psychological roots, including (a) 'distal' predictors such as HEXACO personality traits (plus Disintegration) and thinking dispositions (rational/experiential thinking and cognitive reflexivity), and (b) 'proximal' predictors under the umbrella 'irrational mindset' (set of unfounded beliefs consisting of conspiratorial thinking, superstition, magical health beliefs as well as selected cognitive biases), which have more content-wise overlap with the health behaviours.Methods and analysisIn this cross-sectional study, a research agency will collect data from a nationally representative sample (n=1043; age 18-75 years; estimated start/end-June/November 2021) recruited online (approximately, 70% of the sample, aged 18-54; 11 years) and face-to-face (approximately, 30% of the sample, aged 55-75 years). Participants will complete a battery of tests assessing questionable health behaviours, basic personality traits, thinking dispositions, irrational mindset, sociopolitical beliefs, sociodemographic and health-related variables. Prevalence rates will be calculated using descriptive statistics. To explore the relation between (psychological) predictors and questionable health behaviours, we will use hierarchical regression and partial mediation models (path analysis or full SEM models).Ethics and disseminationEthical Committees of the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade (#935/1), Faculty of Special Education and Rehabilitation (#139/1) and Faculty of Media and Communications (#228) approved the protocol. Only participants who provide informed consent will participate in the study. A research report based on the study results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and results will be made available to stakeholders through reports on the project website https://reasonforhealth.f.bg.ac.rs/en/ and disseminated via social media.Trial registration numberNCT05808660

TI  - Linking coastal environmental and health observations for human wellbeing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Coastal areas have long been attractive places to live, work, and recreate and remain so even in the face of growing threats from global environmental change. At any moment, a significant portion of the human population is exposed to both positive and negative health effects associated with coastal locations. Some locations may be "hotspots" of concern for human health due to ongoing climatic and other changes, accentuating the need for better understanding of coastal environment-human health linkages. This paper describes how environmental and health data could be combined to create a coastal environmental and human health observing system. While largely based on information from the US and Europe, the concept should be relevant to almost any coastal area. If implemented, a coastal health observing system would connect a variety of human health data and environmental observations for individuals and communities, and where possible cohorts. Health data would be derived from questionnaires and other personal sources, clinical examinations, electronic health records, wearable devices, and syndromic surveillance, plus information on vulnerability and health-relevant community characteristics, and social media observations. Environmental data sources would include weather and climate, beach and coastal conditions, sentinel species, occurrences of harmful organisms and substances, seafood safety advisories, and distribution, proximity, and characteristics of health-promoting green and blue spaces. Where available, information on supporting resources could be added. Establishment of a linked network of coastal health observatories could provide powerful tools for understanding the positive and negative health effects of coastal living, lead to better health protections and enhanced wellbeing, and provide significant benefits to coastal residents, including the historically disadvantaged, as well as the military, hospitals and emergency departments, academic medical, public health, and environmental health programs, and others. Early networks could provide best practices and lessons learned to assist later entries.

TI  - Identifying and addressing conflicting results across multiple discordant systematic reviews on the same question: protocol for a replication study of the Jadad algorithm
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction An increasing growth of systematic reviews (SRs) presents notable challenges for decision-makers seeking to answer clinical questions. In 1997, an algorithm was created by Jadad to assess discordance in results across SRs on the same question. Our study aims to (1) replicate assessments done in a sample of studies using the Jadad algorithm to determine if the same SR would have been chosen, (2) evaluate the Jadad algorithm in terms of utility, efficiency and comprehensiveness, and (3) describe how authors address discordance in results across multiple SRs. Methods and analysis We will use a database of 1218 overviews (2000-2020) created from a bibliometric study as the basis of our search for studies assessing discordance (called discordant reviews). This bibliometric study searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Epistemonikos and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for overviews. We will include any study using Jadad (1997) or another method to assess discordance. The first 30 studies screened at the full-text stage by two independent reviewers will be included. We will replicate the authors' Jadad assessments. We will compare our outcomes qualitatively and evaluate the differences between our Jadad assessment of discordance and the authors' assessment. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval was required as no human subjects were involved. In addition to publishing in an open-access journal, we will disseminate evidence summaries through formal and informal conferences, academic websites, and across social media platforms. This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate and replicate Jadad algorithm assessments of discordance across multiple SRs.

TI  - Suicide mortality in the city of Sao Paulo: epidemiological characteristics and their social factors in a temporal trend between 2000 and 2017. Retrospective study
T2  - SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for one million deaths annually. Greater understanding of the causal risk factors is needed, especially in large urban centers.
   OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the epidemiological profile and temporal trend of suicides over two decades and correlate prevalence with social indicators.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive population-based longitudinal retrospective study conducted in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   METHODS: A temporal trend series for suicide mortality in this city was constructed based on data from the Ministry of Health's mortality notification system, covering 2000-2017. It was analyzed using classic demographic variables relating to social factors.
   RESULTS: Suicide rates were high throughout this period, increasing from 4.6/100,000 inhabitants in the 2000s to 4.9/100,000 in 2017 (mean: 4.7/100,000). The increase in mortality was mainly due to increased male suicide, which went from 6.0/100,000 to the current 8.0/100,000. Other higher coefficients corresponded to social risk factors, such as being a young adult (25-44 years old), being more educated (eight years of schooling) and having white ethnicity (67.2%). Suicide was also twice as likely to occur at home (47.8%).
   CONCLUSION: High suicide rates were seen over the period 2000-2017, especially among young adults and males. High schooling levels and white ethnicity were risk factors. The home environment is the crucial arena for preventive action. One special aspect of primary prevention is the internet and especially social media, which provides a multitude of information for suicide prevention.

TI  - Digital Epidemiological Approaches in HIV Research: a Scoping Methodological Review
T2  - CURRENT HIV/AIDS REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this scoping review was to summarize literature regarding the use of user-generated digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research.Recent FindingsThirty-nine papers were included in the final review. Four types of digital data were used: social media data, web search queries, mobile phone data, and data from global positioning system (GPS) devices. With these data, four HIV epidemiological objectives were pursued, including disease surveillance, behavioral surveillance, assessment of public attention to HIV, and characterization of risk contexts. Approximately one-third used machine learning for classification, prediction, or topic modeling. Less than a quarter discussed the ethics of using user-generated data for epidemiological purposes.SummaryUser-generated digital data can be used to monitor, predict, and contextualize HIV risk and can help disrupt trajectories of risk closer to onset. However, more attention needs to be paid to digital ethics and the direction of the field in a post-Application Programming Interface (API) world.

TI  - Increase in incidence of anorexia nervosa among 10-to 14-year-old girls: A nationwide study in the Netherlands over four decades
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
AB  - ObjectiveThis primary care study examined time trends in the incidence of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) in the Netherlands across four decades.MethodsA nationwide network of general practitioners, serving approximately 1% of the total Dutch population, recorded newly diagnosed patients with AN and BN in their practices from 1985 to 2019 (2,890,978 person-years). DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were consistently used and the same psychiatrist was responsible for the final diagnostic decision. Incidence rates (IRs) were calculated for: the total population (all ages), females overall, and females per 5-year age category. Time trends in IRs were analyzed using JoinPoint regression analyses.ResultsIn four decades, the incidence of AN among 10- to 14-year-old females increased significantly from 8.6 to 38.6 per 100,000 person-years (average period percentage change [APPC] = 56.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.5-130.6. The overall incidence of AN was stable, with IRs ranging from 6.0 (95% CI = 4.3-8.1) to 8.4 (95% CI = 6.4-10.8). The IR of BN decreased significantly from 8.7 (95% CI = 6.7-11.0) to 3.2 (95% CI = 2.0-4.9) in the 2000s, before leveling off in the 2010s (IR 3.2; 95% CI = 2.0-4.8).DiscussionThe incidence of AN among 10- to 14-year-old girls increased significantly over four decades. Both biological and sociocultural factors, for example, early pubertal timing and the impact of social media, might explain this. In other age groups and overall, the incidence of AN remained stable. The significant decrease of the incidence of BN in the previous decades halted in the last decade.Public SignificanceAn important finding of the present study is that for 10- to 14-year-old girls, the risk for developing anorexia nervosa has increased significantly over 40 years. More healthcare facilities for younger people are needed, and prevention programs could include social media use. For bulimia nervosa, the general decrease in the occurrence of new cases has halted in the 2010s.

TI  - Associations between digital media use and psychotic experiences in young adults of Quebec, Canada: a longitudinal study
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - PurposeDigital media use has been associated with psychotic experiences in youth from the community, but the direction of association remains unclear. We aimed to examine between- and within-person associations of digital media use and psychotic experiences in youth.MethodsThe sample included 425 participants aged 18-25 years (82.5% female) from the community, followed between May 2021 and January 2022 over 3 time points-of which 263 participants (61.9%) completed at least 2. Digital media use was self-reported as time spent daily on TV and streaming platforms, social media, and video games over the past 3 months. Psychotic experiences in the past 3 months were measured with the 15-item Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences. Associations between digital media use and psychotic experiences were estimated using a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model.ResultsOn average, individuals who reported greater digital media use also reported higher levels of psychotic experiences (r = 0.34, 95% CI 0.15, 0.53). However, a person's variation in digital media use, relative to their personal average, was not significantly associated with subsequent variations in their levels of psychotic experiences, or vice-versa. Results were similar across TV/streaming, social media and video game use, and after adjusting for age, sex, education, sleep, physical activity, and cannabis use.ConclusionIndividuals with a tendency for higher levels of digital media use also had a tendency for higher levels of psychotic experiences. Understanding this association may help personalize mental health interventions for people with psychotic experiences, which may be offered digitally to promote their accessibility.

TI  - Respiratory function and respiratory complications in spinal cord injury: protocol for a prospective, multicentre cohort study in high-income countries
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Pneumonia is one of the leading complications and causes of death after a spinal cord injury (SCI). After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI.
   Methods and analysis RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by all local ethics committees of all participating centres. Study results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, to the SCI community, other stakeholders and via social media, newsletters and engagement activities.

TI  - Perceptions of cervical cancer prevention on Twitter uncovered by different sampling strategies
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Introduction
   Cervical cancer prevention is possible through use of the HPV vaccine and Pap tests, yet the vaccine remains underutilized.
   Methods
   We obtained publicly-available Twitter data from 2014 using three sampling strategies (top-ranked, simple random sample, and topic model) based on key words related to cervical cancer prevention. We conducted a content analysis of 100 tweets from each of the three samples and examined the extent to which the narratives and frequency of themes differed across samples.
   Results
   Advocacy-related tweets constituted the most prevalent theme to emerge across all three sample types, and were most frequently found in the top-ranked sample. A random sample detected the same themes as topic modeling, but the relative frequency of themes identified from topic modeling fell in-between top-ranked and random samples.
   Discussion
   Variations in themes uncovered by different sampling methods suggest it is useful to qualitatively assess the relative frequency of themes to better understand the breadth and depth of social media conversations about health.
   Conclusions
   Future studies using social media data should consider sampling methods to uncover a wider breadth of conversations about health on social media.

TI  - Multidisciplinary collaboration among young specialists: results of an international survey by the emerging EULAR network and other young organisations
T2  - RMD OPEN
AB  - Background Multidisciplinary collaboration is defined as a collective work involving multiple disciplines and is common in clinical care and research. Our aim was to describe current clinical and research collaboration among young specialists and to identify unmet needs in this area. Methods An online survey was disseminated by email and social media to members of the EMerging EUlar NETwork, the Young Nephrologists' Platform, the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society Emerging Rheumatologists and Researchers and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Junior Members. Results Of 303 respondents from 36 countries, 61% were female, 21% were aged below 30 years and 67% were aged 31-40 years. Young rheumatologists were the most represented (39%), followed by young nephrologists (24%), young paediatricians (20%), young allergologists (11%) then young internists (3%) and 3% other specialities. Collaborations were reported frequently by phone and email, also by various combined clinics while common local multidisciplinary meetings were uncommon. 96% would like to develop clinical research collaborations and 69% basic research collaborations. The majority of young specialists would be interested in online (84%) and/or 1-2 days (85%) common courses including case discussion (81%) and training workshops (85%), as well as webinars recorded with several specialists on a specific disease (96%). Conclusions This collaborative initiative highlighted wishes from young specialists for developing (1) regular local multidisciplinary meetings to discuss complex patients, (2) clinical research collaboration with combined grants and (3) multidisciplinary online projects such as common courses, webinars and apps.

TI  - Development of a Lexicon for Pain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Pain has been an area of growing interest in the past decade and is known to be associated with mental health issues. Due to the ambiguous nature of how pain is described in text, it presents a unique natural language processing (NLP) challenge. Understanding how pain is described in text and utilizing this knowledge to improve NLP tasks would be of substantial clinical importance. Not much work has previously been done in this space. For this reason, and in order to develop an English lexicon for use in NLP applications, an exploration of pain concepts within free text was conducted. The exploratory text sources included two hospital databases, a social media platform (Twitter), and an online community (Reddit). This exploration helped select appropriate sources and inform the construction of a pain lexicon. The terms within the final lexicon were derived from three sources-literature, ontologies, and word embedding models. This lexicon was validated by two clinicians as well as compared to an existing 26-term pain sub-ontology and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. The final validated lexicon consists of 382 terms and will be used in downstream NLP tasks by helping select appropriate pain-related documents from electronic health record (EHR) databases, as well as pre-annotating these words to help in development of an NLP application for classification of mentions of pain within the documents. The lexicon and the code used to generate the embedding models have been made publicly available.

TI  - Foundations and Modeling of Dynamic Networks Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks: A Survey
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social network analysis, recommender systems and epidemiology. Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the proposed terminology.

TI  - Early-onset smoking and vaping of cannabis: Prevalence, correlates and trends in New Zealand 14-15-year-olds
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
AB  - Introduction: Initiating cannabis use at an early age elevates risk of harm. Cannabis vaping is an emerging issue, and it is unknown whether the patterning and correlates of early-onset cannabis vaping differ from those of cannabis smoking.Methods: We used repeat cross-sectional data from a nationally representative biennial survey (2012-2018) of students aged 14-15 years in New Zealand (N = 11,405), response rate 65% (2012), 64% (2014-2016) and 59% (2018).Results: Between 2012 and 2018 lifetime cannabis use decreased, but regular use (past month, weekly, daily) was stable. Prevalence of past month, weekly and daily use in 2016-2018 (pooled) was 8.6%, 3.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Cannabis vaping was reported by 24% of past month cannabis users. The demographic profile of early-onset cannabis smokers and vapers was similar, with elevated use of both modes among Maori (Indigenous), same- or both-sex attracted students and those in low decile (high-deprivation) schools. Correlates were similar for both modes. Cannabis use was strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol use. The next strongest associations (after adjustment) were exposure to second-hand smoke at home, student income >$50/week and low parental monitoring of whereabouts. Past week social media use, psychological distress and low parental monitoring of spending were also associated with both modes.Discussion and conclusions: Early-onset cannabis use is much higher in structurally disadvantaged groups, and among those who use tobacco and alcohol. Comprehensive multisubstance approaches to prevention are indicated in this age group. Efforts to reduce socio-economic inequity and exposure to other risk factors may reduce cannabis-related harm.

TI  - The role of science communication and academic health advocacy in improving population oral health and tackling inequalities
T2  - COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Oral conditions are a public health problem globally and stark oral health inequalities exist between and within countries. Yet, oral diseases are rarely considered as a health priority and evidence-informed policy generation is challenging. Science communication and health advocacy are critical in that respect. However, due to time limitations, research workload and other factors, academics are usually hindered from participating in such lengthy endeavours. Here, we make the case that 'science communication and health advocacy task forces' should be a priority at academic institutions. The two main duties of these task forces are knowledge transfer about the burden of oral conditions and patterns of inequalities, and their underlying social and commercial determinants, and advocacy and mediation between the stakeholders involved directly or indirectly in policy making. These interdisciplinary task forces, including both academics and non-academics, should collectively have skills that include (1) knowledge about oral health, dental public health and epidemiology, (2) ability to communicate clearly and coherently and make the case in both lay and scientific language terms, (3) familiarity with digital and social media platforms and ability to create visual aids, videos and documentaries, (4) good negotiation skills and (5) maintaining scientific transparency and avoiding getting involved in confrontation with political parties. In the current context, the role of the academic institutions should not only be the production of knowledge, but also the active transferability and application of this knowledge towards public benefit.

TI  - Spatiotemporal data mining: a survey on challenges and open problems
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB  - Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) discovers useful patterns from the dynamic interplay between space and time. Several available surveys capture STDM advances and report a wealth of important progress in this field. However, STDM challenges and problems are not thoroughly discussed and presented in articles of their own. We attempt to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive literature survey on state-of-the-art advances in STDM. We describe the challenging issues and their causes and open gaps of multiple STDM directions and aspects. Specifically, we investigate the challenging issues in regards to spatiotemporal relationships, interdisciplinarity, discretisation, and data characteristics. Moreover, we discuss the limitations in the literature and open research problems related to spatiotemporal data representations, modelling and visualisation, and comprehensiveness of approaches. We explain issues related to STDM tasks of classification, clustering, hotspot detection, association and pattern mining, outlier detection, visualisation, visual analytics, and computer vision tasks. We also highlight STDM issues related to multiple applications including crime and public safety, traffic and transportation, earth and environment monitoring, epidemiology, social media, and Internet of Things.

TI  - Biosafety at Home: How to Translate Biomedical Laboratory Safety Precautions for Everyday Use in the Context of COVID-19
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Population adoption of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic is at times deficient, increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Healthcare workers and those living in areas of intense transmission may benefit from implementing biosafety measures in their daily lives. A mixed-methods approach, combining components of single negotiation text and the Delphi method, was used to create a COVID-19 biosafety-at-home protocol. A consensus building coordinator liaised with 12 experts to develop the protocol over 11 iterations. Experts had more than 200 years of combined experience in epidemiology, virology, infectious disease prevention, and public health. A flyer, created from the final protocol, was professionally designed and initially distributed via social media and institutional websites/emails in Ecuador beginning on May 2, 2020. Since then, it has been distributed in other countries, reaching similar to 7,000 people. Translating research laboratory biosafety measures for the home/street environment might be challenging. The biosafety-at-home flyer addresses this challenge in a user-friendly format.

TI  - Mental health implications of COVID-19 pandemic and its response in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Introduction: Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a backseat when the limited resources are geared for pandemic containment. In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. Objectives: In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, 'mental health', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled.
   Results: The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India.
   Conclusion: Keeping a positive approach, developing vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most vulnerable.

TI  - Losing ground at the wrong time: trends in self-reported influenza vaccination uptake in Switzerland, Swiss Health Survey 2007-2017
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged >= 65 years. Design Three cross-sectional surveys. Participants Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged >= 65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the >= 65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease. Conclusion Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the influenza season 2020/2021 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media.

TI  - Mental Health and the Field Research Team
T2  - ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Due to the intellectual, physical, and emotional demands of field research, those doing this work need to strategies to monitor and maintain their own mental health before, during, and after a field season. Moreover, they should have a framework for supporting their colleagues. This review article will present a framework for assessing the mental health hazards and the reactions, both positive and negative, to fieldwork. First, it will use U.S. epidemiology to show that most field teams are at risk. Second, it will frame the field season both as a workplace and wilderness exposure event and discuss the elements of the field research environment that can be therapeutic for some but toxic for others. Third, it will discuss the psychological impacts of travel and reintegration as they are pertinent to the practice of archaeology. Research will be presented in order to guide evidence-informed policies for the field research team to improve the mental-health readiness and resiliency of the research team. Last, it will provide guidance on how to manage the anxiety caused by separating from social media platforms.

TI  - Loddon Mallee healthcare worker COVID-19 study-protocol for a prospective cohort study examining the health and well-being of rural Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is creating immense psychosocial disturbance. While global, broad-based research is being conducted, little is known about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and well-being or how protective and resilience factors influence the human response in Australian rural and regional communities. Rural and regional communities often have less resources to deal with such public health emergencies and face additional environmental adversity. Healthcare workers, including those in rural and regional areas, have felt the immediate impacts of COVID-19 in a multitude of ways and these impacts will continue for years to come. Therefore, this study aims to describe and understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rural and regional healthcare workforce within the Loddon Mallee region, Victoria, Australia. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort of rural and regional healthcare workers will be recruited and followed over 3 years to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health and well-being. Self-administered online questionnaires will be administered every 6 months for a 36-month period. Multiple outcomes will be assessed; however, the primary outcomes are emotional health and well-being and psychological resilience. Emotional health and well-being will be measured using validated instruments that will assess multiple domains of the emotional health and well-being continuum. Linear and logistic regression and latent growth curve modelling will be used to examine the association between baseline and follow-up participant emotional health, well-being and resilience while adjusting for potentially time-varying confounding variables. Participant characteristics measured at baseline will also be tested for association with incident health, morbidity, mortality and health service utilisation outcomes at follow-up. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained through the Bendigo Health Human Research Ethics Committee. The study findings will be disseminated through international conferences, international peer-reviewed journals and social media.

TI  - Disease Tracking in GCC Region Using Arabic Language Tweets
T2  - COMPANION PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE 2018 (WWW 2018)
CP  - 27th World Wide Web (WWW) Conference
AB  - Several prior studies have demonstrated the possibility of tracking the outbreak and spread of diseases using public tweets and other social media platforms. However, almost all such prior studies were restricted to geographically filtered English language tweets only. This study is the first to attempt a similar approach for Arabic language tweets originating from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. We obtained a list of commonly occurring diseases in the region from the Saudi Ministry of Health. We used both the English disease names as well as their Arabic translations to filter the stream of tweets. We acquired old tweets for a period spanning 29 months. All tweets were geographically filtered for the Middle East and the list of disease names in both English and Arabic languages. We observed that only a small fraction of tweets were in English, demonstrating that prior approaches to disease tracking relying on English language features are less effective for this region. We also demonstrate how Arabic language tweets can be used rather effectively to track the spread of some infectious diseases in the region. We verified our approach by demonstrating that a high degree of correlation between the occurrence of MERS-Coronavirus cases and Arabic language tweets on the disease. We also show that infectious diseases generating fewer tweets and noninfectious diseases do not exhibit the same high correlation. We also verify the usefulness of tracking cases using Twitter mentions by comparing against a ground truth data set of MERS-CoV cases obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health.

TI  - HIV testing behaviour and associated factors in men who have sex with men by level of urbanisation: a cross-sectional study in the Netherlands
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Regular HIV testing in men who have sex with men (MSM) enables timely entry into care and reduces the likelihood of HIV transmission. We aimed to assess HIV-testing behaviour and associated factors in MSM by urbanisation of place of residence. Design Data were derived from online survey ('Men & Sexuality') in the Netherlands, which was mainly advertised on social media (Facebook and Instagram), dating websites, apps for MSM (Grindr and PlanetRomeo) and gay media. Primary and secondary outcome measures HIV testing was defined as recent (<1 year), not recent (>= 1 year) or never. Using multinominal regression analyses, factors associated with not recent testing and never testing, compared with recent testing, were assessed among MSM living in highly (>2500 residences/km(2)) or non-highly (<= 2500 residences/km(2)) urbanised areas. Participants The study sample included 3815 MSM, currently living in the Netherlands. The mean age was 36 years (SD 14.7), and 67.6% were highly educated. Results In highly urbanised areas, 11.8% was never and 19.8% was not recently HIV-tested. In non-highly urbanised areas, this was 25.2% and 19.6%. Among MSM living in highly urbanised areas, independently associated with never and not recent testing were younger age, self-identification as bisexual, fewer sex partners, never notified of HIV and no recent condomless anal intercourse. Among MSM living in non-highly urbanised areas, lower perceived HIV severity, higher perceived HIV risk and a lower proportion gay friends were associated with never and not recent testing. Among never tested MSM, those in non-highly urbanised areas preferred self-sampling/self-testing over facility-based testing; those in highly urbanised areas preferred testing at healthcare facilities. Conclusions The proportion of never tested MSM was high (25%) in non-highly urbanised areas in the Netherlands. MSM living in non-highly urbanised areas may possibly be reached with targeted approaches to increase HIV testing uptake such as self-testing/self-sampling strategies.

TI  - Community knowledge, perceptions and practices around COVID-19 in Sierra Leone: a nationwide, cross-sectional survey
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives To assess the public's knowledge, attitudes and practices about the novel coronavirus in Sierra Leone to inform an evidence-based communication strategy around COVID-19. Design Nationwide, cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey. Setting 56 randomly selected communities in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone. Participants 1253 adults aged 18 years and older of which 52% were men. Main outcome measures We calculated proportions of core indicators (awareness, knowledge, risk perception, practices). A composite variable for knowledge (based on seven variables) was created, and categorised into low (0-2 correct), medium (3-4) and high (5-7). Predictors of knowledge were analysed with multilevel ordinal regression models. Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression models. Results We found that 75% of the respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A majority (70%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared with 61% of men. 60% of men and 54% of women had already taken action to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap and water (87%). Radio (73%) was the most used source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (39%). Having a medium or high level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.3). Conclusions This study shows that in the context of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, there is a strong association between knowledge and practices. Because the knowledge gap differs between genders, regions, educational levels and age, it is important that messages are specifically targeted to these core audiences.

TI  - Study protocol of a population-based cohort investigating Physical Activity, Sedentarism, lifestyles and Obesity in Spanish youth: the PASOS study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Physical activity (PA) is essential to healthy mental and physical development in early life. However, the prevalence of physical inactivity, which is considered a key modifiable driver of childhood obesity, has reached alarming levels among European youth. There is a need to update the data for Spain, in order to establish if current measures are effective or new approaches are needed.
   Methods and analysis We present the protocol for Physical Activity, Sedentarism, lifestyles and Obesity in Spanish youth (PASOS). This observational, nationally representative, multicentre study aims to determine the PA levels, sedentary behaviours and prevalence of physical inactivity (defined as <60 min of moderate to vigorous PA per day) in a representative sample of Spanish children and adolescents. The PASOS study has recruited a representative random sample of children and adolescents aged 8-16 years from 242 educational centres in the 17 'autonomous regions' into which Spain is divided. The aim is to include a total of 4508 youth participants and their families. Weight, height and waist circumference will be measured by standardised procedures. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, quality of life, sleep duration, PA and sedentary behaviour are being measured by validated questionnaires. PA is measured by the Physical Activity Unit 7-item Screener. A representative subsample (10% of participants) was randomly selected to wear accelerometers for 9 days to obtain objective data on PA. Parents are asked about their educational level, time spent doing PA, diet quality, self-perceived stress, smoking habit, weight, height, their child's birth weight and if the child was breast fed.
   Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fundacio Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain. Main findings of the study will be disseminated to the scientific community and to general public by media conferences, social media and a website.

TI  - Dizziness in Saudi Arabia: An epidemiologic study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - IntroductionDizziness is one of the most common and recurring complaints in adults presenting at the clinic. However, its prevalence in the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains unclear. We aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of dizziness in a large sample of the Saudi population. MethodsIn this is cross-sectional study, we used an electronic survey, which was completed by 1.478 respondents, with a response rate of 84% across five regions of Saudi Arabia. The online survey was launched on the Qualtrics website and distributed via social media channels to obtain heterogeneous responses. The study included adults aged >= 18 years who resided in Saudi Arabia during data collection. We used t-test and chi-square test for descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression model to assess prevalence and predictors of dizziness. ResultsMore than half of the participants were aged between 26 years and 45 years (58.66%). Of the participants, 42.97% reported having dizziness at the time of taking the survey. Women were less likely than men to report dizziness (OR = 0.65; CI, 0.49, 0.87; p = 0.003). A description of the type of dizziness by age revealed that vertigo slightly decreased with age. Unclear vision with movement or blurry vision was common in young adults, whereas imbalance was common in older adults. A multiple regression model adjusted for demographic characteristics revealed a statistically significant association between dizziness and age group. Participants in the age group of 46-55 years were 1.83 times more likely to report dizziness compared to those aged >65 years (odds ratio = 1.83; confidence interval, 0.62, 5.41; p = 0.0009). DiscussionDizziness is a common complaint in Saudi Arabia. Future studies should elucidate the risk factors for and mechanisms of dizziness to help prevent falls and reduced quality of life.

TI  - Air Pollution, housing and respirfatory tract Infections in Children: NatIonal birth Cohort study (PICNIC): study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction
   Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common reason for hospital admission among children Methods and analysis
   The aim of the PICNIC study (Air Pollution, housing and respiratory tract Infections in Children: NatIonal birth Cohort Study) is to quantify the extent to which in-utero, infant and childhood exposures to ambient air pollution and adverse housing conditions are associated with risk of RTI admissions in children <5 years old. We will use national administrative data birth cohorts, including data from all children born in England in 2005-2014 and in Scotland in 1997-2020, created via linkage between civil registration, maternity and hospital admission data sets. We will further enhance these cohorts via linkage to census data on housing conditions and socioeconomic position and small area-level data on ambient air pollution and building characteristics. We will use time-to-event analyses to examine the association between air pollution, housing characteristics and the risk of RTI admissions in children, calculate population attributable fractions for ambient air pollution and housing characteristics, and use causal mediation analyses to explore the mechanisms through which housing and air pollution influence the risk of infant RTI admission.
   Ethics, expected impact and dissemination
   To date, we have obtained approval from six ethics and information governance committees in England and two in Scotland. Our results will inform parents, national and local governments, the National Health Service and voluntary sector organisations of the relative contribution of adverse housing conditions and air pollution to RTI admissions in young children. We will publish our results in open-access journals and present our results to the public via parent groups and social media and on the PICNIC website. Code and metadata will be published on GitHub.

TI  - Serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 following non-hospitalised infection: clinical and ethnodemographic features associated with the magnitude of the antibody response
T2  - BMJ OPEN RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
AB  - Objective To determine clinical and ethnodemographic correlates of serological responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein following mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
   Design A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had self-isolated due to COVID-19.
   Setting University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK (UHBFT).
   Participants 956 healthcare workers were recruited by open invitation via UHBFT trust email and social media between 27 April 2020 and the 8 June 2020.
   Intervention Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of their original illness and ethnodemographic variables.
   Results Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG, IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2% (n=442/956). The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3%, 18.7% and 8.1% for IgG, IgA and IgM, respectively. IgGAM identified serological responses in 40.6% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a positive predictive value of 92.3% for seropositivity in self-isolating individuals a time when Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 was predominant.
   Conclusions and relevance Assays employing combined antibody detection demonstrate enhanced seroepidemiological sensitivity and can detect prior viral exposure even when PCR swabs have been negative. We demonstrate an association between known ethnodemographic risk factors associated with mortality from COVID-19 and the magnitude of serological responses in mild-to-moderate disease.

TI  - The role of artificial neural network and machine learning in utilizing spatial information
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
AB  - In this age of the fourth industrial revolution 4.0, the digital world has a plethora of data, including the internet of things, mobile, cybersecurity, social media, forecasts, health data, and so on. The expertise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is required to soundly evaluate the data and develop related smart and automated applications, These fields use a variety of machine learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The objective of the study is to present the role of artificial neural networks and machine learning in utilizing spatial information. Machine learning and AI play an increasingly important role in disaster risk reduction from hazard mapping and forecasting severe occurrences to real-time event detection, situational awareness, and decision assistance. Some of the applications employed in the study to analyze the various ANN domains included weather forecasting, medical diagnosis, aerospace, facial recognition, stock market, social media, signature verification, forensics, robotics, electronics hardware, defense, and seismic data gathering. Machine learning determines the many prediction models for problems involving classification, regression, and clustering using known variables and locations from the training dataset, spatial data that is based on tabular data creates different observations that are geographically related to one another for unknown factors and places. The study presents that the Recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network are the best method in spatial information processing, healthcare, and weather forecasting with greater than 90% accuracy.

TI  - Analysis of Tweets Containing Information Related to Rheumatological Diseases on Twitter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Tweets often indicate the interests of Twitter users. Data from Twitter could be used to better understand the interest in and perceptions of a variety of diseases and medical conditions, including rheumatological diseases which have increased in prevalence over the past several decades. The aim of this study was to perform a content analysis of tweets referring to rheumatological diseases. Methods: The content of each tweet was rated as medical (including a reference to diagnosis, treatment, or other aspects of the disease) or non-medical (such as requesting help). The type of user and the suitability of the medical content (appropriate content or, on the contrary, fake content if it was medically inappropriate according to the current medical knowledge) were also evaluated. The number of retweets and likes generated were also investigated. Results: We analyzed a total of 1514 tweets: 1093 classified as medical and 421 as non-medical. The diseases with more tweets were the most prevalent. Within the medical tweets, the content of these varied according to the disease (some more focused on diagnosis and others on treatment). The fake content came from unidentified users and mostly referred to the treatment of diseases. Conclusions: According to our results, the analysis of content posted on Twitter in regard to rheumatological diseases may be useful for investigating the public's prevailing areas of interest, concerns and opinions. Thus, it could facilitate communication between health care professionals and patients, and ultimately improve the doctor-patient relationship. Due to the interest shown in medical issues it seems desirable to have healthcare institutions and healthcare workers involved in Twitter.

TI  - Deep Learning Techniques on Text Classification Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) In Social Healthcare Network: A Comprehensive Survey
T2  - ICSPC'21: 2021 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION (ICPSC)
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICPSC)
AB  - The social media is becoming an increasing trend for sharing the thoughts, ideas, opinions, etc. based on online reviews which generates a tremendous amount of unstructured data (ie. User posts). For processing those unstructured data supervised learning algorithms are preferred which helps for better performance optimization. Few years ago, Deep Learning (DL) techniques (ie. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)) models has become popular in healthcare applications by giving the rise in complicacy of the healthcare data. Deep Learning (DL) Techniques provides an effective and efficient model for data analysis by uncovering the masked patterns and find the meaningful information from the significant amount of health data whereas the traditional analytics does not able to produce within a stipulated period. Specifically, Deep Learning (DL) techniques consist of yielding good results by using the models of pattern recognition for social healthcare networks. The study of this paper focuses on by investigating the models of deep learning (DL) techniques applied to classify the text in social media healthcare networks. The main intention of this review provides an insight for training the data and to classify the text by analyzing and extracting the raw input and produce the output with the help of Natural language processing (NLP). Overall, the purpose of this review is to enhance the performance of the text classifier based on effectiveness to improve accuracy and text processing speed by using a suitable methodology in order produce the promising results in the future.

TI  - Associations between digital media use and lack of physical exercise among middle-school adolescents in Korea
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The reported effects of digital media overuse on physical activity among adolescents are inconsistent. This study examined the association between hours of digital media use and lack of moderate-intensity physical exercise (mPE) according to the type of digital media.METHODS: This study included 1,837 middle school students from the iCURE (Internet user Cohort for Unbiased Recognition of gaming disorder in Early Adolescence) study conducted in Korea. Hours spent using digital media were measured by self-reported daily usage time for Internet games, messengers, social media, and watching game streaming on weekdays. Lack of mPE was defined as performing a minimum of 30 minutes at a time less than twice weekly. Multivariable logistic regression analysis stratified by sex was performed.RESULTS: Among male students, the group with the highest hours of using either Internet games or watching game streaming was more likely to lack mPE than each non-user group. In contrast, among male students, the group using either messengers or social media had a higher rate of mPE compared to each non-user group. Female students showed no association between hours spent using Internet games, messengers, social media, or watching game streaming and a lack of mPE.CONCLUSIONS: Among male middle school students in Korea, the excessive use of Internet games or watching game streaming was associated with a lack of mPE. Thus, guidelines should be established regarding adolescent use of internet games and watching game streaming.

TI  - Elucidating a Silent Illness: Hepatitis B Knowledge Among Asian Individuals in an Urban Center
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Despite comprising less than 6% of the US population, Asian individuals make up more than half of the approximately 1.6 million chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the United States. The purpose of this investigation was to identify characteristics associated with HBV knowledge in this disproportionately affected population. Methods: A cross-sectional, multilingual survey study using convenience sampling was conducted in a Midwestern urban city to collect information on respondents' demographics, health care access, and HBV knowledge. Hepatitis B virus knowledge was categorized into epidemiology, natural history, transmission, and vaccination. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. Results: Of the 174 individuals who completed surveys, 139 (79.9%) were Asian. Characteristics of univariate analyses associated with higher knowledge scores included younger age (18-49 years), proficiency in reading English, college education, current employment status, physician using preferred language, last physician's visit in 2018 or prior, perceived lack of time to see a physician, use of emergency department, prior HBV vaccination, prior HBV testing, higher level of self-reported knowledge about HBV, and acquiring health information from the Internet, messaging applications, friends, and family (P < .05). In the multivariable analysis, shorter residency in the United States (0-10 years), current employment status, having heard of HBV, and confidence in their HBV knowledge were associated with higher knowledge scores. Conclusion: Knowledge deficits existed in our study population regarding HBV transmission, vaccination, and epidemiology, while knowledge was higher regarding HBV natural history. Education efforts should be designed to improve knowledge deficits about HBV for individuals with risk factors using culturally sensitive Internet and social media platforms.

TI  - A Decade of Tweets: Visualizing Racial Sentiments Towards Minoritized Groups in the United States Between 2011 and 2021
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background:Research has demonstrated the negative impact of racism on health, yet the measurement of racial sentiment remains challenging. This article provides practical guidance on using social media data for measuring public sentiment.Methods:We describe the main steps of such research, including data collection, data cleaning, binary sentiment analysis, and visualization of findings. We randomly sampled 55,844,310 publicly available tweets from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2021 using Twitter's Application Programming Interface. We restricted analyses to US tweets in English using one or more 90 race-related keywords. We used a Support Vector Machine, a supervised machine learning model, for sentiment analysis.Results:The proportion of tweets referencing racially minoritized groups that were negative increased at the county, state, and national levels, with a 16.5% increase at the national level from 2011 to 2021. Tweets referencing Black and Middle Eastern people consistently had the highest proportion of negative sentiment compared with all other groups. Stratifying temporal trends by racial and ethnic groups revealed unique patterns reflecting historical events specific to each group, such as the killing of George Floyd regarding sentiment of posts referencing Black people, discussions of the border crisis near the 2018 midterm elections and anti-Latinx sentiment, and the emergence of COVID-19 and anti-Asian sentiment.Conclusions:This study demonstrates the utility of social media data as a quantitative means to measure racial sentiment over time and place. This approach can be extended to a range of public health topics to investigate how changes in social and cultural norms impact behaviors and policy.A supplemental digital video is available at http://links.lww.com/EDE/C91Conclusions:This study demonstrates the utility of social media data as a quantitative means to measure racial sentiment over time and place.

TI  - Availability, access, analysis and dissemination of small-area data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - In this era of 'big data', there is growing recognition of the value of environmental, health, social and demographic data for research. Open government data initiatives are growing in number and in terms of content. Remote sensing data are finding widespread use in environmental research, including in low- and middle-income settings. While our ability to study environment and health associations across countries and continents grows, data protection rules and greater patient control over the use of their data present new challenges to using health data in research. Innovative tools that circumvent the need for the physical sharing of data by supporting non-disclosive sharing of information, or that permit spatial analysis without researchers needing access to underlying patient data can be used to support analyses while protecting data confidentiality. User-friendly visualizations, allowing small-area data to be seen and understood by non-expert audiences, are revolutionizing public and researcher interactions with data. The UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit's Environment and Health Atlas for England and Wales, and the US National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network offer good examples. Open data facilitates user-generated outputs, and 'mash-ups', and user-generated inputs from social media, mobile devices and wearable tech are new data streams that will find utility in future studies, and bring novel dimensions with respect to ethical use of small-area data.

TI  - Using multilevel regression with poststratification to obtain regional health estimates from a Facebook-recruited sample
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: We assess the effectiveness of multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) as a tool to mitigate selection bias from online surveys of small geographical regions.
   Methods: We collected self-reported health information from an Internet-based sample of adults residing within the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in 2017. We created Bayesian hierarchical models with three sets of predictor variables for each of six common health behaviors and outcomes, with results poststratified using the American Community Survey to estimate region and ZIP Code Tabulation Area -level prevalence.
   Results: When comparing MRP estimates with a population-based sample as a reference, we found that adjustment using MRP can reduce bias in prevalence estimates and provide estimates for local area prevalence. 14 of 18 adjusted estimates were closer to the benchmark than the unadjusted estimates and MRP using all three covariate sets resulted in better overall agreement with the benchmark compared with the unadjusted estimates.
   Conclusions: MRP can improve prevalence estimates from self-selected Internet-based samples, although a nonnegligible amount of bias may remain. Illustrating the utility and limitations of this method will help researchers develop relevant estimates of the local public health burden, helping local health officials better understand and reduce poor health outcomes.

TI  - Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease in Malaysia 2023: study protocol for a community-based nationwide cross-sectional survey
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardio-metabolic dysfunctions characterised by increased fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides and reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Meanwhile, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the new term for fatty liver associated with MetS. People with MetS or MAFLD have higher risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortalities. However, large-scale data on MetS and MAFLD prevalence in Malaysia is mainly unknown. This study aims to determine the prevalence of MetS and MAFLD among the general adult population in Malaysia.Methods and analysis This is a community-based nationwide cross-sectional study in Malaysia. The data collection period is from July 2023 until September 2023, with a planned sample size of 1296 participants. We use a two-stage proportionate stratified random sampling method to ensure national representativeness. The definition of MetS follows the Harmonised Joint Interim Statement in 2009. A diagnosis of MAFLD is made if a participant has fatty liver, defined as having a Fatty Liver Index >= 60 and has type 2 diabetes, a body mass index >= 23 kg/m(2), or >= 2 metabolic risk abnormalities. Complex sample analysis will be conducted, and the disease prevalence will be reported with 95% CIs, unweighted counts and estimated populations.Ethics and dissemination The protocol has been approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR ID-22-02845-GUT). The findings will be disseminated through a formal report, policy brief, scientific publications, conference presentations, social media, print media and stakeholder engagement activities.

TI  - Acetaminophen, antibiotics, ear infection, breastfeeding, vitamin D drops, and autism : an epidemiological study
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
AB  - Background: While many studies have examined environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), much of the research focus has been on prenatal or perinatal factors. Yet, the postnatal environment may affect the risk of ASD as well.
   Objective: To determine whether a set of five postnatal variables are associated with ASD. These variables are: acetaminophen exposure, antibiotic exposure, incidence of ear infection, decreased duration of breastfeeding, and decreased consumption of oral vitamin D drops.
   Materials and methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted. Participants were parents living in the USA with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years of age. Potential participants were informed about the survey via postings on social media, websites, and listservs and were offered an opportunity to participate in a raffle as well. Participants were also recruited through the Interactive Autism Network.
   Results: There were 1,741 completed survey responses. After exclusions, there remained 1,001 responses associated with children with ASD (cases) and 514 responses associated with children who do not have ASD (controls). In this data set, doses of postnatal acetaminophen (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.016, CI: 1.003-1.032, .0.026), courses of postnatal antibiotics (aOR 1.103, CI: 1.046-1.168, p<0.001), incidence of postnatal ear infection (aOR 1.137, Cl: 1.046-1 .236, p=0.003), and decreased duration of breastfeeding (aOR 0.948, CI: 0.932-0.965, p<0.001) are all associated with ASD when adjusted for eight demographic variables. A weak association between oral vitamin D drop exposure and ASD was also found when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics (aOR 1.025, CI: 0.995-1.056,p=0.102).
   Conclusion: This study adds to evidence that postnatal acetaminophen use, postnatal antibiotic use, incidence of ear infection, and early weaning are associated with an increased risk of ASD. It also finds that postnatal oral vitamin D drops are weakly associated with ASD when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics.

TI  - Mental health in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a nationally representative multilevel survey in Serbia
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a prolonged impact on mental health (MH); however, the long-term MH effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown. The Serbian national survey-CoV2Soul.RS-was launched to document the MH status of the Serbian population following the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute to an international evidence base about MH prevalence rates during different phases of the pandemic. Methods and analysis This cross-sectional study was designed to collect a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18-65 years; estimated start/end-June/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics. For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance and regression analyses. The hierarchical structure of the data will be explored using multilevel random coefficient modelling. Structural equation modelling will be used to investigate the indirect effects of personality on distress through relevant variables. Ethics and dissemination Ethical Committees of the Faculty of Medicine (1322-VII/31) and Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade (02-33/273) and Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad (05-27, br.893/1) approved the protocol. Only respondents able to provide informed consent will participate in the study. Research reports will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and the results will be placed on the website to be available to funders, researchers, policy-makers and interested laypeople, and will be advertised through social media.

TI  - Erectile dysfunction and prostate diseases are the predominant Google search terms amongst men's health topics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPOTENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Patients are becoming increasingly active consumers of health information on the internet with urologic concerns being no exception. Our objective was to explore online search trends for topics related to men's health and identify information-seeking patterns related to news and media coverage of these topics. We used Google Trends (http://google.com/trends) to explore search trends for various search terms related to men's health in the United States over a 5-year period. Search queries provided graphs depicting search volume as a function of time, geographical data, and related topics and queries. Isolated spikes in search volume were further explored to identify a related event. Erectile dysfunction was the most-searched topic over the last 5 years in the United States. Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia were the second and third most-searched topics, respectively. Other popular topics involved symptoms or pathologies of the testicles and penis. Most topics had relatively stable search volumes, with the exceptions of premature ejaculation and Peyronie's disease. Several observed spikes in search volume were attributable to singular events, mostly in the form of online article publications or social media posts. We believe it may be helpful for providers to stay informed of cultural events relating to medical conditions to anticipate patient concerns.

TI  - Protocol for EXICODE: the EXIstential health COhort DEnmark-a register and survey study of adult Danes
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction We established the EXIstential health COhort DEnmark (EXICODE) to examine how existential and spiritual needs, practices and orientations in a secular culture are linked to health outcomes, illness trajectory and overall cost of care in patients. Substantial literature demonstrates that existential and spiritual well-being has positive effects on health. While people turn to existential and spiritual orientations and practices during ageing, struggle with illness and approaching death, patients with severe illnesses like, for example, cancer similarly experience existential and spiritual needs. These needs are often unmet in secular societies leading to spiritual pain, unnecessary suffering, worse quality of life and higher medical costs of care. Methods and analysis EXICODE is a national cohort comprising a 10% random sample of the adult Danish population with individual-level register and survey data. Specific patient subgroups are oversampled to ensure diseased respondents. The questionnaire used in the survey consists of a collection of validated instruments on existential and spiritual constructs suited for secular culture as well as some ad hoc questions compiled in the comprehensive EXICODE Questionnaire. Ethics and dissemination The project is registered for legal and GDPR concerns by the University of Southern Denmark, journal number: 10.367. Ethical approval was not required by Danish law since EXICODE collects only interview, survey and register data, but due to institutional best-practice policy an ethical evaluation and approval were nevertheless obtained from the University of Southern Denmark Research Ethics Committee (institutional review board), journal number: 20/39546. The project follows The Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity and is carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Results will be disseminated widely through publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, international conferences, patient societies as well as mass and social media.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
AB  - Since January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) to be a public health emergency of international concern, the National Library of Medicine's (NLM's) Web Collecting and Archiving Working Group has been collecting a broad range of web-based content about the emerging pandemic for preservation in an Internet archive. Like NLM's other Global Health Events web collections, this content will have enduring value as a multifaceted historical record for future study and understanding of this event. This article describes the scope of the COVID-19 project; some of the content captured from websites, blogs, and social media; collecting criteria and methods; and related COVID-19 collecting efforts by other groups. The growing collection-2,500 items as of June 30, 2020-chronicles the many facets of the pandemic: epidemiology; vaccine and drug research; disease control measures and resistance to them; effects of the pandemic on health care institutions and workers, education, commerce, and many aspects of social life; effects for especially vulnerable groups; role of health disparities in infection and mortality; and recognition of racism as a public health emergency.

TI  - All pins are not created equal: communicating skin cancer visually on Pinterest
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Skin cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women younger than 39 years in the USA. As a female-oriented social media, Pinterest could be effectively used in reaching this particular demographic group for the purpose of skin cancer education. We analyze the visual characteristics of skin cancer pins, including use of human image, use of fear-invoking image, pin composition, color, and text legibility. We also explore how these visual characteristics as well as information richness predict Pinterest users' participative engagement. A combination of descriptive and predictive content analysis of 708 pins is conducted. The demographic characteristics of human models are consistent with epidemiology data. Text legibility in bodycopy is low. Information richness is a significant predictor of number of repins in all pins except pins on melanoma with human models. In the case of latter, pin composition, gender of human models, and fear-invoking images were associated with the number of repins. A number of visual characteristics as well as information richness significantly predict Pinterest users' participant engagement with pins on skin cancer. Public health professionals should consider these factors in creating effective prevention messages to be circulated on Pinterest.

TI  - The Need for Psychiatric Treatment among Polish Users of Psychoactive Substances Is Increasing: This and Other Results from the Newest PolDrugs Survey
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: PolDrugs is the largest Polish naturalistic nationwide survey to present basic demographic and epidemiological data that could potentially prevent harm from illicit substances intake in drugs users. The most recent results were presented in 2021. The goal of this year's edition was to re-present the above data and compare it to the previous edition's data to identify and describe the differences. Materials and Methods: The survey included original questions about basic demographics, substance use, and psychiatric treatment. The survey was administered via the Google Forms platform and promoted via social media. The data was collected from 1117 respondents. Results: People of all ages use a variety of psychoactive substances in many situations. The three most commonly used drugs are marijuana, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms. The most common reason for seeking professional medical help was amphetamine use. A total of 41.7 percent of respondents were receiving psychiatric treatment. The three most common psychiatric diagnoses among the respondents were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD. Conclusions: Key findings include increases in the use of psilocybin and DMT, increases in the use of heated tobacco products, and a near doubling in the percentage of individuals receiving psychiatric help in the past two years. These issues are discussed in the discussion section of this paper, which also addresses the limitations to the article.

TI  - Impact of smartphone overuse on 1-year severe depressive symptoms and momentary negative affect: Longitudinal and experience sampling findings from a representative epidemiological youth sample in Hong Kong
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - Smartphone overuse can have detrimental impacts on youth mental health. How it may be longitudinally associated with depressive symptoms and functioning, and with daily momentary affect, remains to be investigated. A total of 3,033 young people were consecutively recruited from a large-scale epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong Kong. A subsample (n = 936) was followed-up after 1 year, with experience sampling data collected from 177 participants. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were applied to examine the prospective associations between smartphone overuse and depressive symptoms, with multilevel models fitted to examine its associations with momentary affect. The prevalence of smartphone overuse in the Hong Kong youth population was 29.3%. Smartphone overuse was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms and functional impairments both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The associations between smartphone overuse and 1-year depressive symptoms were significant, even when accounting for baseline symptoms, social media use, and other risk and protective factors. Baseline depressive symptoms, in contrast, were not associated with 1-year smartphone overuse after adjusting for baseline smartphone overuse. Smartphone overuse was also significantly associated with higher levels of momentary negative affect, even when accounting for depressive symptoms. Strategies to mitigate the impact of smartphone overuse can have important long-term implications.

TI  - Self-reported symptoms from exposure to Covid-19 provide support to clinical diagnosis, triage and prognosis: An exploratory analysis
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Symptomatic COVID-19 is prevalent in the community. We identify factors indicating COVID-19 positivity in non-hospitalized patients and prognosticators of moderate-to-severe disease.
   Methods: Appeals conducted in April-June 2020 in social media, collaborating medical societies and patient advocacy groups recruited 20,476 participants >= 18 years who believed they had COVID-19 exposure. Volunteers consented on-line and reported height, weight, concomitant illnesses, medication and supplement use, residential, occupational or community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2279 reported a COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1414 negative (COVID-).
   Results: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever best distinguished COVID+ from COVID-participants (OR 6.07, 95% CI: 4.39 to 8.47). COVID + subjects with BMI>30, concomitant respiratory disorders or an organ transplant had increased risk of moderate-to- severe dyspnoea. Race and anti-autoimmunity medication did not affect moderate-to-severe dyspnea risk.
   Conclusions: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever differentiates COVID-19. Elevated risks of severe symptoms outside the hospital were most evident among the obese and those with pulmonary comorbidity. Race and use of medication for autoimmune disease did not predict severe disease. These findings should facilitate rapid COVID-19 diagnosis and triage in settings without testing.

TI  - Communication and Community Involvement to Support Risk Governance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - In past years, communication activities have become increasingly important in the environment and health domain, considering the concurrent developments of social media and scientific citizenship that contributed changes in legislation and culture. Communication is particularly crucial where an environmental hazard is present, as in the case of high risk environmental and health risk areas. The project "International Center of Advanced Study in Environment, Ecosystem and Human Health" (CISAS), carried out by the Italian National Research Council, covers multiple research activities, from ecology to biology and medical sciences, from epidemiology to social sciences and communication. Three different studies based on human biomonitoring and a birth cohort study are currently in progress in the project locations, together with studies on the environmental fate of pollutants. A clear, accurate and respectful communication of study protocols and results represents a priority to produce comprehensible information available for policy makers, citizens, and stakeholders. This paper describes the multiple external and internal communication activities planned in the framework of the CISAS project as an example of promotion of knowledge in the society at large and improvement of risk management in the environmental health domain.

TI  - Peer-reported bullying, rejection and hallucinatory experiences in childhood
T2  - ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Objective Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur commonly in children and have been related to bullying victimization. However, whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated with future hallucinatory experiences.
   Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates.
   Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50% higher, and bully-victims had a 89% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory experiences three years later than children who were not involved in bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim = 1.89, 95% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks, but not peer acceptance networks, were associated with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection = 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024).
   Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable for psychotic experiences.

TI  - Facilitating Adolescent Well-Being: A Review of the Challenges and Opportunities and the Beneficial Roles of Parents, Schools, Neighborhoods, and Policymakers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Adolescents face exceptional challenges and opportunities that may have a lifelong impact on their consumption and personal and societal well-being. Parents, community members (schools and neighborhoods), and policymakers play major roles in shaping adolescents and influencing their engagement in consumption behaviors that are either developmentally problematic (e.g., drug use and unhealthy eating) or developmentally constructive (e.g., academic pursuits and extracurricular activities). In this article, we discuss two main topics: (a) the challenges and opportunities that characterize adolescence, based primarily on research in epidemiology and neuroscience, and (b) the ways that parents, community members, and policymakers can facilitate positive adolescent development, based on research from many disciplines including marketing, psychology, sociology, communications, public health, and education. Our goal is to summarize the latest scientific findings that can be used by various stakeholders to help adolescents navigate this turbulent period and become well-adjusted, thriving adults.

TI  - Identifying COVID-19 Personal Health Mentions From Tweets Using Masked Attention Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Twitter has been an important platform for people to discuss and share health-related information. It provides a massive amount of data for real-time monitoring of infectious diseases (such as COVID-19) and freeing disease-prevention organizations from the tedious labor involved in public health surveillance. Personal health mention (PHM) detection is one of the critical methods to keep up-to-date on an epidemic's condition; it attempts to identify a person's health condition based on online text information. This paper explores PHM identification for COVID-19 through Twitter. We built a COVID-19 PHM data set containing tweets annotated with four types of COVID-19-related health conditions. A masked attention model was devised to classify the tweets as self-mention, other-mention, awareness, and non-health. We obtained promising results on the PHM identification task. The classification results facilitate timely health monitoring and surveillance for digital epidemiology. We also evaluate how the attention mechanism and training method affect the model's predictive performance.

TI  - Use of Network Analysis and Spread Models to Target Control Actions for Bovine Tuberculosis in a State from Brazil
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (similar to 94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.

TI  - Impact of mobile phones and wireless devices use on children and adolescents' mental health: a systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Growing use of mobiles phones (MP) and other wireless devices (WD) has raised concerns about their possible effects on children and adolescents' wellbeing. Understanding whether these technologies affect children and adolescents' mental health in positive or detrimental ways has become more urgent following further increase in use since the COVID-19 outbreak. To review the empirical evidence on associations between use of MP/WD and mental health in children and adolescents. A systematic review of literature was carried out on Medline, Embase and PsycINFO for studies published prior to July 15th 2019, PROSPERO ID: CRD42019146750. 25 observational studies published between January 1st 2011 and 2019 were reviewed (ten were cohort studies, 15 were cross-sectional). Overall estimated participant mean age and proportion female were 14.6 years and 47%, respectively. Substantial between-study heterogeneity in design and measurement of MP/WD usage and mental health outcomes limited our ability to infer general conclusions. Observed effects differed depending on time and type of MP/WD usage. We found suggestive but limited evidence that greater use of MP/WD may be associated with poorer mental health in children and adolescents. Risk of bias was rated as 'high' for 16 studies, 'moderate' for five studies and 'low' for four studies. More high-quality longitudinal studies and mechanistic research are needed to clarify the role of sleep and of type of MP/WD use (e.g. social media) on mental health trajectories in children and adolescents.

TI  - Belarusian Healthcare Professionals' Views on Monkeypox and Vaccine Hesitancy
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Background: Despite the low transmission risk of Monkeypox (mpox) in Belarus, this study is vital as it contributes to our understanding of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare professionals (HCPs). It aims to assess vaccination perceptions and evaluate the willingness to pay for the vaccine among Belarusian HCPs, thereby enhancing pandemic preparedness. Methods: in October 2022, a cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted among Belarusian HCPs using a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ). Invitations were disseminated via social media platforms using a snowball sampling method. The SAQ encompassed various categories, including sociodemographic details, medical history, sources of mpox information, perceived and factual mpox knowledge, and perceptions of the mpox vaccine according to the health belief model (HBM), mpox vaccine acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP). Results: while a large proportion of respondents had good knowledge of mpox epidemiology and its clinical manifestations, their awareness of available vaccines and treatment options was limited. Consequently, a significant correlation was found between the history of influenza vaccination and mpox-related knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed that just over half of the participants (51.4%) were willing to receive the mpox vaccine if offered for free, safely, and effectively, with their decision largely influenced by perceived benefits (Spearman's rho = 0.451) and cues to action (Spearman's rho = 0.349). However, a considerable degree of hesitancy (30.6%) and resistance (18.1%) towards the mpox vaccine was observed, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to address these issues. Conclusions: this study highlights a significant knowledge gap among Belarusian HCPs about mpox vaccines and treatments, despite a general awareness of the disease's epidemiology and symptoms, and it underscores the need for targeted interventions to enhance mpox knowledge and vaccine acceptance.

TI  - A Critical Review of Text Mining Applications for Suicide Research
T2  - CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Applying text mining to suicide research holds a great deal of promise. In this manuscript, literature from 2019 to 2021 is critically reviewed for text mining projects that use electronic health records, social media data, and death records. Recent Findings Text mining has helped identify risk factors for suicide in general and specific populations (e.g., older adults), has been combined with structured variables in EHRs to predict suicide risk, and has been used to track trends in social media suicidal discourse following population level events (e.g., COVID-19, celebrity suicides). Future research should utilize text mining along with data linkage methods to capture more complete information on risk factors and outcomes across data sources (e.g., combining death records and EHRs), evaluate effectiveness of NLP-based intervention programs that use suicide risk prediction, establish standards for reporting accuracy of text mining programs to enable comparison across studies, and incorporate implementation science to understand feasibility, acceptability, and technical considerations.

TI  - Attitudes and Perceptions of Health Protection Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 in Italy and Poland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and various health protection measures enforced (third section).Methods: The "health protection attitude score" (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting regression coefficients (RC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population. However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content control by providers of social platforms is recommended.

AB  - PurposeMental disorders are a public health concern with media as a primary source of information. This study aims to present current research on how the media reports mental disorders.MethodsThis study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 130 published studies on media coverage of mental disorders, focusing on the research themes and research trends of the published studies.ResultsThe results show that media coverage of mental disorders was generally negative and influenced by socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and cultural values). Results also show that social media was becoming crucial for mental health communication.ConclusionMedia worsen the stigma against those with mental disorders, continuing prejudice and discrimination. The field has shifted from traditional media to social media, and from general to specific mental disorder descriptions.

TI  - Effectiveness of a workplace intervention to reduce workplace bullying and violence at work: study protocol for a two-wave quasi-experimental intervention study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Bullying and violence at work are relatively common in Finnish public sector workplaces. Previous research has demonstrated their association with increased risk of poor health and well-being, but only few intervention studies exist. The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the development and assessment of the effectiveness of a workplace intervention aimed at reducing these harmful phenomena. Methods and analysis This protocol describes a two-wave quasi-experimental intervention. Each of the three participating Finnish public sector organisations (cities) will select four work units (a total of 450-500 employees) to participate in an intervention including 2-3 workshops for the work unit, 2-3 consultative meetings with the supervisor of the work unit, a follow-up meeting for the entire work unit (a maximum of 6-month time lag) and online meetings with the supervisor to monitor achievements and discuss about difficult cases, if any. Three age-matched, sex-matched and occupation-matched controls for each participants of the intervention group will be randomly selected, a total 1350-1500 individuals in the control group. For intervention and control groups, premeasurement is based on responses to a survey that was conducted in 2020. Postintervention measurement will be based on survey responses in 2022. Data will be analysed using latent change score modelling or difference-in-difference analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approvals are from the Ethics committees of the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district and the Finnish institute of Occupational Health. Results will be made available to participating organisations and their employees, the funder and other researchers via open access article in a peer-reviewed journal and subsequent reporting of the results via social media channels and press release to the public.

TI  - High continuous positive airway pressures versus non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in preterm neonates: protocol for a multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Low pressure nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has long been the mainstay of noninvasive respiratory support for preterm neonates, at a constant distending pressure of 5-8 cmH2O. When traditional nCPAP pressures are insufficient, other modes including nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are used. In recent years, high nCPAP pressures (>= 9 cmH2O) have also emerged as an alternative. However, the comparative benefits and risks of these modalities remain unknown.Methods and analysis In this multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial, infants < 29 weeks' gestational age (GA) who either: (A) fail treatment with traditional nCPAP or (B) being extubated from invasive mechanical ventilation with mean airway pressure >= 10 cmH(2)O, will be randomised to receive either high nCPAP (positive end-expiratory pressure 9-15 cmH2O) or NIPPV (target mean Paw 9-15 cmH(2)O). Primary outcome is feasibility of the conduct of a larger, definitive trial as assessed by rates of recruitment and protocol violations. The main secondary outcome is failure of assigned treatment within 7 days postrandomisation. Multiple other clinical outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be ascertained. All randomised participants will be analysed using intention to treat. Baseline and demographic variables as well as outcomes will be summarised and compared using univariate analyses, and a p < 0.05 will be considered significant.Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the respective research ethics boards at each institution (McMaster Children's Hospital: Hamilton integrated REB approval #2113; Royal Alexandra Hospital: Health Research Ethics Board approval ID Pro00090244; Westmead Hospital: Human Research Ethics Committee approval ID 2022/ETH01343). Written, informed consent will be obtained from all parents/guardians prior to study enrolment. The findings of this pilot study will be disseminated via presentations at national and international conferences and via publication in a peer reviewed journal. Social media platforms including Twitter will also be used to generate awareness.

TI  - Rationale and design of the CV-PREVITAL study: an Italian multiple cohort randomised controlled trial investigating innovative digital strategies in primary cardiovascular prevention
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of key importance in reducing morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide. Observational studies suggest that digital health interventions can be an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, evidence from large randomised clinical trials is lacking.
   Methods and analysis The CV-PREVITAL study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label interventional trial designed to compare the effectiveness of an educational and motivational mobile health (mHealth) intervention versus usual care in reducing CV risk. The intervention aims at improving diet, physical activity, sleep quality, psycho-behavioural aspects, as well as promoting smoking cessation and adherence to pharmacological treatment for CV risk factors. The trial aims to enrol approximately 80 000 subjects without overt CVDs referring to general practitioners' offices, community pharmacies or clinics of Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care (Italian acronym IRCCS) affiliated with the Italian Cardiology Network. All participants are evaluated at baseline and after 12 months to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on short-term endpoints, namely improvement in CV risk score and reduction of major CV risk factors. Beyond the funded life of the study, a long-term (7 years) follow-up is also planned to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on the incidence of major adverse CV events. A series of ancillary studies designed to evaluate the effect of the mHealth intervention on additional risk biomarkers are also performed.
   Ethics and dissemination This study received ethics approval from the ethics committee of the coordinating centre (Monzino Cardiology Center; R1256/20-CCM 1319) and from all other relevant IRBs and ethics committees. Findings are disseminated through scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals and via social media. Partners are informed about the study's course and findings through regular meetings.

TI  - A town level comprehensive intervention study to reduce salt intake in China: protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction
   Salt intake in China (approximate to 12 g/day) is more than twice the upper limit recommended by the WHO (5 g/day). To reduce salt intake, Action on Salt China (ASC) was launched in 2017. As one of four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the ASC programme, a comprehensive intervention study was designed to test whether all the components of the interventions adopted by other RCTs are acceptable, scalable and effective when provided to a region in the real world.
   Methods and analysis
   Using a cluster RCT design, 2688 participants were selected from 48 towns (clusters) in 12 counties in 6 provinces and assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Randomisation was performed after the baseline survey was completed. Information on salt-related knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP), blood pressure and 24-hour urinary sodium were collected. The intervention includes government engagement, health education and other intervention components targeting restaurants, home cooks and primary school students and their families that have been used in other RCTs. The control group will not receive the intervention. The project will be followed up for 2 years, with the intervention being carried out for the first year only. The primary outcome is salt intake measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion after 1 year. The secondary outcomes are the long-lasting effectiveness on salt intake and blood pressure measured by the same method, as well as salt-related KAP and blood pressure at the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. Process evaluation and health economics analysis will be conducted as well.
   Ethics and dissemination
   The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated through presentations, publications and social media.

TI  - Cohort profile: the British Columbia COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns Survey (BC-Mix)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Purpose Several non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, handwashing, self-isolation, and school and business closures, were implemented in British Columbia (BC) following the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 on 26 January 2020, to minimise in-person contacts that could spread infections. The BC COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns Survey (BC-Mix) was established as a surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the demographic characteristics of respondents. Participants The ongoing repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow-up survey is sent to participants 2-4 weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are weighted to BC's population by age, sex, geography and ethnicity to obtain generalisable estimates. Additional indices such as the Material and Social Deprivation Index, residential instability, economic dependency, and others are generated using census and location data. Findings to date As of 26 July 2021, over 61 000 baseline survey responses were received of which 41 375 were eligible for analysis. Of the eligible participants, about 60% consented to follow-up and about 27% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with healthcare databases. Approximately 83.5% of respondents were female, 58.7% were 55 years or older, 87.5% identified as white and 45.9% had at least a university degree. After weighting, approximately 50% were female, 39% were 55 years or older, 65% identified as white and 50% had at least a university degree. Future plans Multiple papers describing contact patterns, physical distancing measures, regular handwashing and facemask wearing, modelling looking at impact of physical distancing measures and vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and uptake are either in progress or have been published.

TI  - Using Open-Source Intelligence to Detect Early Signals of COVID-19 in China: Descriptive Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and the first cases were officially identified around December 8, 2019. Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using open-source data.
   Methods: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu.
   Results: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17.
   Conclusions: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31, 2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship, given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22 was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting that the infection was present prior to December.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Patient Experiences in the United States: 4-Year Content Analysis of Twitter
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Racial and ethnic minority groups often face worse patient experiences compared with the general population, which is directly related to poorer health outcomes within these minority populations. Evaluation of patient experience among racial and ethnic minority groups has been difficult due to lack of representation in traditional health care surveys.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying racial and ethnic disparities in patient experience across the United States from 2013 to 2016.
   Methods: In total, 851,973 patient experience tweets with geographic location information from the United States were collected from 2013 to 2016. Patient experience tweets included discussions related to care received in a hospital, urgent care, or any other health institution. Ordinary least squares multiple regression was used to model patient experience sentiment and racial and ethnic groups over the 2013 to 2016 period and in relation to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014.
   Results: Racial and ethnic distribution of users on Twitter was highly correlated with population estimates from the United States Census Bureau's 5-year survey from 2016 (r(2) =0.99; P<.001). From 2013 to 2016, the average patient experience sentiment was highest for White patients, followed by Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native patients. A reduction in negative patient experience sentiment on Twitter for all racial and ethnic groups was seen from 2013 to 2016. Twitter users who identified as Hispanic/Latino showed the greatest improvement in patient experience, with a 1.5 times greater increase (P<.001) than Twitter users who identified as White. Twitter users who identified as Black had the highest increase in patient experience postimplementation of the ACA (2014-2016) compared with preimplementation of the ACA (2013), and this change was 2.2 times (P<.001) greater than Twitter users who identified as White.
   Conclusions: The ACA mandated the implementation of the measurement of patient experience of care delivery. Considering that quality assessment of care is required, Twitter may offer the ability to monitor patient experiences across diverse racial and ethnic groups and inform the evaluation of health policies like the ACA.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake in Bangkok, Thailand: Cross-sectional Online Survey
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The third most severe COVID-19 wave in the middle of 2021 coincided with the dual challenges of limited vaccine supply and lagging acceptance in Bangkok, Thailand. Understanding of persistent vaccine hesitancy during the "608" campaign to vaccinate those aged over 60 years and 8 medical risk groups was needed. On-the-ground surveys place further demands on resources and are scale limited. We leveraged the University of Maryland COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (UMD-CTIS), a digital health survey conducted among daily Facebook user samples, to fill this need and inform regional vaccine rollout policy.Objective: The aims of this study were to characterize COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, frequent reasons for hesitancy, mitigating risk behaviors, and the most trusted sources of COVID-19 information through which to combat vaccine hesitancy in Bangkok, Thailand during the 608 vaccine campaign.Methods: We analyzed 34,423 Bangkok UMD-CTIS responses between June and October 2021, coinciding with the third COVID-19 wave. Sampling consistency and representativeness of the UMD-CTIS respondents were evaluated by comparing distributions of demographics, 608 priority groups, and vaccine uptake over time with source population data. Estimates of vaccine hesitancy in Bangkok and 608 priority groups were tracked over time. Frequently cited hesitancy reasons and trusted information sources were identified according to the 608 group and degree of hesitancy. Kendall tau was used to test statistical associations between vaccine acceptance and vaccine hesitancy.Results: The Bangkok UMD-CTIS respondents had similar demographics over weekly samples and compared to the Bangkok source population. Respondents self-reported fewer pre-existing health conditions compared to census data overall but had a similar prevalence of the important COVID-19 risk factor diabetes. UMD-CTIS vaccine uptake rose in parallel with national vaccination statistics, while vaccine hesitancy and degree of hesitancy declined (-7% hesitant per week). Concerns about vaccination side effects (2334/3883, 60.1%) and wanting to wait and see (2410/3883, 62.1%) were selected most frequently, while "not liking vaccines" (281/3883, 7.2%) and "religious objections" (52/3883, 1.3%) were selected least frequently. Greater vaccine acceptance was associated positively with wanting to "wait and see" and negatively with "don't believe I need (the vaccine)" (Kendall tau 0.21 and -0.22, respectively; adjusted P<.001). Scientists and health experts were most frequently cited as trusted COVID-19 information sources (13,600/14,033, 96.9%), even among vaccine hesitant respondents.Conclusions: Our findings provide policy and health experts with evidence that vaccine hesitancy was declining over the study timeframe. Hesitancy and trust analyses among the unvaccinated support Bangkok policy measures to address vaccine safety and efficacy concerns through health experts rather than government or religious officials. Large-scale surveys enabled by existing widespread digital networks offer an insightful minimal-infrastructure resource for informing region-specific health policy needs.

TI  - Families' healthcare experiences for children with inherited metabolic diseases: protocol for a mixed methods cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Children with inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) often have complex and intensive healthcare needs and their families face challenges in receiving high-quality, family centred health services. Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board, the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics boards of each participating study centre. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.

TI  - Polarity-Based Sentiment Analysis of Georeferenced Tweets Related to the 2022 Twitter Acquisition
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - Twitter, one of the most important social media platforms, has been in the headlines regularly since its acquisition by Elon Musk in October 2022. This acquisition has had a strong impact on the employees, functionality, and discourse on Twitter. So far, however, there has been no analysis that examines the perception of the acquisition by the users on the platform itself. For this purpose, in this paper, we use georeferenced Tweets from the US and classify them using a polarity-based sentiment analysis. We find that the number of Tweets about Twitter and Elon Musk has increased significantly, as have negative sentiments on the subject. Using a spatial hot spot analysis, we find distinct centres of discourse, but no clear evidence of their significant change over time. On the West Coast, however, we suspect the first signs of polarisation, which could be an important indication for the future development of discourse on Twitter.

TI  - Knowledge and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People With Severe Mental Illness in Bangladesh and Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Survey
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - BackgroundPeople with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are likely to face disproportionate challenges during a pandemic. They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MethodsWe conducted a telephone survey (May-June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. FindingsMass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice. ConclusionOur paper adds to the literature on people living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19 prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further attention.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'20)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - At-home DNA testing has become increasingly popular due to the ability to be able to gain both ancestry and health information, as well as connect with others who share your DNA. Do users have reasonable mental models of how these systems work? Do users have privacy concerns and what do they understand as the benefits and risks involved? We conducted 27 interviews with Canadian users of at-home DNA testing companies. Our interviews covered perceived and desired data use, data management, data sharing practices, control over data, and any regrets. Our qualitative analysis revealed that many users have inconsistencies in their mental models and liken their DNA data to their data stored with existing technologies, such as social media, rather than health data. They are generally either dismissive of privacy concerns towards themselves or their relatives or they had not considered privacy in their choice. We discuss our findings and propose possible future work in this area.

TI  - Hybrid Topic Cluster Models for Social Healthcare Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Social media and in particular, microblogs are becoming an important data source for disease surveillance, behavioral medicine, and public healthcare. Topic Models are widely used in microblog analytics for analyzing and integrating the textual data within a corpus. This paper uses health tweets as microblogs and attempts the health data clustering by topic models. The traditional topic models, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (PLSI), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and integer Joint NMF(intJNMF) methods are used for health data clustering; however, they are intractable to assess the number of health topic clusters. Proper visualizations are essential to extract the information from and identifying trends of data, as they may include thousands of documents and millions of words. For visualization of topic clouds and health tendency in the document collection, we present hybrid topic models by integrating traditional topic models with VAT. Proposed hybrid topic models viz., Visual Non-negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) and Visual Latent Schematic Indexing (VLSI) are promising methods for accessing the health tendency and visualization of topic clusters from benchmarked and Twitter datasets. Evaluation and comparison of hybrid topic models are presented in the experimental section for demonstrating the efficiency with different distance measures, include, Euclidean distance, cosine distance, and multi-viewpoint cosine similarity.

TI  - Big Data in Context: Addressing the Twin Perils of Data Absenteeism and Chauvinism in the Context of Health Disparities Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Recent advances in the collection and processing of health data from multiple sources at scale-known as big data-have become appealing across public health domains However, present discussions often do not thoroughly consider the implications of big data or health informatics in the context of continuing health disparities. The 2 key objectives of this paper were as follows: first, it introduced 2 main problems of health big data in the context of health disparities-data absenteeism (lack of representation from underprivileged groups) and data chauvinism (faith in the size of data without considerations for quality and contexts). Second, this paper suggested that health organizations should strive to go beyond the current fad and seek to understand and coordinate efforts across the surrounding societal-, organizational-, individual-, and data-level contexts in a realistic manner to leverage big data to address health disparities.

TI  - Generation of False-Positive SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Results with Testing Conditions outside Manufacturer Recommendations: A Scientific Approach to Pandemic Misinformation
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Antigen-based rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) are useful tools for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products. To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations. Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested with and without manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and Tween 20) as well as the impact of temperature (4 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 45 degrees C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance. Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer) resulted in false-positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2 positive controls tested under proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is nonspecific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function. Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of temperature and humidity outside manufacturer claims. Our data support strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false-positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation.
   IMPORTANCE With the Panbio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test being deployed in over 120 countries worldwide, understanding conditions required for its ideal performance is critical. Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed. While erroneous results from improper use of a test may not be surprising to some health care professionals, understanding why false positives occur can help reduce the propagation of misinformation and provide a scientific rebuttal for these aberrant findings. This study demonstrated that the kit buffer's pH, ionic strength, and buffering capacity were critical components to ensure proper kit function and avoid generation of false-positive results. Typically, false positives arise from cross-reacting or interfering substances; however, this study demonstrated a mechanism where false positives were generated under conditions favoring nonspecific interactions between the two antibodies designed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.

TI  - Re-emerging Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria: Re-enforcing "One Health" community surveillance and emergency response practice
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - We evaluated the impact of man-made conflict events and climate change impact in guiding evidence-based community "One Health" epidemiology and emergency response practice against re-/emerging epidemics. Increasing evidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases including recent Lassa fever outbreaks in almost 20 states in Nigeria led to 101 deaths and 175 suspected and confirmed cases since August 2015. Of the 75 laboratory confirmed cases, 90 deaths occurred representing 120% laboratory-confirmed case fatality. The outbreak has been imported into neighbouring country such as Benin, where 23 deaths out of 68 cases has also been reported. This study assesses the current trends in re-emerging Lassa fever outbreak in understanding spatio-geographical reservoir(s), risk factors pattern and Lassa virus incidence mapping, inherent gaps and raising challenges in health systems. It is shown that Lassa fever peak endemicity incidence and prevalence overlap the dry season (within January to March) and reduced during the wet season (of May to November) annually in Sierra Leone, Senegal to Eastern Nigeria. We documented a scarcity of consistent data on rodent (reservoirs)-linked Lassa fever outbreak, weak culturally and socio-behavioural effective prevention and control measures integration, weak or limited community knowledge and awareness to inadequate preparedness capacity and access to affordable case management in affected countries. Hence, robust sub/regional leadership commitment and investment in Lassa fever is urgently needed in building integrated and effective community "One Health" surveillance and rapid response approach practice coupled with pest management and phytosanitation measures against Lassa fever epidemic. This offers new opportunities in understanding human-animal interactions in strengthening Lassa fever outbreak early detection and surveillance, warning alerts and rapid response implementation in vulnerable settings. Leveraging on Africa CDC centre, advances in cloud-sourcing and social media tools and solutions is core in developing and integrating evidence-based and timely risk communication, and reporting systems in improving contextual community-based immunization and control decision making policy to effectively defeat Lassa fever outbreak and other emerging pandemics public health emergencies in Africa and worldwide.

TI  - Obesity and activity patterns before and during COVID-19 lockdown among youths in China
T2  - CLINICAL OBESITY
AB  - This study aim to assess changes in obesity and activity patterns among youths in China during the COVID-19 lockdown. We used the COVID-19 Impact on lifestyle change survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey distributed via social media platforms in early May 2020 where more than 10 000 youth participants in China have voluntarily reported their basic sociodemographic information, weight status, and routine lifestyles in the months before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The extended IOTF and WHO standards were used to define overweight and obesity of the participants. We used paired t-tests or chi(2) tests and non-parametric methods to evaluate the significance of differences in weight-related outcomes and lifestyles across education levels, between sexes, and before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The mean body mass index of all participating youths has significantly increased (21.8-22.6) and in all education subgroups during COVID-19 lockdown. Increases also occurred in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (21.3%-25.1%, P <.001) and obesity (10.5% to 12.9%, P <.001) in overall youths, especially in high school and undergraduate students. Their activity patterns had also significantly changed, including the decreased frequency of engaging in active transport, moderate-/vigorous-intensity housework, leisure-time moderate-/vigorous-intensity physical activity, and leisure-time walking, and the increased sedentary, sleeping, and screen time. Our findings would inform policy-makers and clinical practitioners of these changes in time, for better policy making and clinical practice. School administrators should also be informed of these changes, so in-class and/or extracurricular physical activity programs could be designed to counteract them.

TI  - Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID in Tunisian population
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented various challenges, one of which is the discovery that after the acute episode, around 30% of patients experience persistent symptoms or develop new ones, now known as long COVID. This new disease has significant social and financial impacts. The objective is to determine the prevalence of long COVID in the Tunisian population and identify its predictive factors.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study conducted among Tunisians who were infected with COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2022. An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed through social media, radio, and television channels over the course of one month (February 2022). Long COVID was defined as the persistence of existing symptoms or the development of new symptoms within three months after onset, lasting for at least two months, and with no differential diagnosis. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using binary stepwise logistic regression with a significance level set at 5%.ResultsA total of 1911 patients participated in our study, and the prevalence of long COVID was 46.5%. The two most frequent categories were general and neurological post-COVID syndrome, with a prevalence of 36.7% each. The most commonly observed symptoms were fatigue (63.7%) and memory problems (49.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive factors for long COVID were female gender and age of 60 years or older, while complete anti-COVID vaccination was found to be a protective factor.ConclusionsOur study found that complete vaccination was a protective factor against long COVID, while female gender and age of 60 years or older were identified as the main risk factors. These findings are consistent with studies conducted on other ethnic groups. However, many aspects of long COVID remain unclear, including its underlying mechanisms, the identification of which could guide the development of potential effective treatments.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and asymptomatic viral carriage in healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study
T2  - THORAX
AB  - Objective
   To determine the rates of asymptomatic viral carriage and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers.
   Design
   A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020.
   Setting
   University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK.
   Participants
   545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded.
   Intervention
   Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked.
   Main outcome measure
   Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology.
   Results
   The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, chi(2)=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02).
   Conclusions and relevance
   We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude, perception, and factors associated with the risk perception of COVID-19 among nursing college students in Japanese universities: A cross-sectional study
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Background and Aim The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world has brought different attitudes and perceptions among social strata. Nursing students being future first-line healthcare workers are more at risk of being infected and exposed to various stressors from shared information. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 among nursing students and to estimate predictors of their risk perception. Methods We conducted an online survey among undergraduate nursing students at three selected Japanese Universities. Data on knowledge, attitude, and perception toward COVID-19 were collected using a structured questionnaire. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with the risk perception toward COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 414 nursing students who participated in the study, 368 (90.4%) reported that the media including radio, television, internet, and/or social media were the main source of knowledge. Fever (96.1%) and dry cough (89.6%) were reported as the main symptoms. Regarding the attitude toward the treatment and preventive measures, almost 92.8% of participants recommended the use of vaccines. Being female appeared to be three times associated with the fear of getting infected (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-7.58). Students who took part in extracurricular activities reported that they feared being infected with COVID-19 (aOR:2.62; 95% CI:1.33-5.16). Other factors did not show an association. Conclusion Knowledge and attitude of nursing students toward COVID-19 were accurate for the majority of them, with the main source of information being the media. Practicing extracurricular activities and being female were associated with the fear of the disease. Efficient and controlled communication is needed during widespread disease outbreaks.

AB  - Introduction
   Exploiting information in health-related social media services is of great interest for patients, researchers and medical companies. The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information.
   Material and methods
   We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as "experience", "fact" or "opinion", and as "positive", "negative" and "neutral". Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus.
   Results
   We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (approximate to 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial.

TI  - Improving the quality of routine maternal and newborn data captured in primary health facilities in Gombe State, Northeastern Nigeria: a before-and-after study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Primary objective: to assess nine data quality metrics for 14 maternal and newborn health data elements, following implementation of an integrated, district-focused data quality intervention. Secondary objective: to consider whether assessing the data quality metrics beyond completeness and accuracy of facility reporting offered new insight into reviewing routine data quality. Design Before-and-after study design. Setting Primary health facilities in Gombe State, Northeastern Nigeria. Participants Monitoring and evaluation officers and maternal, newborn and child health coordinators for state-level and all 11 local government areas (district-equivalent) overseeing 492 primary care facilities offering maternal and newborn care services. Intervention Between April 2017 and December 2018, we implemented an integrated data quality intervention which included: introduction of job aids and regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support through social media. Outcome measures 9 metrics for the data quality dimensions of completeness and timeliness, internal consistency of reported data, and external consistency. Results The data quality intervention was associated with improvements in seven of nine data quality metrics assessed including availability and timeliness of reporting, completeness of data elements, accuracy of facility reporting, consistency between related data elements, and frequency of outliers reported. Improvement differed by data element type, with content of care and commodity-related data improving more than contact-related data. Increases in the consistency between related data elements demonstrated improved internal consistency within and across facility documentation. Conclusions An integrated district-focused data quality intervention-including regular self-assessment of data quality, peer-review and feedback, learning workshops, work planning for improvement, and ongoing support through social media-can increase the completeness, accuracy and internal consistency of facility-based routine data.

TI  - Health Management System Knowledge Base for Formation and Support of a Preventive Measures Plan
T2  - POSTPROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES (BICA 2018)
CP  - 9th Annual International Conference of the Biologically-Inspired-Cognitive-Architectures-Society (BICA) held as part of the Joint Multi-Conference on Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI)
AB  - This paper describes the creation of a knowledge base for an intelligent healthcare management system dealing with cases of stroke, myocardial infarction and depression. The main purpose of the knowledge base is to discover and evaluate risk factors and situations which can lead to such diseases, and to enable the formation and support of a preventative measures plan. The present version of the knowledge base is implemented using a heterogeneous semantic network approach and utilizes expert opinions about risk factors and events influencing an individual's health. Data includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and external environment. Data is compiled with the aid of questionnaires, mobile devices, case histories and information from social media. Information from social media is analyzed using data and text mining methods with the goal of evaluating the user's condition. All of the data obtained is accumulated in a single database. The knowledge base establishes risk factors, including changes in those factors over the course of time, and circumstances or events which might precipitate the emergence of pathology. Hypotheses are generated about the current state of the user's health, the active risk factors which created conditions for the onset of disease, and circumstances which might produce an increase or decrease in risk factors. Prophylactic measures to reduce those risks are suggested through analysis of the hypotheses generated. Recommendations regarding prophylactic measures are formed with the aid of the knowledge base, the user case-library, and collaborative filtering methods. Recommendations are based on 4P medicine, which re-quires mandatory participation of system users in maintaining their health. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Illness severity and risk of mental morbidities among patients recovering from COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in the Icelandic population
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To test if patients recovering from COVID-19 are at increased risk of mental morbidities and to what extent such risk is exacerbated by illness severity. Design Population-based cross-sectional study. Setting Iceland. Participants A total of 22 861 individuals were recruited through invitations to existing nationwide cohorts and a social media campaign from 24 April to 22 July 2020, of which 373 were patients recovering from COVID-19. Main outcome measures Symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; modified Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) above screening thresholds. Adjusting for multiple covariates and comorbidities, multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the association between COVID-19 severity and mental morbidities. Results Compared with individuals without a diagnosis of COVID-19, patients recovering from COVID-19 had increased risk of depression (22.1% vs 16.2%; adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.48, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.82) and PTSD (19.5% vs 15.6%; aRR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75) but not anxiety (13.1% vs 11.3%; aRR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.64). Elevated relative risks were limited to patients recovering from COVID-19 that were 40 years or older and were particularly high among individuals with university education. Among patients recovering from COVID-19, symptoms of depression were particularly common among those in the highest, compared with the lowest tertile of influenza-like symptom burden (47.1% vs 5.8%; aRR 6.42, 95% CI 2.77 to 14.87), among patients confined to bed for 7 days or longer compared with those never confined to bed (33.3% vs 10.9%; aRR 3.67, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.86) and among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 compared with those never admitted to hospital (48.1% vs 19.9%; aRR 2.72, 95% CI 1.67 to 4.44). Conclusions Severe disease course is associated with increased risk of depression and PTSD among patients recovering from COVID-19.

Methods A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. Results We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients' and rheumatologists' acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.

TI  - Restaurant interventions for salt reduction in China: protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Salt intake in China is high, and most of it comes from that added by consumers. Nevertheless, recent years have seen a rapid increase in the frequency at which people eat out. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed for salt reduction in restaurants through a randomised controlled trial in China. Methods and analysis As a randomised controlled trial with restaurants as study subjects, we recruited 192 restaurants from 12 counties of 6 provinces in China. After the baseline survey, restaurants were randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Using social cognitive theory, comprehensive intervention activities were designed to encourage salt reduction in all restaurant foods, and at the same time, to encourage consumers to choose lower salt options when eating out. The interventions will be conducted only in restaurants of the intervention group during the first year. The follow-up assessment will be conducted at the end of the trial. The primary outcome is the change in the average salt content of the five best-selling dishes of the restaurant, as measured by laboratory tests. Secondary outcomes include differences in the monthly use of salt and salty condiments between intervention and control restaurants, and the knowledge, attitude and practice on salt among restaurant consumers. Ethics and dissemination The study was reviewed and approved by the Review Board of the National Institute for Nutrition and Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated through presentations, publications and social media.

TI  - A Geo-Social Characterization of Health Impact from Air Pollution in Mexico Valley
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - The impact of the air pollution phenomenon has been long studied, but most often with a fragmented approach, without closely looking at the relationship between different components that characterize it, such as sensor-based data, health data from institutional databases, and data on how it is perceived by human beings in social media. The research developed in this study introduces an integrated methodological framework that analyses sensor data on air pollution distributed in space and time, combined with health data and social data narratives that reflect how different communities perceive this phenomenon in space and time; exploring how these different heterogeneous sources can be combined to better understand the impact of air pollution phenomena at the large-city level in the Valley of Mexico. We introduce a Spatio-temporal data integration and mining framework that aims to discover trends and insights regarding the distribution of the impact of an air pollution phenomenon in terms of human health and perception. The main peculiarity of our methodological framework is the integration of different large data sources by combining a series of methods: NLP (topic modeling), data mining (data cubes, unsupervised learning, and clustering), and GIS capabilities (spatial interpolation, choropleth maps) that together provide a better understanding of the quantitative and qualitative patterns emerging at a different spatial scale and temporal granularity. Overall, this shows how social data, when combined with quantitative data, can provide a better understanding of the impact of a given phenomenon, such as air pollution.

TI  - Assessing disparities in medical students' knowledge and attitude about monkeypox: a cross-sectional study of 27 countries across three continents
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background and aimsThe recent monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the importance of evaluating the knowledge and attitude of medical students toward emerging diseases, given their potential roles as healthcare professionals and sources of public information during outbreaks. This study aimed to assess medical students' knowledge and attitude about Mpox and to identify factors affecting their level of knowledge and attitude in low-income and high-income countries. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on 11,919 medical students from 27 countries. A newly-developed validated questionnaire was used to collect data on knowledge (14 items), attitude (12 items), and baseline criteria. The relationship between a range of factors with knowledge and attitude was studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results46% of the study participants were males; 10.7% were in their sixth year; 54.6% knew about smallpox; 84% received the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine; and 12.5% had training on Mpox. 55.3% had good knowledge of Mpox and 51.7% had a positive attitude towards it. Medical students in their third, fifth, or sixth year high- income countries who obtained information on Mpox from friends, research articles, social media and scientific websites were positive predictors for good knowledge. Conversely, being male or coming from high-income countries showed a negative relation with good knowledge about Mpox. Additionally, a positive attitude was directly influenced by residing in urban areas, being in the fifth year of medical education, having knowledge about smallpox and a history of receiving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Receiving information about Mpox from social media or scientific websites and possessing good knowledge about Mpox were also predictors of a positive attitude. On the other hand, being male, employed, or receiving a training program about Mpox were inversely predicting positive attitude about Mpox. ConclusionThere were differences in knowledge and attitude towards Mpox between medical students in low and high-income countries, emphasizing the need for incorporating epidemiology of re-emerging diseases like Mpox into the medical curriculum to improve disease prevention and control.

TI  - Long COVID in the Belgian Defence forces: prevalence, risk factors and impact on quality of daily functioning
T2  - BMJ MILITARY HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionLong COVID (LC) is a medical condition first described and documented through anecdotes on social media by patients prior to being recognised by WHO as a disease. Although >50 prolonged symptoms of LC have been described, it remains a diagnostic challenge for military providers and therefore threatens operational readiness. MethodsOn 9 September 2021, an online survey was emailed to 2192 Belgian Defence personnel who had previously tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 17 August 2020 and 31 May 2021. A total of 718 validated responses were received.Descriptive analyses determined the prevalence of LC and 10 most common symptoms and their duration following infection. In the explanatory analyses, risk factors related to LC were identified. To establish the health-related impact of LC on quality of life (HRQoL), we used the results from the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire. ResultsThe most frequent symptoms that were reported for >3 months were fatigue, lack of energy and breathing difficulties.47.35% of the respondents reported at least one persistent symptom, while 21.87% reported more than 3 symptoms lasting for at least 3 months after the initial COVID-19 infection. Most patients with LC suffered from symptoms of a neuropsychiatric nature (71.76%).LC was significantly associated with obesity; pre-existing respiratory disease and blood or immune disorders. Physical activity of >3 hours per week halved the risk of LC.The total QoL is reduced in patients with LC. Considering the five dimensions of the questionnaire, only the self-care dimension was not influenced by the presence of LC. ConclusionsAlmost half of Belgian Defence personnel developed LC after a confirmed COVID-19 infection, similar to numbers found in the Belgian population. Patients with LC would likely benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach that addresses shortness of breath, fatigue and mood disturbance.

TI  - Prevalence of frailty and pain in hospitalised adult patients in an acute hospital: a protocol for a point prevalence observational study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Frailty and pain are associated with adverse patient clinical outcomes and healthcare system costs. Frailty and pain can interact, such that symptoms of frailty can make pain assessment difficult and pain can exacerbate the progression of frailty. The prevalence of frailty and pain and their concurrence in hospital settings are not well understood, and patients with cognitive impairment are often excluded from pain prevalence studies due to difficulties assessing their pain. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of frailty and pain in adult inpatients, including those with cognitive impairment, in an acute care private metropolitan hospital in Western Australia. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational, single-day point prevalence, cross-sectional study of frailty and pain intensity of all inpatients (excluding day surgery and critical care units) will be undertaken. Frailty will be assessed using the modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale. Current pain intensity will be assessed using the PainChek smart-device application enabling pain assessment in people unable to report pain due to cognitive impairment. Participants will also provide a numerical rating of the intensity of current pain and the worst pain experienced in the previous 24 hours. Demographic and clinical information will be collected from patient files. The overall response rate of the survey will be reported, as well as the percentage prevalence of frailty and of pain in the sample (separately for PainChek scores and numerical ratings). Additional statistical modelling will be conducted comparing frailty scores with pain scores, adjusting for covariates including age, gender, ward type and reason for admission. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by Ramsay Health Care Human Research Ethics Committee WA/SA (reference: 2038) and Edith Cowan University Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: 2020-02008-SAUNDERS). Findings will be widely disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and social media.

TI  - Using Hawkes Processes to model imported and local malaria cases in near-elimination settings
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Author summary
   This paper introduces a mathematically well-founded method for infectious disease outbreaks known as Hawkes Processes. These semi-mechanistic models are relatively new to the infectious diseases toolkit and enable us to combine disease specific information such as the infectious profile with statistical rigour to recreate temporal disease transmission. We show that these methods are very suited to modelling malaria in communities close to eliminating malaria-in particular China and Eswatini-where we are able to disentangle the contribution of exogenous (external) transmission and endogenous (person-to-person) transmission. This is particularly important for developing policies when counties are approaching elimination.
   Developing new methods for modelling infectious diseases outbreaks is important for monitoring transmission and developing policy. In this paper we propose using semi-mechanistic Hawkes Processes for modelling malaria transmission in near-elimination settings. Hawkes Processes are well founded mathematical methods that enable us to combine the benefits of both statistical and mechanistic models to recreate and forecast disease transmission beyond just malaria outbreak scenarios. These methods have been successfully used in numerous applications such as social media and earthquake modelling, but are not yet widespread in epidemiology. By using domain-specific knowledge, we can both recreate transmission curves for malaria in China and Eswatini and disentangle the proportion of cases which are imported from those that are community based.

TI  - Coronavirus pandemic in Vietnam: an effective response model
T2  - SOCIAL IDENTITIES
AB  - In late December 2019, the World Health Organisation declared that pneumonia of unknown aetiology broke out in China and then expanded to become a pandemic. Vietnam was predicted to be one of the hardest-hit countries of this pandemic. However, this country has written its own exceptional story with a low and contained infection rate and few deaths on its territory. This study seeks to highlight the global significance of the Vietnamese response model in the fight against COVID-19. The study suggests that the Vietnamese Government's procedures, from central officials to grassroots cadre, have significance on three levels with comparative importance. First, attention is given to the use of tracking mechanisms enabled by medical surveillance and record systems. Then, the role of social media in educational epidemiology. Finally, we highlight the adjustment of Vietnamese social practices, behaviours, and cultural habituation, which were crucial in fighting the pandemic. These results of this study suggest an effective, low-cost model in combating pandemic which could be applied by other countries, despite a surprising, but sadly recurrent, the reluctance of international media to represent Vietnam fairly and impartially. The paper draws attention to the importance of Vietnam's experience in tracking systems, health, and education, aiming to illustrate effective measures that have global significance and suggest opportunities for international implementation.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Results from an Observational Study in Primary Care in Belgium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - COVID-19 also affects pregnant and breastfeeding women. Hence, clinicians and policymakers require reliable evidence on COVID-19 epidemiology and consequences in this population. We aimed to assess the susceptibility of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and women's perceived impact of the pandemic on their breastfeeding practices, medical counseling and social support. We performed a cross-sectional study using an online survey in primary care in Belgium. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and women who breastfed in the preceding four weeks were eligible to participate. The survey was distributed through social media in April 2020. In total, 6470 women participated (i.e., 2647 pregnant and 3823 breastfeeding women). Overall, 0.3% of all respondents reported to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, not indicating a higher susceptibility of pregnant women to contracting COVID-19. More than 90% refuted that the pandemic affected their breastfeeding practices, nor indicated that the coronavirus was responsible for breastfeeding cessation. Half of the women even considered giving longer breastmilk because of the coronavirus. In contrast, women's medical counseling and social support were negatively affected by the lockdown. Women without previous breastfeeding experience and in the early postpartum period experienced a higher burden in terms of reduced medical counseling and support. In the future, more consideration and alternative supportive measures such as tele-visits by midwives or perinatal organizations are required for these women.

AB  - Big data is the compilation of enormous data that arrives from diverse sources for instance online transaction details, social media, sensor data, etc. Such assortment of enormous data developed is tough to evaluate by conventional processing relevance's. By the development and upcoming latent in the healthcare business field, it is essential to analyze an enormous noisy data to get significant information. In healthcare system, the aim of this work is to evaluate the medical database of diabetes patients by a mixture of innovative hierarchical decision attention network, association rules (AR) and multiclass outlier classification with MapReduce framework. The association rule apriori algorithm in a MapReduce framework considers health data to create regulations. This is employed to discover the association among disease and their signs. This examination is made by means of UCI machine learning datasets of diabetes containing 50 attributes. The results of the proposed algorithm are offered by parameters for instance precision, accuracy, recall, and F-score. (C) 2021 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS).

TI  - Distributed time-respecting flow graph pattern matching on temporal graphs
T2  - WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Graph pattern matching, one of the most fundamental graph problems, has been extensively investigated in the literature. Nonetheless, existing efforts mostly focus on general graphs without time information, few studies concentrate on temporal graphs, where a relationship between two vertices takes place at a specific moment and lingers for some time. Moreover, real-world temporal networks become increasingly large, and are usually distributed over multiple machines. These foster the need for evaluating pattern matching on distributed temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a new notion so-called time-respecting flow graph, in which all paths spreading from one vertex to another are time-respecting (i.e., a series of contacts with non-decreasing time), and one vertex is distinguished as the root from which other vertices can be reached via a time-respecting path. Based on this, we explore the problem of distributed time-respecting flow graph pattern matching on temporal graphs, which could be applied in many fields such as epidemiology, social media, national security, communication, to name just a few. We present a distributed baseline algorithm based on GraphX as well as an optimized algorithm that utilizes the properties of time-respecting flow graph and the analyses of distributed algorithms to boost efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of our proposed algorithms.

TI  - Potential risk factors for celiac disease in childhood: a case-control epidemiological survey
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Background: Celiac disease (CD) prevalence has increased significantly in recent decades in some developed countries. Yet the environmental factors in the existing literature do not appear to provide a satisfactory explanation for this increase.
   Objective: To determine whether nine variables are associated with CD in children. These variables are: incidence of ear infection before 2 years old, courses of antibiotics before 2 years old, duration of breastfeeding, vitamin D drop exposure in infancy, vitamin D supplement exposure between 2-3 years old, age at gluten introduction into the diet, fat content of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, quantity of cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old, and type of water consumed at 2 years old.
   Methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted among parents living in the US with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years old. Potential participants were informed about the survey through social media, websites, electronic newsletters, and advertisements.
   Results: After exclusions, there remained 332 responses associated with children with CD (cases), and 241 responses associated with children who do not have CD (controls). In this data set, skim milk as the primary form of liquid cow's milk consumed between 2-3 years old (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.556, CI=1.430-10.22, P=0.010), vitamin D drops administered for more than 3 months (aOR=1.749, CI=1.079-2.872, P=0.025), courses of antibiotics (aOR=1.133, CI=1.037-1.244, P=0.007), and incidence of ear infection (aOR=1.183, CI=1.041-1.348, P=0.010) are all associated with CD in children.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to find an association between skim milk consumption and CD and vitamin D drop use for greater than 3 months and CD. It also adds to evidence that early life exposure to antibiotics and early life infection, specifically ear infection, are associated with CD.

TI  - Structural Inequities and Social Networks Impact Hormone Use and Misuse Among Transgender Women in Los Angeles County
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AB  - In order to reduce gender dysphoria and combat stigma, transgender women often affirm their gender through social and medical transition, which may include cross-sex hormone therapy. This study examined associations between medically monitored hormone use and hormone misuse (non-prescribed hormone use including "fillers"), structural inequities (access to housing, health insurance, and income), and social network dynamics among 271 transgender women in Los Angeles. Hormone use status was coded trichotomously (hormone use, hormone misuse, no hormone use), and robust multinomial logistic regression as well as novel social network analysis was conducted to examine associations. Results demonstrated that younger, African-American/Black transgender women were most likely to engage in hormone misuse compared to transgender women who were older or non-African-American/Black. One-third of the sample reported sex work as a main source of income, and this group was more likely to misuse hormones than those with another primary source of income. Transgender women with access to stable housing and health insurance were most likely to engage in medically monitored hormone use. Social network analysis revealed that transgender women with a greater number of hormone-using network alters were most likely to misuse hormones, but that using the Internet to find transgender friends mitigated this association. Results demonstrate the multifaceted risk profile of transgender women who use and misuse hormones, including that social networks play an important role in hormone usage among transgender women.

TI  - Using Days Alive and Out of Hospital to measure inequities and possible pathways for them after cardiovascular surgery in Aotearoa New Zealand: study protocol for a secondary data analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionIn Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), socioeconomic status and being of Maori ethnicity are often associated with poorer health outcomes, including after surgery. Inequities can be partially explained by differences in health status and health system biases are hypothesised as important factors for remaining inequities. Previous work identified inequities between Maori and non-Maori following cardiovascular surgery, some of which have been identified in studies between 1990 and 2012. Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) is an emerging surgical outcome metric. DAOH is a composite measure of outcomes, which may reflect patient experience and longer periods of DAOH may also reflect extended interactions with the health system. Recently, a 1.1-day difference in DAOH was observed between Maori and non-Maori at a hospital in NZ across a range of operations. Methods and analysisWe will conduct a secondary data analysis using data from the National Minimum Data Set, maintained by the Ministry of Health. We will report unadjusted and risk-adjusted DAOH values between Maori and non-Maori using direct risk standardisation. We will risk adjust first for age and sex, then for each of deprivation (NZDep18), levels of morbidity (M3 score) and rurality. We will report DAOH values across three time periods, 30, 90 and 365 days and across nine deciles of the DAOH distribution (0.1-0.9 inclusive). We will interpret all results from a Kaupapa Maori research positioning, acknowledging that Maori health outcomes are directly tied to the unequal distribution of the social determinants of health. Ethics and disseminationEthics approval for this study was given by the Auckland Health Research Ethics Committee. Outputs from this study are likely to interest a range of audiences. We plan to disseminate our findings through academic channels, presentations to interested groups including Maori-specific hui (meetings), social media and lay press.

TI  - Improvement for most, but not all: changes in newspaper coverage of mental illness from 2008 to 2019 in England
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
AB  - Aims
   Time to Change, an anti-stigma programme in England, has worked to reduce stigma relating to mental illness in many facets of life. Newspaper reports are an important factor in shaping public attitudes towards mental illnesses, as well as working as a barometer reflecting public opinion. This study aims to assess the way that coverage of mental health topics and different mental illnesses has changed since 2008.
   Method
   Articles covering mental health in 18 different newspapers were retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days of each month in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. A content analysis approach using a structured coding framework was used to extract information from the articles. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the change in odds of each hypothesised stigmatising or anti-stigmatising element occurring in 2019 compared to 2008 and 2016 with a Wald test to assess the overall significance of year as a predictor in the model. Further logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the diagnosis that an article was about and the odds that it was stigmatising, and whether this relationship is moderated by year of publication.
   Results
   A total of 6731 articles were analysed, and there was a significant increase in anti-stigmatising articles in 2019 compared to 2008 (OR 3.16 (2.60-3.84), p < 0.001) and 2016 (OR 1.40 (1.16-1.69), p < 0.001). Of the 5142 articles that specified a diagnosis, articles about schizophrenia were 6.37 times more likely to be stigmatising than articles about other diagnoses (OR 6.37 (3.05-13.29) p < 0.001), and there was evidence that the strength of this relationship significantly interacted with the year an article was published (p = 0.010). Articles about depression were significantly less likely to be stigmatising (OR 0.59 (0.69-0.85) p = 0.018) than those about other diagnoses, while there was no difference in coverage of eating disorders v. other diagnoses (OR 1.37 (0.67-2.80) p = 0.386); neither of these relationships showed an interaction with the year of publication.
   Conclusion
   Anti-stigma programmes should continue to work with newspapers to improve coverage of mental illness. However, interventions should consider providing specific guidance and promote awareness of rarer mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, and evaluation should examine whether reductions in stigma extend to people with all mental illness diagnoses.

TI  - Quantifying audio visual alcohol imagery in popular Indian films: a content analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Though exposure to alcohol imagery in films is a significant determinant of uptake and severity of alcohol consumption among young people, there is poor evidence regarding the content of alcohol imagery in films in low-income and middle-income countries. We have measured alcohol imagery content and branding in popular Indian films, in total and in relation to language and age rating.
   Design In this observational study we measured alcohol imagery semiquantitatively using 5-minute interval coding. We coded each interval according to whether it contained alcohol imagery or brand appearances.
   Setting India.
   Participants None. Content analysis of a total of 30 national box office hit films over a period of 3years from 2015 to 2017.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures To assess alcohol imagery in Indian films and its distribution in relation to age and language rating has been determined.
   Results The 30 films included 22 (73%) Hindi films and 8 (27%) in regional languages. Seven (23%) were rated suitable for viewing by all ages (U), and 23 (77%) rated as suitable for viewing by children subject to parental guidance for those aged under 12 (UA). Any alcohol imagery was seen in 97% of the films, with 195 of a total of 923 5-minute intervals, and actual alcohol use in 25 (83%) films, in 90 (10%) intervals. The occurrence of these and other categories of alcohol imagery was similar in U-rated and UA-rated films, and in Hindi and local language films. Episodes of alcohol branding occurred in 10 intervals in five films.
   Conclusion Almost all films popular in India contain alcohol imagery, irrespective of age rating and language. Measures need to be undertaken to limit alcohol imagery in Indian films to protect the health of young people, and to monitor alcohol imagery in other social media platforms in future.

TI  - Impacts of lockdown on dietary patterns among youths in China: the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION
AB  - Objective: To assess changes in dietary patterns among youths in China after COVID-19 lockdown. Design: This study was based on the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey established in early May 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms. The sociodemographic information and routine dietary patterns before and after lockdown of participants were investigated. t tests and chi (2) tests were used to compare the differences in consumption patterns of twelve major food groups and beverages between sex and across educational levels before and after lockdown. Factor analysis was employed to obtain the main dietary patterns. Settings: China. Participants: A total of 10 082 youths. Results: A significant decrease was observed in the average weekly frequency of rice intake, while significant increases were observed in the frequency of intake of wheat products, other staple foods, fish, eggs, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit and dairy products (all P values < 0 center dot 01). Heterogeneities of average weekly frequency existed between sex and across educational levels to different extents. The three main dietary patterns derived were loaded most heavily on dairy products, rice and wheat products, separately; the rice pattern became more dominant than the wheat products pattern after lockdown. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased, while the frequency of other beverages had increased. Conclusions: Our timely survey would inform policymakers and health professionals of these significant changes in youths' dietary patterns after lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sex and across educational levels, for better policy-making and public health practice.

TI  - Gender differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative measures and preferred sources of COVID-19 information among adolescents and young adults with cancer
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the behavior of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. No data exists on how gender influences the adherence of individuals with cancer to COVID-19 related public health guidelines and their preferred methods of receiving COVID-19 related information.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults with cancer. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and women.
   Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative measures was 44.9-58.8% for males and 53.4-68.1% for females. After adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.45, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not touching face (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive information from their cancer institutes and social media.
   Discussion: Gender-specific interventions are needed to improve the adherence of males to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Information should be disseminated via cancer institutes and social media as these are the preferred sources of COVID-19 related information among AYAs with cancer.

TI  - Cleft Lip and Palate Research in Low- and Middle-income Countries: A Scientometric Analysis
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
AB  - Background: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) comprise over 90% of the world's congenital anomalies and cause significant disability worldwide, while disproportionally burdening low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Research can help inform strategies that reduce disparities in accessing CLP care. We performed a scientometric analysis of CLP research in LMICs to identify influential contributors and themes.
   Methods: The authors searched seven citation databases accessed via Web of Science, from inception to March 2, 2021. Social network analysis was done using VOSviewer. The Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were used.
   Results: In total, 1561 articles authored by 6414 researchers affiliated with 2113 organizations in 119 countries were included. Most authors (n = 6387, 99.6%) had published two or more articles. The USA (454 articles), Brazil (211 articles), China (175 articles), and India (127 articles) published the most. The most prolific institutions were the University of Sao Paulo (94 articles), the University of Pittsburgh (57 articles), and the University of Iowa (55 articles). Marazita ML (33 articles), Shi B (27 articles), and Murray JC (22 articles) had the highest number of publications. An estimated 510 articles (32.7%) were focused on epidemiology, 240 (15.4%) on management, and 54 (3.5%) on global plastic surgery for CLP.
   Conclusions: LMICs are disproportionally burdened by CLP, but research is limited and often produced by high-income countries. This study elucidates partnership and health system strengthening opportunities to improve LMIC research capacity and ultimately informs the management and outcomes for patients with CLP.

TI  - Capturing COVID-19-Like Symptoms at Scale Using Banner Ads on an Online News Platform: Pilot Survey Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Identifying new COVID-19 cases is challenging. Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors.
   Methods: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area.
   Results: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001).
   Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R-2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age.
   Conclusions: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.

TI  - COVID-19's impact on contraception experiences: Exacerbation of structural inequities in women's health
T2  - CONTRACEPTION
AB  - Introduction: Structural inequities may impact the relationship between COVID-19 and access to contraception. Methods: In July 2020 and January 2021, we used social media to survey 2 samples of women of reproductive age who had not been surgically sterilized and were not currently pregnant about their experiences seeking contraception. We explore whether experiences differed for people experiencing social and/or economic disadvantage due to COVID-19, using multivariable logistic regression to control for age, education and income. Results: In July 2020, 51.5% of respondents who sought contraception (total N = 3064) reported barriers to care compared to 55.3% in January 2021 (total N = 2276). A larger percent (14% in July 2020 and 22% in Jan 2021) reported not using their preferred method of contraception due to COVID-19. Individuals experiencing income loss (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.04 early in the COVID-19 pandemic and OR = 1.58, 1.21-2.06 mid COVID-19 pandemic) and hunger (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.40 early and OR = 2.02, 1.55-2.64 mid-COVID-19 pandemic) were more likely to report they would be using a different method if not for COVID-19, compared to respondents without income loss or hunger. Conclusions: COVID-19 has complicated access to contraception, especially for disadvantaged populations. Implications: Effort s are needed to ensure access to contraception despite the COVID-19 epidemic, especially for disadvantaged populations. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The portrayal and perceptions of cesarean section in Mexican media Facebook pages: a mixed-methods study
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Plain Language Summary Cesarean section is a medical intervention that can save women and babies when there are complications during pregnancy or birth. Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean section in the world (45%); much higher than what we would expect. We do not fully understand why this is happening, but we think social influences are important. We know that traditional and social media are important social influences on health and health-seeking behaviors in other countries. In our study, we aimed to explore how cesarean section is portrayed in Facebook Mexican media pages, and how people (Facebook users) interacted with these articles. To do this, we identified the most popular Facebook media pages in Mexico. Next, we searched for all articles posted to these pages. We found 80 articles and studied them to understand how they discussed cesarean section. We found that media articles posted on Facebook did not encourage women to have cesarean section, and they correctly showed risks and consequences. Then, we explored the comments from Facebook users that were attached to these posts about cesarean section. We found 6350 comments, and classified each comment based on the what the Facebook users said. Lastly, we connected the main themes of the articles to the types of comments. We found that Facebook users distrusted the Mexican health system, rejected information about the consequences of cesarean section, and often responded with the content with sexist and aggressive comments against women. Our research shows that while there is accurate and useful information on social media about cesarean section, other social issues like gender inequality and violence may influence pregnancy and childbirth.
   Background Mexico has one of the highest rates of cesarean sections globally at over 45%. There is limited research about social factors influencing these rates. This study explores the portrayal and perceptions of cesarean section in Facebook media pages to better understand the socio-cultural context of childbirth in Mexico. Methods This is a mixed-methods social media analysis using two data sources. First, to study the portrayal of cesarean section, we identified ten Mexican media Facebook pages with the largest audiences (based on number of page "likes"). We searched these pages for articles containing the word "cesarea" (Spanish for cesarean section), and posts (articles) were eligible for inclusion if they contained the word "cesarea". Second, to understand perceptions of cesarean section portrayal, we extracted comment threads of each Facebook post sharing the included articles. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of articles and a quantitative content analysis of comments. Results We included 133 Facebook posts depicting 80 unique articles and identified three major themes: (1) information about cesarean section, (2) inequality and violence against women, (3) governance failures. Cesarean section was portrayed as a lifesaving procedure when medical necessary, and riskier than vaginal birth, with a longer recovery time, and possible negative health consequences. We extracted comments from 133 Facebook posts, and 6350 comments were included. We inductively developed 20 codes to then classify comments under six major categories: (1) violence and discrimination, (2) health and health services, (3) mode of birth choice, (4) disbelief at information about cesarean section, (5) abortion, and (6) discontent at the government. Conclusions We found that Facebook media did not promote cesarean section over vaginal birth, and risks and consequences were mostly represented reliably. Perceptions about the portrayal of cesarean section showed strong discontent and distrust against providers and the health system, as well as rejection of factual information about the consequences of cesarean section. We documented gross gender inequality and violence against women, highlighting the urgent need for human rights approaches to maternal health to address these inequalities and prevent harmful practices. Our study also contributes to the emerging field of social media analysis, and demonstrates clear areas where social media communication can be improved.

TI  - The use of the nutritional supplements during the covid-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background: COVID-19 causes moderate to severe illness and is spreading globally. During a pandemic, vitamins and minerals are vital to health. Therefore, the prevalence and epidemiology of supplement use in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic must be known. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online survey. The study was con-ducted from June to March 2022 on both adults and children. The link to the survey was shared on social media platforms. The survey included questions on participants' demographics, vaccination status, supplements they used, and side effects of supplements. Participation in this study was optional, and there was no obligation to participate. There was a declaration about the aim of the study and different objectives before starting the survey. Results: The present study reported that most of the participants reported that they used vitamin C (64.6 %), zinc (51.9 %), multivitamins (46.1 %), black seeds (26.7 %), garlic (Allium sativum) (15.4 %), omega-3 (22.1 %), vitamin D (22.2 %), echinacea (10.1 %), manuka honey (26.0 %), curcumin (13.6 %), ginger (22.5 %), royal jelly (12.9 %), and propolis (7.5 %) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. These supplements were used more frequently by subjects during the pandemic than before. Discussion and conclusion: The respondents' risk of these supplements' use may partially reflect the public's behavioral response during a pandemic. Future studies can document the health beliefs and motivations of nutritional supplement users.

TI  - A critical review exploring science communication of nutrition and dietetic research: a case-based approach exploring methodologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS
AB  - BackgroundNutrition is an area of apparent disagreement among the public and experts. It is also an area which has seen a rapid increase in the number of publications in the past 40 years. With the advent of online media and social media platforms, the volume of news has also increased. This review considered five types of nutrition research and how press releases linked to publications might be reported by the media. MethodsExamples were taken from nutrition-related articles published in the areas of in vitro work, animal data, epidemiology, clinical trials and data modelling publications which had press releases deposited in online repositories (EurekAlert! and AlphaGalileo). A critical narrative of the source of the media message, estimates of its reach and any potential exaggeration or source of confusion were identified. ResultsIt was clear that research has been reported by funders, journals and researchers' institutions in ways that claim extended findings of the data beyond that reported in the manuscript. This included inferences of health benefits in humans from laboratory studies, splitting outcome data for the same exposure in epidemiological studies based on perceived public interest, using clinical trials to make media claims that would not be permitted in advertisements and claiming modelled data for cases were actual changes in numbers of cases. ConclusionsIt is essential that funding bodies and institutions along with academic journals apply pressure to discourage exaggeration of research. This is necessary to maintain public trust in science and ultimately improve public health.

TI  - The people <i>vs</i> science: can passively crowdsourced internet data shed light on host-parasite interactions?
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Every internet search query made out of curiosity by anyone who observed something in nature, as well as every photo uploaded to the internet, constitutes a data point of potential use to scientists. Researchers have now begun to exploit the vast online data accumulated through passive crowdsourcing for studies in ecology and epidemiology. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of iParasitology, i.e. the use of internet data for tests of parasitological hypotheses, using hairworms (phylum Nematomorpha) as examples. These large worms are easily noticeable by people in general, and thus likely to generate interest on the internet. First, we show that internet search queries (collated with Google Trends) and photos uploaded to the internet (specifically, to the iNaturalist platform) point to parts of North America with many sightings of hairworms by the public, but few to no records in the scientific literature. Second, we demonstrate that internet searches predict seasonal peaks in hairworm abundance that accurately match scientific data. Finally, photos uploaded to the internet by non-scientists can provide reliable data on the host taxa that hairworms most frequently parasitize, and also identify hosts that appear to have been neglected by scientific studies. Our findings suggest that for any parasite group likely to be noticeable by non-scientists, information accumulating through internet search activity, photo uploads, social media or any other format available online, represents a valuable source of data that can complement traditional scientific data sources in parasitology.

TI  - scikit-mobility: A Python Library for the Analysis, Generation, and Risk Assessment of Mobility Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE
AB  - The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility datasets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records, and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These datasets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical "laws" that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk related to the analysis of mobility datasets.

TI  - Digital Health Engagement in the US Population: Insights From the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives. To examine prevalence and predictors of digital health engagement among the US population. Methods. We analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional data on 7 digital health engagement behaviors, as well as demographic and socioeconomic predictors, from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycle 2, collected in 2018; n = 2698-3504). We fitted multivariable logistic regression models using weighted survey responses to generate population estimates. Results. Digitally seeking health information (70.14%) was relatively common, whereas using health apps (39.53%) and using a digital device to track health metrics (35.37%) or health goal progress (38.99%) were less common. Digitally communicating with one's health care providers (35.58%) was moderate, whereas sharing health data with providers (17.20%) and sharing health information on social media (14.02%) were uncommon. Being female, younger than 65 years, a college graduate, and a smart device owner positively predicted several digital health engagement behaviors (odds ratio range = 0.09-4.21; Conclusions. Many public health goals depend on a digitally engaged populace. These data highlight potential barriers to 7 key digital engagement behaviors that could be targeted for intervention. (Am J Public

TI  - Models of acute care for injured older patients-Australia and New Zealand practice
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB  - Introduction: The epidemiology of injured patients has changed, with an increasing predominance of severe injury and deaths in older (65 years and above) patients after low falls. There is little evidence of the models of care that optimise outcomes for injured older patients. This study aims to describe clinician perspectives of existing models of acute care for injured older patients in Australia and New Zealand.Methods: This cross-sectional online survey of healthcare professionals (HCP) managing injured older patients in Australia or New Zealand hospitals was conducted between November 2nd and December 12th, 2020. Recruitment was via survey link and snowball sampling to professional organisations and special interest groups via email and social media. HCP were asked, using a Likert scale, how likely four typical case vignettes were to be admitted to one of twelve options for ongoing care. Additional questions explored usual care components.Results: Participants (n = 157) were predominantly Australian medical professionals in a major trauma service (MTS) or metropolitan hospital. The most common age defining "geriatric" was aged 65 years and older (43%). HCP described variability in the models and components of acute care for older injured pa-tients in Australia and New Zealand. As a component of care, cognitive, delirium and frailty screening are occurring (60%, 61%, 46%) with HCP from non-major trauma services (non-MTS) reporting frailty and cog-nitive impairment screening more likely to occur in the emergency department (ED). Access to an acute pain service was more likely in a MTS. Participants described poor likelihood of a geriatrician (highest 16%) or physician (highest 12%) review in EDConclusion: Despite a low response rate, HCP in Australia and New Zealand describe variability in acute care pathways for injured older patients. Given the change in epidemiology of injury towards older pa-tients with low force mechanisms, models of acute injury care should be evaluated to define a cost-effective model and components of care that optimise patient-centred outcomes relevant to injured older patients. HCP described some factors they perceive to determine care, and outcomes of variability, offer-ing guidance for future research and resource allocation in the Australia and New Zealand trauma system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pelvic floor symptoms in cisgender women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: an international survey study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction and hypothesis Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders associated with abnormal collagen, and is more prevalent in women than in men. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to characterize pelvic floor symptoms in cisgender women with EDS and to describe their impact on quality of life. Methods An online questionnaire on obstetric and gynecological experiences of cisgender women with EDS was disseminated through EDS patient societies and social media. This study was a sub-analysis of the broader questionnaire and focused on pelvic floor disorders, whereby self-reported symptoms and validated questionnaires were used to assess pelvic floor symptom severity (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, PFDI-20), impact on quality of life (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, PFIQ-7), and sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI-6). Groups based on age and EDS type were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests. Results A total of 1,303 participants were included in the analysis. Pelvic floor symptom prevalence included: stress urinary incontinence in 60%, urgency urinary incontinence in 54%, fecal incontinence in 24%, and pelvic organ prolapse in 21%. Bladder symptoms were reported to be the most bothersome. The impact of prolapse symptoms on quality of life was higher in women under age 40 than in older participants (p<0.001). Pelvic pain was reported in 71%. Pain ratings were highest for dysmenorrhea, muscle and joint pain, and backache (median 7 out of 10 for each). Almost half of participants screened positive for possible sexual dysfunction and 36% reported dyspareunia more than half the time. Conclusions This large, observational study demonstrated that cisgender women with EDS report a high prevalence of pelvic floor symptoms that appear to be more severe than in the general population.

TI  - IoMT: A COVID-19 Healthcare System Driven by Federated Learning and Blockchain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
AB  - Internet of medical things (IoMT) has made it possible to collect applications and medical devices to improve healthcare information technology. Since the advent of the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, public health information has become more sensitive than ever. Moreover, different news items incorporated have resulted in differing public perceptions of COVID-19, especially on the social media platform and infrastructure. In addition, the unprecedented virality and changing nature of COVID-19 makes call centres to be likely overstressed, which is due to a lack of authentic and unregulated public media information. Furthermore, the lack of data privacy has restricted the sharing of COVID-19 information among health institutions. To resolve the above-mentioned limitations, this paper is proposing a privacy infrastructure based on federated learning and blockchain. The proposed infrastructure has the potentials to enhance the trust and authenticity of public media to disseminate COVID-19 information. Also, the proposed infrastructure can effectively provide a shared model while preserving the privacy of data owners. Furthermore, information security and privacy analyses show that the proposed infrastructure is robust against information security-related attacks.

TI  - Protecting the front line: a cross-sectional survey analysis of the occupational factors contributing to healthcare workers' infection and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant occupational stressors and challenges for front-line healthcare workers (HCWs), including COVID-19 exposure risk. Our study sought to assess factors contributing to HCW infection and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Design We conducted a cross sectional survey of HCWs (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), non-clinical staff) during May 2020. Participants completed a 42-item survey assessing disease transmission risk (clinical role, work environment, availability of personal protective equipment) and mental health (anxiety, depression and burn-out). Setting The questionnaire was disseminated over various social media platforms. 3083 respondents from 48 states, the District of Columbia and US territories accessed the survey. Participants Using a convenience sample of HCWs who worked during the pandemic, 3083 respondents accessed the survey and 2040 participants completed at least 80% of the survey. Primary outcome Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 infection, in addition to burn-out, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results Participants were largely from the Northeast and Southern USA, with attending physicians (31.12%), nurses (26.80%), EMTs (13.04%) with emergency medicine department (38.30%) being the most common department and specialty represented. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents met the criteria for being a probable case due to reported COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. HCWs in the emergency department (31.64%) were more likely to contract COVID-19 compared with HCWs in the ICU (23.17%) and inpatient settings (25.53%). HCWs that contracted COVID-19 also reported higher levels of depressive symptoms (mean diff.=0.31; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.47), anxiety symptoms (mean diff.=0.34; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52) and burn-out (mean diff.=0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.71). Conclusion HCWs have experienced significant physical and psychological risk while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the urgent need for increased support for provider physical and mental health well-being.

TI  - Insufficient sleep during adolescence and risk of multiple sclerosis: results from a Swedish case-control study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - BackgroundShift work, which often results in sleep deprivation and circadian desynchrony, has been associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed at studying the impact of sleep duration, circadian disruption and sleep quality on MS risk. MethodsWe used a Swedish population-based case-control study (2075 cases, 3164 controls). Aspects of sleep were associated with MS risk by calculating OR with 95% CIs using logistic regression models. ResultsCompared with sleeping 7-9 hours/night during adolescence, short sleep (<7 hours/night) was associated with increased risk of developing MS (OR 1.4, 95% OR 1.1-1.7). Similarly, subjective low sleep quality during adolescence increased the risk of subsequently developing MS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9), whereas phase shift did not significantly influence the risk. Our findings remained similar when those who worked shifts were excluded. ConclusionsInsufficient sleep and low sleep quality during adolescence seem to increase the risk of subsequently developing MS. Sufficient restorative sleep at young age, needed for adequate immune functioning, may be a preventive factor against MS.

TI  - Violence against girls during COVID-19 pandemic and associated factors in Gondar city, North West Ethiopia
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - In Ethiopia, the magnitude of violence against girls during COVID-19 in the study area is not known. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the violence and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic among Gondar city secondary school girls in North West Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2021. Data were collected from four public and two private Gondar city secondary schools. Investigators used stratified simple random sampling to select participants and the investigators used roster of the students at selected schools. Investigators collected the data using self-reported history of experiencing violence (victimisation). Investigators analysed data using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression. Investigators invited a total of 371 sampled female students to complete self-administered questionnaires. The proportion of girls who experienced violence was 42.05% and psychological violence was the highest form of violence. Having a father who attended informal education (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.08-3.51), ever use of social media 1.65 (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.02-2.69), ever watching sexually explicit material (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36) and use of a substance (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.17-3.15) were significantly associated variables with violence. Almost for every five girls, more than two of them experienced violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prevalence of violence might be under reported due to desirability bias. Therefore, it is better to create awareness towards violence among substance users, fathers with informal education and social media including user females.

A1  - 8th Int Conference Birth Defects
TI  - A consensus statement on birth defects surveillance, prevention, and care in Latin America and the Caribbean
T2  - REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Birth defects contribute up to 21% of the mortality in those under 5 years of age in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and that burden has been compounded by the Zika virus epidemic. In 2001, the March of Dimes launched a series of biennial assemblies called the International Conference on Birth Defects and Disabilities in the Developing World (ICBD). The latest ICBD, in 2017, convened in Bogota, Colombia, and was attended by over 300 professionals, policymakers, and donors. The conference attendees, a majority of whom were from LAC, supported a call to action in the form of a consensus statement. The consensus statement lists key actions for maximizing birth defects surveillance, prevention, and care in LAC: 1) improving surveillance; 2) reducing risks for birth defects; 3) fortifying staple foods; 4) preventing and treating infections associated with birth defects; 5) implementing newborn screening; 6) providing care and services for people with birth defects and disabilities; 7) involving governments, civil society, and international agencies; and 8) advancing research for birth defects. Implementation and scale-up of evidence-based interventions using multisectoral and multidisciplinary collaborative approaches were endorsed. LAC countries can leverage technology and social media to advance and advocate for approaches identified in the consensus statement. The consensus statement can be used as a guide by both governments and nongovernmental agencies to take immediate steps for improving the quality of life of those living with birth defects and associated disabilities in the LAC countries.

A1  - Iberoamer Endometriosis Assoc
TI  - Ibero-American Endometriosis Patient Phenome: Demographics, Obstetric-Gynecologic Traits, and Symptomatology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background: An international collaborative study was conducted to determine the demographic and clinical profiles of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients from Latin America and Spain using the Minimal Clinical Questionnaire developed by the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonization Project (EPHect). Methods: This is a cross-sectional study to collect self-reported data on demographics, lifestyle, and endometriosis symptoms of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients from April 2019 to February 2020. The EPHect Minimal Clinical Questionnaire (EPQ-M) was translated into Spanish. Comprehension and length of the translated survey were assessed by Spanish-speaking women. An electronic link was distributed via social media of endometriosis patient associations from 11 Latin American countries and Spain. Descriptive statistics (frequency, means and SD, percentages, and proportions) and correlations were conducted using SPSSv26. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 1,378 participants from 23 countries; 94.6% had self-reported diagnosis of endometriosis. Diagnostic delay was 6.6 years. Most participants had higher education, private health insurance, and were employed. The most common symptoms were back/leg pain (85.4%) and fatigue (80.7%). The mean number of children was 1.5; 34.4% had miscarriages; the mean length of infertility was 3.7 years; 47.2% reported pregnancy complications. The most common hormone treatment was oral contraceptives (47.0%). The most common comorbidities were migraines (24.1%), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (22.2%), and irritable bowel syndrome (21.1%). Most participants (97.0%) experienced pelvic pain during menses; for 78.7%, pain was severe; 86.4% reported dyspareunia. The mean age of dysmenorrhea onset was 16.2 years (SD +/- 6.1). Hormone treatments were underutilized, while impact was substantial. Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly correlated with pain intensity (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive effort to generate a clinical-demographic profile of Hispanic/Latinx endometriosis patients. Differences in clinical presentation compared to other cohorts included higher prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia and high levels of pain catastrophizing. Though future studies are needed to dissect the impact of race and ethnicity on pain and impact, this profile is the first step to facilitate the recognition of risk factors and diagnostic features and promote improved clinical management of this patient population. The EPHect questionnaire is an efficient tool to capture data to allow comparisons across ethnicities and geographic regions and tackle disparities in endometriosis research.

TI  - Barriers and enablers of implementation of alcohol guidelines with pregnant women: a cross-sectional survey among UK midwives
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB  - BackgroundIn 2016, the UK Chief Medical Officers revised their guidance on alcohol and advised women to abstain from alcohol if pregnant or planning pregnancy. Midwives have a key role in advising women about alcohol during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate UK midwives' practices regarding the 2016 Chief Medical Officers Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy, and factors influencing their implementation during antenatal appointments.MethodsOnline cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of UK midwives recruited through professional networks and social media. Data were gathered using an anonymous online questionnaire addressing knowledge of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines for pregnancy; practice behaviours regarding alcohol assessment and advice; and questions based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to evaluate implementation of advising abstinence at antenatal booking and subsequent antenatal appointments.ResultsOf 842 questionnaire respondents, 58% were aware of the 2016 Alcohol Guidelines of whom 91% (438) cited abstinence was recommended, although 19% (93) cited recommendations from previous guidelines. Nonetheless, 97% of 842 midwives always or usually advised women to abstain from alcohol at the booking appointment, and 38% at subsequent antenatal appointments. Mean TDF domain scores (range 1-7) for advising abstinence at subsequent appointments were highest (indicative of barriers) for social influences (3.65 sd 0.84), beliefs about consequences (3.16 sd 1.13) and beliefs about capabilities (3.03 sd 073); and lowest (indicative of facilitators) for knowledge (1.35 sd 0.73) and professional role and identity (1.46 sd 0.77). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TDF domains: beliefs about capabilities (OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.88), emotion (OR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.67, 0.90), and professional role and identity (OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.51, 0.95) were strong predictors of midwives advising all women to abstain from alcohol at appointments other than at booking.ConclusionsOur results suggest that skill development and reinforcement of support from colleagues and the wider maternity system could support midwives' implementation of alcohol advice at each antenatal appointment, not just at booking could lead to improved outcomes for women and infants. Implementation of alcohol care pathways in maternity settings are beneficial from a lifecourse perspective for women, children, families, and the wider community.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 infections in migrants and the role of household overcrowding: a causal mediation analysis of Virus Watch data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundMigrants are over-represented in SARS-CoV-2 infections globally; however, evidence is limited for migrants in England and Wales. Household overcrowding is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with migrants more likely to live in overcrowded households than UK-born individuals. We aimed to estimate the total effect of migration status on SARS-CoV-2 infection and to what extent household overcrowding mediated this effect. MethodsWe included a subcohort of individuals from the Virus Watch prospective cohort study during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave (1 September 2020-30 April 2021) who were aged & GE;18 years, self-reported the number of rooms in their household and had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection pre-September 2020. We estimated total, indirect and direct effects using Buis' logistic decomposition regression controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, clinical vulnerability, occupation, income and whether they lived with children. ResultsIn total, 23 478 individuals were included. 9.07% (187/2062) of migrants had evidence of infection during the study period vs 6.27% (1342/21 416) of UK-born individuals. Migrants had 22% higher odds of infection during the second wave (total effect; OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.47). Household overcrowding accounted for approximately 36% (95% CI -4% to 77%) of these increased odds (indirect effect, OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12; proportion accounted for: indirect effect on log odds scale/total effect on log odds scale=0.36). ConclusionMigrants had higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave compared with UK-born individuals and household overcrowding explained 36% of these increased odds. Policy interventions to reduce household overcrowding for migrants are needed as part of efforts to tackle health inequalities during the pandemic and beyond.

TI  - A Simulation Study to Explore Inference about Global Moran's <i>I</i> with Random Spatial Indexes
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Inference procedures for spatial autocorrelation statistics assume that the underlying configurations of spatial units are fixed. However, sometimes this assumption can be disadvantageous, for example, when analyzing social media posts or moving objects. This article examines for the case of point geometries how a change from fixed to random spatial indexes affects inferences about global Moran's I, a popular spatial autocorrelation measure. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Matern and Thomas cluster processes are studied and for each of these processes, 10,000 random point patterns are simulated for investigating three aspects that are key in an inferential context: the null distributions of I when the underlying geometries are varied; the effect of the latter on critical values used to reject null hypotheses; and how the presence of point processes affects the statistical power of Moran's I. The results show that point processes affect all three characteristics. Inferences about spatial structure in relevant application contexts may therefore be different from conventional inferences when this additional source of randomness is taken into account.

TI  - Automated Social Text Annotation With Joint Multilabel Attention Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB  - Automated social text annotation is the task of suggesting a set of tags for shared documents on social media platforms. The automated annotation process can reduce users' cognitive overhead in tagging and improve tag management for better search, browsing, and recommendation of documents. It can be formulated as a multilabel classification problem. We propose a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels. The network separately models the title and the content of each document and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each sentence. To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption, which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics. The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN). We conducted a comprehensive evaluation study and compared JMAN to the state-of-the-art baseline models, using four large, real-world social media data sets. In terms of F-1, JMAN significantly outperformed bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) relatively by around 12.8%-78.6% and the hierarchical attention network (HAN) by around 3.9%-23.8%. The JMAN model demonstrates advantages in convergence and training speed. Further improvement of performance was observed against latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). When applying the semantic-based loss regularizers, the performance of HAN and Bi-GRU in terms of F-1 was also boosted. It is also found that dynamic update of the label semantic matrices (JMAN(d)) has the potential to further improve the performance of JMAN but at the cost of substantial memory and warrants further study.

TI  - Ranking by inspiration: a network science approach
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
AB  - Contagion processes have been widely studied in epidemiology and life science in general, but their implications are largely tangible in other research areas, such as in network science and computational social science. Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge, information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors, papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic ranking applications.

TI  - Weight-related Self-monitoring App Use Among Emerging Adults is Cross-sectionally Associated With Amount and Type of Physical Activity and Screen Time
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
AB  - Weight-related self-monitoring (WRSM) apps are often used by emerging adults to assist in behavior change. However, little is known about the relationship between WRSM among the general population of emerging adults and various physical activity and screen time behaviors. This paper examines associations between WRSM app use and various forms of physical activity and screen time among a population-based sample of emerging adults. Data come from EAT 2018 (N = 1,568, mean age = 22.0 +/- 2.0 years), a population-based sample of emerging adults from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants reported on the types of WRSM apps used (physical activity and/or dietary focused), in addition to how much time they spent doing physical activity, whether they practiced yoga, compulsive exercise, recreational screen time, social media use, and whether they viewed dieting/weight loss materials. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess adjusted means and prevalences of outcomes. We found that physical activity-focused WRSM app users engaged in more hours of total (8.7 vs 7.2, P < .001), and moderate-to-vigorous (5.1 vs 4.3, P = .002) physical activity compared to non-users. Similar results were found for dietary WRSM app users compared to non-users. However, WRSM app users had higher levels of compulsive exercise and were more likely to view dieting/weight loss materials (Ps < .001). Findings suggest that although physical activity is higher among WRSM users, the types of physical activity and screen time behaviors WRSM users are engaging in may be harmful.

TI  - The association between information technology sophistication and patient portal use: A cross sectional study in Eastern North Carolina
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - Even with the extolled benefits of patient portals, there has been some challenges to ensuring patient portal use. This study examines if a patient's level of information technology (IT) sophistication, defined as the degree of use of diverse information technologies by an individual, is associated with their use of a patient portal. Patients previous experience and exposure to other similar technologies like desktop computer, laptop, internet, smart phone, or social media explains their willingness to use information technology for their health. Data on a cross-sectional survey of 565 individuals in Eastern NC was available for analysis. Multinomial regression analyses revealed that IT sophistication is important in determining whether patients will use a patient portal. It specifies that patients with low IT sophistication compared to those with high IT sophistication were more likely to have never activated their patient portals (RRR = 2.2155, p < 0.009), or to have activated but never used a patient portal (RRR = 3.5869, p < 0.010). The findings of this study should aid healthcare leaders as they strive to improve patient engagement. They should continue to promote the benefits of the patient portal and consider offering personalized support programs for patients with low IT sophistication.

TI  - The longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' internalizing symptoms, substance use, and digital media use
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The present study examined the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent internalizing symptoms, substance use, and digital media use before and during the pandemic. A nationally representative longitudinal cohort of 3718 Israeli adolescents aged 12-16 at baseline completed measures of internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression, and somatization), the prevalence of substance use (i.e., previous 30-day use of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis), and average daily use of internet/television, video games, and social media. Social support and daily routines were assessed as potential protective factors for mental health. Data were collected in 10 public schools at four measurement points: before the Covid-19 outbreak (September 2019), after the first wave lockdown (May 2020), after the third wave lockdown (May 2021), and after the fifth wave of the pandemic (May 2022). Multi-level mixed models were used to analyze the longitudinal data. The results showed significant increases in internalizing symptoms, substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis), and daily screen time from the start of the study to the 33-month follow-up. Social support and daily routines moderated the increases in internalizing symptoms and digital media use. These findings highlight the need for public and educational mental health services to address the continuing impact of the pandemic on adolescents.

TI  - The psychiatric sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents, adults, and health care workers
T2  - DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic. This study is the first to assess its mental health impact across the lifespan in the United States in adolescents, adults, and health care workers.
   Methods: We recruited 4909 participants through an online survey advertising on Facebook and Instagram to assess exposure to COVID-19 and psychiatric symptoms from April 27 to July 13. We also recruited through the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and grief reactions since COVID-19.
   Results: Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression (55% vs. 29%; chi(2) = 122, df = 1; p < .001), anxiety (48% vs. 29%; chi(2) = 73; df = 1; p < .001), PTSD (45% vs. 33%; chi(2) = 12; df = 1; p < .001), suicidal ideation or behavior (38% vs. 16%; chi(2) = 117; df = 1; p < .001), and sleep problems (69% vs. 57%; chi(2) = 26; df = 1; p < .001) compared to adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost someone to COVID-19 was 55%. Loneliness was the most common predictor across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents.
   Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased rates of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms. Loneliness could put individuals at increased risk for the onset of psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Characterizing the Differences in Descriptions of Violence on Reddit During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - Concerns have been raised over the experiences of violence such as domestic violence (DV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media such as Reddit represent an alternative outlet for reporting experiences of violence where healthcare access has been limited. This study analyzed seven violence-related subreddits to investigate the trends of different violence patterns from January 2018 to February 2022 to enhance the health-service providers' existing service or provide some new perspective for existing violence research. Specifically, we collected violence-related texts from Reddit using keyword searching and identified six major types with supervised machine learning classifiers: DV, IPV, physical violence, sexual violence, emotional violence, and nonspecific violence or others. The increase rate (IR) of each violence type was calculated and temporally compared in five phases of the pandemic. The phases include one pre-pandemic phase (Phase 0, the date before February 26, 2020) and four pandemic phases (Phases 1-4) with separation dates of June 17, 2020, September 7, 2020, and June 4, 2021. We found that the number of IPV-related posts increased most in the earliest phase; however, that for COVID-citing IPV was highest in the mid-pandemic phase. IRs for DV, IPV, and emotional violence also showed increases across all pandemic phases, with IRs of 26.9%, 58.8%, and 28.8%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic to the first pandemic phase. In the other three pandemic phases, all the IRs for these three types of violence were positive, though lower than the IRs in the first pandemic phase. The findings highlight the importance of identifying and providing help to those who suffer from such violent experiences and support the role of social media site monitoring as a means of informative surveillance for help-providing authorities and violence research groups.

TI  - Where did I get dengue? Detecting spatial clusters of infection risk with social network data
T2  - SPATIAL AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Typical spatial disease surveillance systems associate a single address to each disease case reported, usually the residence address. Social network data offers a unique opportunity to obtain information on the spatial movements of individuals as well as their disease status as cases or controls. This provides information to identify visit locations with high risk of infection, even in regions where no one lives such as parks and entertainment zones. We develop two probability models to characterize the high-risk regions. We use a large Twitter dataset from Brazilian users to search for spatial clusters through analysis of the tweets' locations and textual content. We apply our models to both real-world and simulated data, demonstrating the advantage of our models as compared to the usual spatial scan statistic for this type of data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Digital Health Strategies to Fight COVID-19 Worldwide: Challenges, Recommendations, and a Call for Papers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need for coordinated mechanisms to respond to the outbreak across health sectors, and digital health solutions have been identified as promising approaches to address this challenge. This editorial discusses the current situation regarding digital health solutions to fight COVID-19 as well as the challenges and ethical hurdles to broad and long-term implementation of these solutions. To decrease the risk of infection, telemedicine has been used as a successful health care model in both emergency and primary care. Official communication plans should promote facile and diverse channels to inform people about the pandemic and to avoid rumors and reduce threats to public health. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Google Trends analyses are highly beneficial to model pandemic trends as well as to monitor the evolution of patients' symptoms or public reaction to the pandemic over time. However, acceptability of digital solutions may face challenges due to potential conflicts with users' cultural, moral, and religious backgrounds. Digital tools can provide collective public health benefits; however, they may be intrusive and can erode individual freedoms or leave vulnerable populations behind The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the strong potential of various digital health solutions that have been tested during the crisis. More concerted measures should be implemented to ensure that future digital health initiatives will have a greater impact on the epidemic and meet the most strategic needs to ease the life of people who are at the forefront of the crisis.

TI  - Early Warning Diagnostics for Emerging Infectious Diseases in Developing into Late-Stage Pandemics
T2  - ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB  - CONSPECTUS: The spread of infectious diseases due to travel and trade can be seen throughout history, whether from early settlers or traveling businessmen. Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks.SARS, MERS, swine flu, and COVID19.has demonstrated that the causative viruses were circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies chronologically from prehuman predictive technologies to population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally, as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks and pandemics.

TI  - Global Research on Coronaviruses: Metadata-Based Analysis for Public Health Policies
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions. We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories: conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results: Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the United States and China were the primary contributors to global coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policy makers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for effective health responses.

TI  - Water Pipe (Hookah) Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - Tobacco smoking with a water pipe or hookah is increasing globally. There are millions of water pipe tobacco smokers worldwide, and in the United States, water pipe use is more common among youth and young adults than among adults. The spread of water pipe tobacco smoking has been abetted by the marketing of flavored tobacco, a social media environment that promotes water pipe smoking, and misperceptions about the addictive potential and potential adverse health effects of this form of tobacco use. There is growing evidence that water pipe tobacco smoking affects heart rate, blood pressure regulation, baroreflex sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, and vascular function over the short term. Long-term water pipe use is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. Several harmful or potentially harmful substances present in cigarette smoke are also present in water pipe smoke, often at levels exceeding those found in cigarette smoke. Water pipe tobacco smokers have a higher risk of initiation of cigarette smoking than never smokers. Future studies that focus on the long-term adverse health effects of intermittent water pipe tobacco use are critical to strengthen the evidence base and to inform the regulation of water pipe products and use. The objectives of this statement are to describe the design and operation of water pipes and their use patterns, to identify harmful and potentially harmful constituents in water pipe smoke, to document the cardiovascular risks of water pipe use, to review current approaches to water pipe smoking cessation, and to offer guidance to healthcare providers for the identification and treatment of individuals who smoke tobacco using water pipes.

TI  - Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccination Likelihood Among Reproductive-Aged Women in the United States
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
AB  - Objectives: Vaccination for COVID-19 is an effective method of preventing complications; however, studies suggest that public attitudes toward the vaccine are heterogeneous. The objective of our study was to identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January 2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models and controlled for respondents' sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants. Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.02-3.79). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy and concerns may exacerbate existing COVID-19 health disparities in racial and ethnic groups and highlight the need to target messaging to specific populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, because these populations are at high risk for COVID-19 complications.

TI  - Access to mass media and teenage pregnancy among adolescents in Zambia: a national cross-sectional survey
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective Teenage pregnancies and childbirths are associated with negative health outcomes. Access to health information enables adolescents to make appropriate decisions. However, the relationship between access to health information through mass media and teenage pregnancy has not received much attention in existing literature. We therefore examined the association between access to mass media and teenage pregnancy in Zambia. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Zambia. Participants Weighted sample of 3000 adolescents aged 15-19 years. Outcome measure Teenage pregnancy that included adolescents who were currently pregnant or had had an abortion or had given birth in the last 5 years preceding the survey. Results Out of 3000 adolescents, 897 (29.9%, 95% CI: 28.1% to 31.3%) were pregnant or had ever been pregnant. Majority of the adolescents resided in rural areas (55.9%) and had secondary education (53.6%). Adolescents who had exposure to internet, newspapers or magazines, radio and television were 10.5%, 22.6%, 43.1% and 43.1%, respectively. Adolescents who had daily access to newspapers or magazines (adjusted OR (AOR): 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.82) or using internet (AOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.95) were less likely to be pregnant or to have had a pregnancy compared with those with no access to newspapers and internet, respectively. Conclusion Our study suggests that internet use and reading of newspapers or magazines may trigger behavioural change as an effective approach to reducing teenage pregnancy. Behavioural change communicators can implement mass media campaigns using newspapers, magazines and the internet to publicise adolescent health messages that can encourage adolescents to adopt healthy behaviours and prevent teenage pregnancies.

   Results: Mean age of 3052 respondents was 42.1 years old, 83.6% were female and 77.8% provided direct health care to COVID-19 patients. Mean time of use per shift was 6-8 hours in 40.8% of the participants. 28.0% reported never changing it during their shift. Resp use (vs Mask) was more associated with discomfort (58.2% vs 26.8%), affecting task performance (41.5 vs 18.9%) and communication (55.0 vs 40.9%), dyspnea (36.0 vs 14.4%), skin rash (37.5 vs 19.4%) and headache (37.5 vs 19.4%). Frequent user errors included touching the front while in use (70.1% Mask vs 66.3% Resp) and omitting hand hygiene before (61.8% Mask vs 55.0% Resp) or after use (61.3% Mask vs 57.0% Resp). Average number of errors was higher for Mask (4.3), than for Resp (3.2) (all: P <.001).
   Conclusions: Most HCP admitted an extended use of Mask/Resp. Resp were more prone to adverse effects and Mask more prone to errors. Strategies to reinforce good practices should be considered.

TI  - Can technological advancements help to alleviate COVID-19 pandemic? a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing, and the innovative and efficient contributions of the emerging modern technologies to the pandemic responses are too early and cannot be completely quantified at this moment. Digital technologies are not a final solution but are the tools that facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response. In accordance, mobile applications, robots and drones, social media platforms (such as search engines, Twitter, and Facebook), television, and associated technologies deployed in tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak are discussed adequately, emphasizing the current-state-of-art. A collective discussion on reported literature, press releases, and organizational claims are reviewed. This review addresses and highlights how these effective modern technological solutions can aid in healthcare (involving contact tracing, real-time isolation monitoring/ screening, disinfection, quarantine enforcement, syndromic surveillance, and mental health), communication (involving remote assistance, information sharing, and communication support), logistics, tourism, and hospitality. The study discusses the benefits of these digital technologies in curtailing the pandemic and 'how' the different sectors adapted to these in a shorter period. Social media and television's role in ensuring global connectivity and serving as a common platform to share authentic information among the general public were summarized. The World Health Organization and Governments' role globally in-line with the prevention of propagation of false news, spreading awareness, and diminishing the severity of the COVID-19 was discussed. Furthermore, this collective review is helpful to investigators, health departments, Government organizations, and policymakers alike to facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response.

TI  - COVID-19: Guidelines for pharmacists in South Africa
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Since the outbreak of COVID-19, and its declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), the reliance on pharmacists as one of the first points of contact within the healthcare system has been highlighted. This evidence-based review is aimed at providing guidance for pharmacists in community, hospital and other settings in South Africa, on the management of patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. The situation is rapidly evolving, and new evidence continues to emerge on a daily basis. This guidance document takes into account and includes newly available evidence and recommendations, particularly around the following aspects relating to COVID-19:
   Epidemiology
   The virus, its modes of transmission and incubation period
   Symptom identification, including the differentiation between influenza, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis and COVID-19
   Social media myths and misinformation
   Treatment guidelines and medicines that may need to be kept in stock
   Treatment and prevention options, including an update on vaccine development
   The case for and against the use of NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19
   Interventions and patient counselling by the pharmacist.

TI  - Awareness, Perceptions, and Attitude Regarding Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Ophthalmologists in Jordan: Cross-Sectional Online Survey
T2  - CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic is a serious public health concern, and the role of health care workers is essential in preventing spread. The study objective is to investigate awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 and infection control measures among ophthalmologists in Jordan.
   Methods: The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey among Jordanian ophthalmologists. An online survey was sent to 197 ophthalmologists on March 23, 2020. Information on participants' socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of clinical features of COVID-19, risk assessment and infection control measures for preventing disease transmission, and attitude towards treating patients with COVID-19 were collected.
   Results: A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years) responded, 23 (17.6%) had received training on infection control in ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75%), and 38.2% were not provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Most ophthalmologists (79.5%) thought that the virus could be detected in tears, and 72.2% thought that red eye as a symptom of COVID-19.
   Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in Jordan were aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and related infection preventive measures. Knowledge was lacking regarding ocular aspects of the disease. Training on infection prevention needs to be improved. Access to guidelines from international ophthalmological organizations should be promoted and seeking updated literature from peer-reviewed journals needs to be encouraged.

TI  - Role of demographic characteristics in attitude towards cancer prevention some measures in Hail region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - The recent increase in cancer epidemiology in Saudi Arabia might be due to the lack of health education and cancer awareness towards cancer prevention measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess demographic characteristics in attitude towards cancer prevention some measures in the Hail region, Saudi Arabia. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Hail Region, Northern Saudi Arabia, during the period from June 2020 to December 2020. Out of focus on population, 420 individuals have responded. The respondents were included in the study regardless of their age, sex, or other demographical characteristics. For the question "Cancer is a malignant tissue swelling only, not any lesion," 397(94.5%) responded, "Yes." For the question "Any tissue lesion in the body is cancer," 32(7.6%) answered "Yes," included 23/323(7.1%) were males, and 9/97(9.3%) were females. Most participants got their information about cancer from "social media" followed by "When a relative diagnosed with cancer" and Awareness campaign, representing 166/420(39.5%), 142/420(33.8%), and 58/420(13.8%), respectively. For the question "Some food can prevent cancer, and others increase the risk," 201(47.9%) responded "Yes," including 151/323(46.7%) males and 50/97(51.5%) females. About 125(30%) of the participants believe that tobacco smoking cannot cause cancer, including 90/323(27.9%) males and 35/97(36%) females. Conclusion: The Northern Saudi population's demographical characteristics have a strong influence on an individual's attitude towards cancer prevention and control measures. Increased age and education level have a positive impact on a better attitude towards cancer prevention measures.

TI  - Web-Based Health Information-Seeking Methods and Time Since Provider Engagement: Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The use of web-based methods to seek health information is increasing in popularity. As web-based health information (WHI)-seeking affects health-related decision support and chronic symptom self-management, WHI-seeking from online sources may impact health care decisions and outcomes, including care-seeking decisions. Patients who are routinely connected to physicians are more likely to receive better and more consistent care. Little is known about whether WHI-seeking impacts the frequency at which patients engage with health care providers.
   Objective: Our primary objective was to describe the associations between the use of web-based methods to seek information about one's own health and the time since last engaging with a health care provider about one's own health. Additionally, we aimed to assess participants' trust in health care organizations to contextualize our findings.
   Methods: We analyzed data from US adults participating in the nationally representative Tufts Equity in Health, Wealth, and Civic Engagement Survey (N=1034). Bivariate associations between demographic characteristics and health information-seeking methods were assessed with Pearson chi-squared tests. Bivariate associations of Medical Mistrust Index (MMI) scores with each health information-seeking method and time since provider engagement were assessed with F tests and adjusted Wald tests. We fit a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the association between WHI-seeking within the 12 months prior to survey (alone or in combination with provider-based methods versus provider only) and engagement with a provider more than 1 year prior to the time of survey, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, education, insurance coverage, and MMI.
   Results: Age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance source, MMI, and time since provider engagement were each significantly associated with the health information-seeking method in bivariate analyses. Compared to using only provider-based health information seeking methods, WHI-based methods alone or in combination with provider-based methods were associated with a 51% lower likelihood (odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.87) of engaging with a provider within the previous year. Participants who used WHI-seeking methods alone and those who had not engaged with a health care provider within the previous year demonstrated a higher mean MMI score; however, MMI was not a significant predictor of time since engagement with a provider in the multivariable analysis.
   Conclusions: Our findings from a nationally representative survey suggest that for those who use WHI-seeking methods (alone or in combination with provider-based information-seeking methods), there is a statistically significant lower likelihood of engaging with a provider in a year compared to those who only use provider-based methods. Future research should consider the intent of a person's visit with a provider, trust in health care systems, methods of provider engagement, and specific web-based platforms for health information.

TI  - Risk factors, symptom reporting, healthcare-seeking behaviour and adherence to public health guidance: protocol for Virus Watch, a prospective community cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant global mortality and impacted lives around the world. Virus Watch aims to provide evidence on which public health approaches are most likely to be effective in reducing transmission and impact of the virus, and will investigate community incidence, symptom profiles and transmission of COVID-19 in relation to population movement and behaviours. Methods and analysis Virus Watch is a household community cohort study of acute respiratory infections in England and Wales and will run from June 2020 to August 2021. The study aims to recruit 50 000 people, including 12 500 from minority ethnic backgrounds, for an online survey cohort and monthly antibody testing using home fingerprick test kits. Nested within this larger study will be a subcohort of 10 000 individuals, including 3000 people from minority ethnic backgrounds. This cohort of 10 000 people will have full blood serology taken between October 2020 and January 2021 and repeat serology between May 2021 and August 2021. Participants will also post self-administered nasal swabs for PCR assays of SARS-CoV-2 and will follow one of three different PCR testing schedules based on symptoms. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Hampstead National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority Ethics Committee (ethics approval number 20/HRA/2320). We are monitoring participant queries and using these to refine methodology where necessary, and are providing summaries and policy briefings of our preliminary findings to inform public health action by working through our partnerships with our study advisory group, Public Health England, NHS and government scientific advisory panels.

TI  - Distinct clinical phenotypes for Crohn's disease derived from patient surveys
T2  - BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Background Defining clinical phenotypes provides opportunities for new diagnostics and may provide insights into early intervention and disease prevention. There is increasing evidence that patient-derived health data may contain information that complements traditional methods of clinical phenotyping. The utility of these data for defining meaningful phenotypic groups is of great interest because social media and online resources make it possible to query large cohorts of patients with health conditions. Methods We evaluated the degree to which patient-reported categorical data is useful for discovering subclinical phenotypes and evaluated its utility for discovering new measures of disease severity, treatment response and genetic architecture. Specifically, we examined the responses of 1961 patients with inflammatory bowel disease to questionnaires in search of sub-phenotypes. We applied machine learning methods to identify novel subtypes of Crohn's disease and studied their associations with drug responses. Results Using the patients' self-reported information, we identified two subpopulations of Crohn's disease; these subpopulations differ in disease severity, associations with smoking, and genetic transmission patterns. We also identified distinct features of drug response for the two Crohn's disease subtypes. These subtypes show a trend towards differential genotype signatures. Conclusion Our findings suggest that patient-defined data can have unplanned utility for defining disease subtypes and may be useful for guiding treatment approaches.

TI  - SLOfit Lifelong: A model for leveraging citizen science to promote and maintain physical fitness and physical literacy across the lifespan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - SLOfit Lifelong is a public health initiative which was created to upgrade a well-established, national physical fitness surveillance system for Slovenian schoolchildren that has been collecting annual fitness and health data for over three decades. The ultimate objective of creating SLOfit Lifelong was to build a modern societal infrastructure with the capacity and ability to detect future causal associations between childhood physical fitness trends and future health outcomes based on the lifelong surveillance of one's own fitness status. By instilling citizens with an ambition to test, understand, and follow-up their own physical fitness and health status (including related health risk factors), this initiative provides the technical support and expert feedback needed to engender greater individual control over understanding (and thus modulating), one's own physical fitness status as they progress into older adulthood. This perspective paper details the extensive approach taken to devise appropriate fitness test batteries for adults and older adults which can also relate to the student version of the original SLOfit test database, including establishing criterion health risk zones and a public approach to establish this national, citizen-driven health feedback framework. Through its sophisticated online web applications, social media, print media, and outreach workshops, SLOfit Lifelong provides the expert support for public health engagement by fostering positive lifelong physical literacy experiences an individual can enjoy across their aging journey.

TI  - Cell-phone traces reveal infection-associated behavioral change
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Epidemic preparedness depends on our ability to predict the trajectory of an epidemic and the human behavior that drives spread in the event of an outbreak. Changes to behavior during an outbreak limit the reliability of syndromic surveillance using large-scale data sources, such as online social media or search behavior, which could otherwise supplement healthcarebased outbreak-prediction methods. Here, we measure behavior change reflected in mobile-phone call-detail records (CDRs), a source of passively collected real-time behavioral information, using an anonymously linked dataset of cell-phone users and their date of influenza-like illness diagnosis during the 2009 H1N1v pandemic. We demonstrate that mobile-phone use during illness differs measurably from routine behavior: Diagnosed individuals exhibit less movement than normal (1.1 to 1.4 fewer unique tower locations; P < 3.2 x 10(-3)), on average, in the 2 to 4 d around diagnosis and place fewer calls (2.3 to 3.3 fewer calls; P < 5.6 x 10(-4)) while spending longer on the phone (41- to 66-s average increase; P < 4.6 x 10(-10)) than usual on the day following diagnosis. The results suggest that anonymously linked CDRs and health data may be sufficiently granular to augment epidemic surveillance efforts and that infectious disease-modeling efforts lacking explicit behavior-change mechanisms need to be revisited.

TI  - Mapping population vulnerability and community support during COVID-19: a case study from Wales
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)
AB  - Background
   Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose an overwhelming demand on resources that cannot always be met by official organisations. Limited resources and human response to crises can lead members of local communities to turn to one another to fulfil immediate needs. This spontaneous citizen-led response can be crucial to a community's ability to cope in a crisis. It is thus essential to understand the scope of such initiatives so that support can be provided where it is most needed. Nevertheless, quickly developing situations and varying definitions can make the community response challenging to measure.
   Aim
   To create an accessible interactive map of the citizen-led community response to need during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, UK that combines information gathered from multiple data providers to reflect different interpretations of need and support.
   Approach
   We gathered data from a combination of official data providers and community-generated sources to create 14 variables representative of need and support. These variables are derived by a reproducible data pipeline that enables flexible integration of new data. The interactive tool is available online (www.covidresponsemap.wales) and can map available data at two geographic resolutions. Users choose their variables of interest, and interpretation of the map is aided by a linked bee-swarm plot.
   Discussion
   The novel approach we developed enables people at all levels of community response to explore and analyse the distribution of need and support across Wales. While there can be limitations to the accuracy of community-generated data, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used alongside traditional data sources to maximise the understanding of community action. This adds to our overall aim to measure community response and resilience, as well as to make complex population health data accessible to a range of audiences. Future developments include the integration of other factors such as well-being.

TI  - Forecasting National-Level Self-Harm Trends With Social Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Self-harm pertains to actions of self-inflicted poisoning or injury that lead to either non-fatal injuries or death, irrespective of the individual's intention. Self-harm incidents not only cause loss to individuals but also incur a negative impact on the nation's economy. Studies have demonstrated an increase in trends of self-harm that are correlated with the emergence of technological advancements and swift urban expansion in developing countries. The capacity to nowcast and forecast national-level patterns of self-harm trends could be imperative to policymakers and stakeholders in the public health sector, as it would enable them to implement prompt measures to counteract the underlying factors or avert these projected calamities. Prior research has utilized historical data to predict self-harm trends at the population level in various nations using conventional statistical forecasting methods. However, in some countries, such historical statistics may be challenging to obtain or insufficient for accurate prediction, impeding the ability to comprehend and project the national self-harm landscape in a timely manner. This paper proposes FAST, a framework designed to forecast self-harm patterns at the national level by analyzing mental signals obtained from a large volume of social media data. These signals serve as a proxy for real-world population mental health that could be used to enhance the forecastability of self-harm trends. Specifically, language-agnostic language models are first trained to extract different mental signals from collected social media messages. Then, these signals are aggregated and processed into multi-variate time series, on which the time-delay embedding algorithm is applied to transform into temporal embedded instances. Finally, various machine learning regressors are validated for their forecastability. The proposed method is validated through a case study in Thailand, which utilizes a set of 12 mental signals extracted from tweets to forecast death and injury cases resulting from self-harm. The results show that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ARIMA baseline by 43.56% and 36.48% on average in terms of MAPE on forecasting death and injury cases from self-harm, respectively. As far as current understanding permits, our research represents the initial exploration of utilizing aggregated social media information for the purposes of nowcasting and forecasting trends of self-harm on a nationwide scale. The results not only provide insight into improved forecasting techniques for self-harm trends but also establish a foundation for forthcoming social-network-driven applications that hinge on the capacity to predict socioeconomic factors.

TI  - Patterns of Suicide Ideation Across Eight Countries in Four Continents During the COVID-19 Pandemic Era: Repeated Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and countries' response measures have had a globally significant mental health impact. This mental health burden has also been fueled by an infodemic: an information overload that includes misinformation and disinformation. Suicide, the worst mental health outcome, is a serious public health problem that can be prevented with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Suicide ideation, one important risk factor for suicide, is thus important to measure and monitor, as are the factors that may impact on it.
   Objective: This investigation had 2 primary aims: (1) to estimate and compare country-specific prevalence of suicide ideation at 2 different time points, overall and by gender and age groups, and (2) to investigate the influence of sociodemographic and infodemic variables on suicide ideation.
   Methods: A repeated, online, 8-country (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, and New Zealand), cross-sectional study was undertaken with adults aged 18 years, with measurement wave 1 conducted from May 29, 2020 to June 12, 2020 and measurement wave 2 conducted November 6-18, 2021. Self-reported suicide ideation was derived from item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Age-standardized suicide ideation rates were reported, a binomial regression model was used to estimate suicide ideation indication rates for each country and measurement wave, and logistic regression models were then employed to relate sociodemographic, pandemic, and infodemic variables to suicide ideation.
   Results: The final sample totaled 17,833 adults: 8806 (49.4%) from measurement wave 1 and 9027 (50.6%) from wave 2. Overall, 24.2% (2131/8806) and 27.5% (2486/9027) of participants reported suicide ideation at measurement waves 1 and 2, respectively, a difference that was significant (P<.001). Considerable variability was observed in suicide ideation age-standardized rates between countries, ranging from 15.6% in Belgium (wave 1) to 42.9% in Hong Kong (wave 2). Frequent social media usage was associated with increased suicide ideation at wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.25-1.72; P<.001) but not wave 1 (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96-1.23; P=.16). However, having a weaker sense of coherence (SOC; AOR 3.80, 95% CI 3.18-4.55 at wave 1 and AOR 4.39, 95% CI 3.66-5.27 at wave 2; both P<.001) had the largest overall effect size.
   Conclusions: Suicide ideation is prevalent and significantly increasing over time in this COVID-19 pandemic era, with considerable variability between countries. Younger adults and those residing in Hong Kong carried disproportionately higher rates. Social media appears to have an increasingly detrimental association with suicide ideation, although having a stronger SOC had a larger protective effect. Policies and promotion of SOC, together with disseminating health information that explicitly tackles the infodemic's misinformation and disinformation, may importantly reduce the rising mental health morbidity and mortality triggered by this pandemic.

TI  - Sedentary Behaviour and the Social and Physical Environment
T2  - SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Sedentary behaviour is influenced by factors across all levels of the social ecological model. This chapter focuses on the physical and social environmental level of analysis. The chapter summarizes environmental correlates of sedentary behaviour, addresses potential theoretical approaches, and examines the evidence for the effectiveness of environmental interventions on sedentary behaviour. Where relevant, the discussion is separated into young people, adults, and older adults. Some features of the home and workplace have been shown to be associated with sedentary behaviour; however, less is known about influences on sedentary behaviour in other contexts. Theoretical perspectives that may be particularly relevant when considering environmental influences are discussed, including social cognitive theory, habit theory, social network analysis, and systems theory. The theories employed need to try and capture the complex interrelationships between individuals, the groups they operate within and the physical and social context. There is evidence to suggest that incorporating environmental modifications into sedentary behaviour interventions is likely to be effective for both young people and adults.

TI  - Digital Information Technology Use, Self-Rated Health, and Depression: Population-Based Analysis of a Survey Study on Older Migrants
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Previous studies have found that in general, poor health is associated with a lower likelihood of internet use in older adults, but it is not well known how different indicators of health are associated with different types of digital information technology (DIT) use. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between health and the types of DIT use in older ethnic minority and migrant populations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the associations among depressive symptoms and self-rated health (SRH) with different dimensions of DIT use in older migrants.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Care, Health and Ageing of Russian-speaking Minority (CHARM) study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling, Russian-speaking adults aged 50 years or older residing permanently in Finland (men: 616/1082, 56.93%; age: mean 63.2 years, SD 8.4 years; response rate: 1082/3000, 36.07%). Data were collected in 2019 using a postal survey. Health was measured using depressive symptoms (measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and SRH. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the two health indicators and the following six outcomes: daily internet use, smartphone ownership, the use of the internet for messages and calls, social media use, the use of the internet for personal health data, and obtaining health information from the internet. A number of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the logistic regression regression analysis. Analyses were performed with weights accounting for the survey design and nonresponse.
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.37-5.24; P=.004) and poor SRH (OR 7.90, 95% CI 1.88-33.11; P=.005) were associated with a higher likelihood of not using the internet daily. Depressive symptoms (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35; P=.03) and poor SRH (OR 5.05, 95% CI 1.58-16.19; P=.006) also increased the likelihood of smartphone nonuse. Depressive symptoms were additionally associated with a lower likelihood of social media use, and poor SRH was associated with a lower likelihood of using the internet for messaging and calling.
   Conclusions: Poor SRH and depressive symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of DIT use in older adults. Longitudinal studies are required to determine the directions of these relationships.

TI  - Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study
T2  - LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.
   Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.
   Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0.0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5.2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
   Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

TI  - Space-Time Dependence of Emotions on Twitter after a Natural Disaster
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Natural disasters can have significant consequences for population mental health. Using a digital spatial epidemiologic approach, this study documents emotional changes over space and time in the context of a large-scale disaster. Our aims were to (a) explore the spatial distribution of negative emotional expressions of Twitter users before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy in New York City (NYC) in 2012 and (b) examine potential correlations between socioeconomic status and infrastructural damage with negative emotional expressions across NYC census tracts over time. A total of 984,311 geo-referenced tweets with negative basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame) were collected and assigned to the census tracts within NYC boroughs between 8 October and 18 November 2012. Global and local univariate and bivariate Moran's I statistics were used to analyze the data. We found local spatial clusters of all negative emotions over all disaster periods. Socioeconomic status and infrastructural damage were predominantly correlated with disgust, fear, and shame post-disaster. We identified spatial clusters of emotional reactions during and in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster that could help provide guidance about where immediate and long-term relief measures are needed the most, if transferred to similar events and on comparable data worldwide.

TI  - Fiction, Falsehoods, and Few Facts: Cross-Sectional Study on the Content-Related Quality of Atopic Eczema-Related Videos on YouTube
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In recent years, YouTube has become a recognized source of medical information for health care consumers. Although YouTube has advantages in this context, there are potential dangers as videos may contain nonscientific, misleading, or even harmful information.
   Objective: As little is known about YouTube as a source of information on atopic dermatitis (AD), we investigated the content-related quality of AD videos and their perception among YouTube users.
   Methods: The quality of the 100 most viewed AD videos was assessed by using the Global Quality Scale (GQS) and the DISCERN instrument. Videos were classified as "useful," "misleading," and "potentially harmful," and the correlations of viewers' ratings (likes) with the GQS and DISCERN scores were assessed.
   Results: Among the 100 videos, 68.0% (68/100) and 62.0% (62/100) were of poor and very poor scientific quality, respectively. Additionally, 32.0% (32/100) of the videos were classified as useful, 48.0% (48/100) were classified as misleading, and 34.0% (34/100) were classified as potentially harmful. Viewers' ratings did not correlate with the GQS and DISCERN scores. Overall, 50.0% (50/100) of the videos were posted by private individuals and promoters of complementary/alternative treatments, 42.0% (42/100) by therapeutical advertisers, and only 8.0% (8/100) by nonprofit organizations/universities.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that two-thirds of the videos analyzed were below acceptable medical quality standards and that many videos were disseminating misleading or even dangerous content. Subjective and anecdotal content was over-represented, and viewers did not appear to be able to distinguish between high- and low-quality videos. Health promotion strategies by professional medical organizations are needed to improve their presence and visibility on YouTube.

TI  - The awareness of neglected tropical diseases in a sample of medical and nursing students in Cairo University, Egypt: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of chronic diseases affecting 1.2 billion people worldwide, with more burden in the developing communities. Improving awareness about NTDs is a powerful affordable long-term intervention for infection control. In literature, there is a limited number of studies in the developing countries assessing the awareness of healthcare providers regarding these diseases. The present study aimed at assessing the awareness of a sample of Cairo University medical and nursing students regarding NTDs. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 184 medical and nursing students in Cairo University. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire in English language with an estimated completion time of 15 minutes was used for evaluation. It included question categories which cover the knowledge about NTDs and control measures as well as the willingness to participate in NTDs control activities. Content analysis was performed on the materials and specifications of the epidemiology course given to medical and nursing students. Out of the study participants, 26% knew the meaning of NTDs. The main source of their knowledge was social media followed by the epidemiology course. A percentage of 33% of the students agreed that NTDs are of public health importance in Egypt. Thirty four percent of the participants expressed their willingness to participate in control activities for NTDs. Comparing medical and nursing students, a higher percentage of the nursing students stated that NTDs are causing a public health problem in Egypt with a statistically significant difference (P value < 0.001), while a statistically significant higher percentage of medical students believed that the awareness level regarding NTDs in Egypt is low (P value = 0.002). Cairo University medical and nursing students in this study showed a gap in the level of knowledge regarding NTDs and their control activities which represents a great threat to the control of these diseases.
   Author summary
   Egypt vision 2030 aiming that all Egyptians should have healthy, safe, and secure life. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Egypt has the highest rate of NTDs. Current medical and nursing students are the future healthcare workers who will be responsible to participate in control activities for the elimination of these diseases in Egypt. The present study aimed to provide information about the awareness of medical and nursing students regarding NTDs and their control activities. We targeted medical and nursing students who have finished an epidemiology course. Our results showed that only one fourth of the students knew the meaning of NTDs and nearly half of them agreed that the awareness of NTDs is poor among Egyptians. Although only 5% of the included students are aware of NTDs control activities, about one third of them agreed to participate in these activities. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to update the curricula of medical students in Egypt, especially because of the new program the medical schools in Egypt are experiencing currently (five years of studying and two years for training). Also, the engagement of medical and nursing students in research and prevention activities to combat NTDs should be encouraged in the training years.

TI  - Treatment options in idiopathic subglottic stenosis: protocol for a prospective international multicentre pragmatic trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is an unexplained progressive obstruction of the upper airway that occurs almost exclusively in adult, Caucasian women. The disease is characterised by mucosal inflammation and localised fibrosis resulting in life-threatening blockage of the upper airway. Because of high recurrence rates, patients with iSGS will frequently require multiple procedures following their initial diagnosis. Both the disease and its therapies profoundly affect patients' ability to breathe, communicate and swallow. A variety of treatments have been advanced to manage this condition. However, comparative data on effectiveness and side effects of the unique approaches have never been systematically evaluated. This study will create an international, multi-institutional prospective cohort of patients with iSGS. It will compare three surgical approaches to determine how well the most commonly used treatments in iSGS 'work' and what quality of life (QOL) trade-offs are associated with each approach.
   Methods and analysis A prospective pragmatic trial comparing the 'Standard of Care' for iSGS at multiple international institutions. Patients with a diagnosis of iSGS without clinical or laboratory evidence of vasculitis or a history of endotracheal intubation 2 years prior to symptom onset will be included in the study. Prospective evaluation of disease recurrence requiring operative intervention, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as well as patient-generated health data (mobile peak flow recordings and daily steps taken) will be longitudinally tracked for 36 months. The primary endpoint is treatment effectiveness defined as time to recurrent operative procedure. Secondary endpoints relate to treatment side effects and include PRO measures in voice, swallowing, breathing and global QOL as well as patient-generated health data.
   Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the local IRB Committee of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in July 2015. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and directly to patient with iSGS via social media-based support groups.

TI  - YouTube as a source of information in retinopathy of prematurity
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Aim We aimed to evaluate the quality of information available on YouTube regarding the basic information, examination, diagnosis, and the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
   Methods A YouTube search was performed on https://www.youtube.com/for videos pertaining to "retinopathy of prematurity" and "ROP." The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. Two ophthalmologist reviewers independently evaluated and classified the videos as useful or misleading. The videos were accepted as "useful," if they provide scientifically correct information about any aspect of ROP: cause, pathogenesis, symptoms, findings, treatments, procedure details of the treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis. The videos contain scientifically unproven information are defined as "misleading." Videos were also classified according to the source: surgeon/practitioner, independent user, hospital/free clinic, social media/TV, medical site, university, and advertisement.
   Results The mean duration, the mean days on YouTube, the mean comments per videos, and the mean dislikes per video were similar in useful and misleading videos. However, the mean likes per day, mean view per video, and mean view per day were significantly higher in useful videos than those of misleading videos (p = 0.004, p = 0.022, and p = 0.011, respectively). Most of the useful videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals including source from university, hospital/free clinic, and surgeon/practitioner (48/64). The videos uploaded by healthcare professionals were more useful compared to those of non-healthcare professionals (p = 0.029).
   Conclusion YouTube could be used as an important tool for patient information in ROP. However, one third of the YouTube videos regarding ROP are misleading and may present a risk of harmful consequences. In this aspect, authoritative videos by healthcare professionals should be uploaded for dissemination of reliable information on ROP.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes, practices, and their associated factors against the growing threat of COVID-19 among medical students
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Coronavirusdiseasese 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world deeply. Successfully control and minimization of related morbidity and mortality require changing the behavior, which is influenced by knowledge and perceptions. This study aimed to explore the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of medical students (MS) regarding COVID-19 and to identify their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 431 ungraduated MS was conducted in Sfax Medical School, Southern Tunisia, in November 2020. Results: The global scores of COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice among MS were 74.6 +/- 13, 69 +/- 10.2, and 78.8 +/- 13.6/100, respectively. Prevalence of good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice was 47.1%, 19.3%, and 61.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the independent factors of good knowledge were current smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.8; p=0.04), assistance to training sessions (AOR=1.5; p=0.04) and specialized residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.02). History of chronic disease was an independant predictor of positive attitude (AOR=2.4; p=0.009), while current smoking (AOR=0.4; p=0.01) wasindependantly associated with negative attitude. Social media used as a main source of information about COVID-19 was independently associated with poor knowledge (AOR=0.5; p=0.01) and negative attitude (AOR=0.4; p=0.008). Independant factors of good practice were specialized residency education level (AOR=2.4; p=0.01), being in close contact exposure with COVID-19 cases (AOR= 2.1; p=0.04) and having good knowledge (AOR=2.2; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Tunisian MS had satisfactory knowledge and practice about COVID-19, butthey had lower positive attitude rates towards this emergent disease. Thus, development of interactive courses on emerging diseases and travel epidemiology are higly recommended.

TI  - Nurses' attitudes regarding the importance of families in nursing care: A cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and objectives To investigate attitudes towards family involvement in care among a broad sample of Danish nurses from all sectors and healthcare settings.
   Background Evidence suggests that nurses hold both supportive and less supportive attitudes about involvement of family members in the care of patients, and the existing findings are limited to specific healthcare contexts.
   Design A cross-sectional study adhering to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for reporting observational studies.
   Methods Using snowball sampling, the Families' Importance in Nursing Care-Nurses' Attitudes questionnaire was initially administered to a broad, convenience sample of Danish registered nurses through social media: Facebook interest groups and the homepage of the Danish Family Nursing Association. These nurses were encouraged to send the invitation to participate in their network of nursing colleagues. Complete data sets from 1,720 nurses were available for analysis.
   Results In general, the nurses considered the family as important in patient care. Nurses who held master's and doctorate degrees scored significantly higher than nurses with a basic nursing education. Nurses who had had experience with illness within their own families tended to score higher on the family as a conversational partner subscale than those without this experience. Nurses with the longest engagement within hospital settings scored significantly lower than those with the longest engagement within primary health care and/or psychiatry.
   Conclusions Families are considered important in nursing care. Younger nurses with a basic education, short-term engagement at a hospital and no experiences with illness within their own families were predictors of less supportive attitudes towards including the family in nursing care.
   Relevance to clinical practice Clinical leaders and managers should promote education on the importance of active family involvement in patient care in clinical practice and undergraduate education. More focus on collaboration with families in the hospital setting is needed.

TI  - Improving social justice in observational studies: protocol for the development of a global and Indigenous STROBE-equity reporting guideline
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundAddressing persistent and pervasive health inequities is a global moral imperative, which has been highlighted and magnified by the societal and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Observational studies can aid our understanding of the impact of health and structural oppression based on the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity, age and other factors, as they frequently collect this data. However, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline, does not provide guidance related to reporting of health equity. The goal of this project is to develop a STROBE-Equity reporting guideline extension.MethodsWe assembled a diverse team across multiple domains, including gender, age, ethnicity, Indigenous background, disciplines, geographies, lived experience of health inequity and decision-making organizations. Using an inclusive, integrated knowledge translation approach, we will implement a five-phase plan which will include: (1) assessing the reporting of health equity in published observational studies, (2) seeking wide international feedback on items to improve reporting of health equity, (3) establishing consensus amongst knowledge users and researchers, (4) evaluating in partnership with Indigenous contributors the relevance to Indigenous peoples who have globally experienced the oppressive legacy of colonization, and (5) widely disseminating and seeking endorsement from relevant knowledge users. We will seek input from external collaborators using social media, mailing lists and other communication channels.DiscussionAchieving global imperatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDG 10 Reduced inequalities, SDG 3 Good health and wellbeing) requires advancing health equity in research. The implementation of the STROBE-Equity guidelines will enable a better awareness and understanding of health inequities through better reporting. We will broadly disseminate the reporting guideline with tools to enable adoption and use by journal editors, authors, and funding agencies, using diverse strategies tailored to specific audiences.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in sub-Saharan Africa: a protocol of a prospective registry with a nested case-control study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly documented. We have started a registry to determine the burden, phenotype, risk factors, disease course and outcomes of IBD in Zimbabwe.
   Methods and analysis A prospective observational registry with a nested case-control study has been established at a tertiary hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. The registry is recruiting confirmed IBD cases from the hospital, and other facilities throughout Zimbabwe. Demographic and clinical data are obtained at baseline, 6 months and annually. Two age and sex-matched non-IBD controls per case are recruited-a sibling or second-degree relative, and a randomly selected individual from the same neighbourhood. Cases and controls are interviewed for potential risk factors of IBD, and dietary intake using a food frequency questionnaire. Stool is collected for 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling, and along with germline DNA from peripheral blood, is being biobanked. The estimated sample size is 86 cases and 172 controls, and the overall registry is anticipated to run for at least 5 years. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographic and phenotypic characteristics of IBD, and incidence and prevalence will be estimated for Harare. Risk factors for IBD will be analysed using conditional logistic regression. For microbial analysis, alpha diversity and beta diversity will be compared between cases and controls, and between IBD phenotypes. Mann-Whitney U tests for alpha diversity and Adonis (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) for beta diversity will be computed.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Parirenyatwa Hospital's and University of Zimbabwe's research ethics committee and the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe. Findings will be discussed with patients, and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health. Results will be presented at scientific meetings, published in peer reviewed journals, and on social media.

TI  - Run4Love, a mHealth (WeChat-based) intervention to improve mental health of people living with HIV: a randomized controlled trial protocol
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: People living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from high rates of mental illness; but targeted effective interventions are limited, especially in developing countries. High penetration of smartphone usage and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in PLWH in China.
   Methods: A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects.
   Discussion: The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective, Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic diseases.

TI  - Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies on Online/Digital/Internet-Mediated Alcohol Marketing: a Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundThe rapid growth of social networking sites and video sharing platforms has created an opportunity for the alcohol industry to employ advanced advertising and marketing approaches to target their audiences, increasingly blurring the lines between commercial marketing and user-generated content, which poses a challenge for effective regulation.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search through three peer-reviewed journal databases (WoS, PubMed, Scopus). Studies were included if published in English, after 2004, and assessed statutory regulation or voluntary industry codes, enacted by an EU or nation's governmental agency or private entity, and with the intent to restrict digital alcohol advertising. In addition, we conducted a manual search of gray literature.ResultsA total of 4690 records were identified. After duplicate removal and full-text assessment, 14 articles were examined. Our findings indicate that children and adolescents may often be exposed to alcohol advertisements on social media and websites due to industry's self-regulatory age-affirmation systems being largely ineffective at preventing under-aged access. Cases of self-regulatory violations by the alcohol industry, and increasingly innovative 'gray-area' advertising approaches have also been noted. Additionally, research illustrates a lack of developed statutory restrictions of digital alcohol advertising and instead continued reliance on voluntary industry self-regulation.ConclusionsThere is a substantial need for further research to examine the effectiveness of digital alcohol advertising restrictions in social media, websites and image/video sharing platforms. Moreover, there is a necessity for countries to develop comprehensive statutory frameworks, which would effectively restrict and monitor rapidly advancing digital alcohol advertising practices on new digital media.

TI  - Does medical humanities matter? The challenge of COVID-19
T2  - MEDICAL HUMANITIES
AB  - Medical humanities has tended first and foremost to be associated with the ways in which the arts and humanities help us to understand health. However, this is not the only or necessarily the primary aim of our field. What the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed above all is what the field of critical medical humanities has insisted on: the deep entanglement of social, cultural, historical life with the biomedical. The pandemic has been a time for reinstating the power of expertise of a particular kind, focusing on epidemiology, scientific modelling of potential outcomes and vaccine development. All of this delivered by science at speed.It has been challenging for medical humanities researchers to find purchase in these debates with insights from our more contemplative, 'slow research' approaches. However, as the height of the crisis passes, our field might now be coming into its own. The pandemic, as well as being productive of scientific expertise, also demonstrated clearly the meaning of culture: that it is not a static entity, but is produced and evolves through interaction and relationship. Taking a longer view, we can see the emergence of a certain 'COVID-19 culture' characterised by entanglements between expert knowledge, social media, the economy, educational progress, risk to health services and people in their socio-economic, political ethnic and religious/spiritual contexts. It is the role of medical humanities to pay attention to those interactions and to examine how they play out in the human experience and potential impact of the pandemic. However, to survive and grow in significance within the field of healthcare research, we need to engage not just to comment. There is a need for medical humanities scholars to assert our expertise in interdisciplinary research, fully engaged with experts by experience, and to work proactively with funders to demonstrate our value.

TI  - ARTCDP: An automated data platform for monitoring emerging patterns concerning road traffic crashes in China
T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB  - Online media reports provide valuable information for road traffic injury prevention, but technical challenges concerning data acquisition and processing limit analysis and interpretation of such data. Integrating injury epidemiology theory and big data technology, we developed a data platform consisting of four layers (data acquisition, data processing, application and data storage) to automatically collect reports from online Chinese media concerning road traffic crashes every 24 h. We built a text classification model using 20,000 manually annotated news stories based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and then used natural language processing algorithms to extract data concerning 27 structured variables from the news sources. The accuracy of the BERT-based text classification model was 0.9271, with information extraction accuracy exceeding 80% for 22 variables. As of November 30, 2021, the data platform collected 244,650 eligible media reports covering all 333 prefecture-level divisions in China. These reports were from 37,073 websites or social media accounts, which were geographically located in all 31 provinces and over 98% of prefecture-level divisions. Data availability varied greatly from 0.9% to 100% across the 27 structured variables. Additionally, the platform identified 645,787 potentially relevant keywords when applying natural language processing techniques to the textual media reports. Platform data were highly correlated with road police data in province-based road traffic crash statistics (crashes, r(s) = 0.799; non-fatal injuries, r(s) = 0.802; deaths, r(s) = 0.775). In particular, the platform offers valuable data (like crashes involving electric vehicles) that are not included in official mad traffic crash statistics. The new automated data platform shows great potential for timely detection of emerging characteristics of mad traffic crashes. Further research is needed to improve the platform and apply it to real-time monitoring and analysis of road traffic injuries.

TI  - Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Dry Eye Disease Among Children and Adults in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by loss of homeostasis of the tear film or failure to produce sufficient amounts of tears to moisturize the eyes. The condition has been associated with several preventable risk factors.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to calculate the prevalence of dry eye and determine the associated risk factors among adults and children in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study targeting all Saudi populations, including all the regions of Saudi Arabia. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the five-item Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ-5) were used for data collection. Data were collected using an online form that was distributed through social media.
   Results: A total of 541 responses were analyzed. The OSDI scores showed that females represented 70.9%, and the age group of 20-40 years represented 59.7%. The prevalence of DED, including all severity levels, was 74.9%. The distribution across levels was as follows: mild cases at 26.2%, moderate cases at 18.2%, and severe at 30.4%. On the other hand, DEQ-5 has shown a prevalence of 37% among the pediatric age group. Several risk factors have been significantly associated with adults' dry eye, including low humidity (Pvalue=0.002), reading, driving, or watching electronic screens for extended durations (P-value=0.019), autoimmune diseases (P-value=0.033), and undergoing eye procedures (P-value-0.013).
   Conclusion: The current study reports a high prevalence rate of dry eyes among the Saudi population. Reading, driving, and using electronic screens for an extended period were found to be associated with the severity of DED. Prospective studies should focus on the epidemiology of the disease, which will provide evidence for better preventive and therapeutic measures.

TI  - Depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: The outbreak of coronavirus posits deleterious consequences on global healthcare system while affecting human life in every aspect. Despite several measures undertaken to limit the socio-economic effect of coronavirus, various challenges remain pervasive, and one such challenge is mental health, particularly depression and anxiety. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of COVID-19.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out via social media platforms and 1544 Malaysians were selected. The level of depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9) and scored accordingly for categorization. Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used as a self-assessment survey to quantify the level of anxiety of persons experiencing anxiety-related symptoms. Percentage distribution and logistic regression analysis were used in the data analysis.
   Results: Results showed that one-fourth (25.1%) of the participants had severe depressive symptoms. Almost one sixth (18.7%) had mild depressive symptoms and one-third (34.1%) had mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. Age, gender, and friends infected with virus were the three important predictors of depression and anxiety. The odds of having depression (OR = 1.44; C.I. = 1.32-1.62) and anxiety (OR = 1.36; C.I. = 1.27-1.47) were significantly higher among females than in males.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of the study participants were facing mild to severe depression and anxiety symptoms which is very alarming as the pandemic is still now increasing across the country. Immediate interventions including community counselling programmes, TV and social media campaigns are urgently needed to reduce the psychological stress among the Malaysian population.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Determinants of Acceptance among Healthcare Workers, Academics and Tertiary Students in Nigeria
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of human deaths, prompting the rapid development and regulatory approval of several vaccines. Although Nigeria implemented a COVID-19 vaccination program on 15 March 2021, low vaccine acceptance remains a major challenge. To provide insight on factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), we conducted a national survey among healthcare workers, academics, and tertiary students, between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2021. We fitted a logistic regression model to the data and examined factors associated with VH to support targeted health awareness campaigns to address public concerns and improve vaccination rates on par with global efforts. A total of 1525 respondents took part in the survey, composed of healthcare-workers (24.5%, 373/1525), academics (26.9%, 410/1525), and students (48.7%, 742/1525). Only 29% (446/1525) of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of this study. Of the 446 vaccinated respondents, 35.7% (159/446), 61.4% (274/446) and 2.9% (13/446) had one, two and three or more doses, respectively. Reasons for VH included: difficulty in the vaccination request/registration protocols (21.3%, 633/1079); bad feelings towards the vaccines due to negative social media reports/rumours (21.3%, 633/1079); personal ideology/religious beliefs against vaccination (16.7%, 495/1079); and poor confidence that preventive measures were enough to protect against COVID-19 (11%, 323/1079). Some health concerns that deterred unvaccinated respondents were: innate immunity issues (27.7%, 345/1079); allergic reaction concerns (24.6%, 307/1079); and blood clot problems in women (21.4%, 266/1079). In the multivariable model, location of respondents/geopolitical zones, level of education, testing for COVID-19, occupation/job description and religion were significantly associated with VH. Findings from this study underscore the need for targeted awareness creation to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Nigeria and elsewhere. Besides professionals, similar studies are recommended in the general population to develop appropriate public health interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

TI  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with onset witnessed by emergency medical services: Implications for improvement in overall survival
T2  - RESUSCITATION
AB  - Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major public health problem. Even in high-income countries, survival rates have plateaued in the range of ten percent, stimulating an ongoing interest in developing novel approaches to resuscitation. Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-witnessed OHCAs constitute a subgroup of overall OHCA that occur after the arrival of EMS, leading to rapid initiation of resuscitation and significantly improved survival. In this narrative review we summarize and interpret recent developments in knowledge of EMS-witnessed OHCA regarding prevalence, demographics, location, circumstances, survival outcomes and clinical profile. We examine the possibility of informing novel resuscitation approaches and enhancing mechanistic knowledge by studying EMS-witnessed OHCA, with the goal of improving overall survival from OHCA.

TI  - Perceptions of Mental Health and Exploring the Role of Social Activism Among African Americans Exposed to Media Coverage of Police Brutality and Protests
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
AB  - This study explored the role of social activism in the association of exposure to media coverage of police brutality and protests with perceptions of mental health. Data for this study came from a sample of African Americans (N = 304) who responded to an online survey. Perceptions of mental health were assessed using a single item developed by the research team. Exposure to police brutality and protests was measured by asking how often they had seen or heard about African Americans being victims of police brutality and seen or heard about protests on television, social media, or other outlets. Participants were also asked about the extent to which these events caused them emotional distress. Social activism was assessed by asking participants if they had ever participated in political activities, such as calling their representative. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted using linear regression. Moderation analyses showed that greater emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and protests was associated with worse perceptions of mental health only when engagement in social activism was low. In contrast, mediation analyses indicated that greater frequency of and emotional distress from exposure to media coverage was indirectly associated with worse perceptions of mental health through increased engagement in social activism. Social activism may be an important method for coping with emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and protests, but more research is needed to understand how African Americans might engage in social activism without adversely impacting mental health.

TI  - Which are the vital factors of mobile personal health records applications that promote continued usage? A perspective on technology fit and social capital
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - IntroductionWith the widespread use of mobile devices and the rapid development of mobile networks, connecting mobile personal health record (mPHR) apps to wearable devices to collect personal health data for analysis and community activities has become a trend for health promotion. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the vital factors that impact the sustained usage of mPHR apps. ObjectiveIn this study, we identified social lock-in as a major research gap in the current era of social media and the Internet. Therefore, to explore the effects of mPHR apps on continued app usage intention, we combined technology fit (individual-technology, synchronicity-technology, and task-technology fit) and social capital (structural, relational, and cognitive capital) to develop a novel study model. MethodsThe purpose of this research is to investigate the willingness to participate in the mPHR apps. It collected 565 valid users' responses through the online questionnaire with a structural equation modeling approach. ResultsThat technology and social lock-in significantly affected the willingness of users to continue using mPHR apps (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) and that the effects of social lock-in (beta = 0.38, P < 0.001) were more pronounced than those of technology lock-in (beta = 0.22, P < 0.001). ConclusionsThe technology and social lock-in generated by technology fit and social capital had positive effects on continued app usage and the effects of both types of lock-in on continued app usage varied among different participant groups.

TI  - Cohort profile: the Food Chain Plus (FoCus) cohort
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - The Food Chain Plus (FoCus) cohort was launched in 2011 for population-based research related to metabolic inflammation. To characterize this novel pathology in a comprehensive manner, data collection included multiple omics layers such as phenomics, microbiomics, metabolomics, genomics, and metagenomics as well as nutrition profiling, taste perception phenotyping and social network analysis. The cohort was set-up to represent a Northern German population of the Kiel region. Two-step recruitment included the randomised enrolment of participants via residents' registration offices and via the Obesity Outpatient Centre of the University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH). Hence, both a population- and metabolic inflammation- based cohort was created. In total, 1795 individuals were analysed at baseline. Baseline data collection took place between 2011 and 2014, including 63% females and 37% males with an age range of 18-83 years. The median age of all participants was 52.0 years [IQR: 42.5; 63.0 years] and the median baseline BMI in the study population was 27.7 kg/m(2) [IQR: 23.7; 35.9 kg/m(2)]. In the baseline cohort, 14.1% of participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was more prevalent in the subjects of the metabolic inflammation group (MIG; 31.8%). Follow-up for the assessment of disease progression, as well as the onset of new diseases with changes in subject's phenotype, diet or lifestyle factors is planned every 5 years. The first follow-up period was finished in 2020 and included 820 subjects.

TI  - Societal costs of multiple sclerosis in Ireland
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Aims: This paper evaluates the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Ireland, and estimates the associated direct, indirect, and intangible costs to society based on a large nationally representative sample.
   Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed to capture the demographics, disease characteristics, healthcare use, informal care, employment, and wellbeing. Referencing international studies, standardized survey instruments were included (e.g. CSRI, MFIS-5, EQ-5D) or adapted (EDSS) for inclusion in an online survey platform. Recruitment was directed at people with MS via the MS Society mailing list and social media platforms, as well as in traditional media. The economic costing was primarily conducted using a bottom-up' methodology, and national estimates were achieved using prevalence-based' extrapolation.
   Results: A total of 594 people completed the survey in full. The sample had geographic, disease, and demographic characteristics indicating good representativeness. At an individual level, average societal cost was estimated at (sic)47,683; the average annual costs for those with mild, moderate, and severe MS were calculated as (sic)34,942, (sic)57,857, and (sic)100,554, respectively. For a total Irish MS population of 9,000, the total societal costs of MS amounted to (sic)429m. Direct costs accounted for just 30% of the total societal costs, indirect costs amounted to 50% of the total, and intangible or QoL costs represented 20%. The societal cost associated with a relapse in the sample is estimated as (sic)2,438.
   Limitations and conclusions: The findings highlight that up to 70% of the total costs associated with MS are not routinely counted. These hidden costs are higher in Ireland than the rest of Europe, due in part to significantly lower levels of workforce participation, a higher likelihood of permanent workforce withdrawal, and higher levels of informal care needs. The relationship between disease progression and costs emphasize the societal importance of managing and slowing the progression of the illness.

TI  - Occupation, work-related contact and SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid serological status: findings from the Virus Watch prospective cohort study
T2  - OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies across occupations; however, investigation into factors underlying differential risk is limited. We aimed to estimate the total effect of occupation on SARS-CoV-2 serological status, whether this is mediated by workplace close contact, and how exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces varied across occupations. Methods We used data from a subcohort (n=3775) of adults in the UK-based Virus Watch cohort study who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (indicating natural infection). We used logistic decomposition to investigate the relationship between occupation, contact and seropositivity, and logistic regression to investigate exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces. Results Seropositivity was 17.1% among workers with daily close contact vs 10.0% for those with no work-related close contact. Compared with other professional occupations, healthcare, indoor trade/process/plant, leisure/personal service, and transport/mobile machine workers had elevated adjusted total odds of seropositivity (1.80 (1.03 to 3.14) - 2.46 (1.82 to 3.33)). Work-related contact accounted for a variable part of increased odds across occupations (1.04 (1.01 to 1.08) - 1.23 (1.09 to 1.40)). Occupations with raised odds of infection after accounting for work-related contact also had greater exposure to poorly ventilated workplaces. Conclusions Work-related close contact appears to contribute to occupational variation in seropositivity. Reducing contact in workplaces is an important COVID-19 control measure.

TI  - Gynecological concerns and vaginal practices and exposures among transfeminine individuals who have undergone vaginoplasty
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Vaginoplasty is a gender-affirming surgery that is medically necessary for some transfeminine individuals. Little research exists describing vaginal health after the initial recovery from surgery, and evidence-based guidelines for vaginal care practices are unavailable.Aim The study sought to describe self-reported gynecological concerns and vaginal care practices among transfeminine persons who have undergone vaginoplasty.Methods A total of 60 transfeminine participants 18+ years of age, living in Canada, and who had undergone vaginoplasty at least 1 year prior were recruited through social media, community groups, healthcare provider referrals, and study recontact. Participants completed a cross-sectional, online questionnaire detailing demographics, gynecological concerns, and genital practices and exposures. Hierarchical clustering was used to group participants based on behavioral practices and exposures. Associations between clusters and gynecological concerns were assessed.Outcomes Outcomes included self-reported gynecological concerns within the past year, recent vulvar or vaginal symptoms (past 30 days), and behavioral practices/exposures, including douching with varied products and dilating.Results Participants reported a variety of concerns in the past year, including urinary tract infection (13%) and internal hair regrowth (23%). More than half (57%) had experienced at least 1 recent vaginal symptom, most commonly malodor (27%) and vaginal bleeding (21%). Of participants, 48% were dilating weekly and 52% reported douching in the past 30 days. Four distinct clusters of vaginal practices/exposures were identified: limited exposures; dilating, no douching; dilating and douching; and diverse exposures. No significant associations between cluster membership and gynecological concerns were identified, though cluster membership was significantly associated with surgical center (P = .03). Open-text write-ins provided descriptions of symptoms and symptom management strategies.Clinical Implications The results provide insight for clinicians on common patient-reported gynecological concerns and current vaginal care practices and exposures, including symptom management strategies.Strengths and Limitations This was the first study to investigate vaginal health and genital practices/exposures among a community sample of transfeminine individuals. As participants self-enrolled for a detailed survey and swab collection, individuals experiencing concerns were likely overrepresented.Conclusion Transfeminine individuals reported a range of gynecological concerns outside of the surgical healing period. Genital practices/exposures varied across clusters, but no clear associations between clusters and symptoms were identified; instead, practice/exposure clusters were dependent on where the individual underwent vaginoplasty. There is a need for evidence to inform diagnostics, treatments, and vaginal care guidelines to support vaginal health.

TI  - A crowdsourced intervention to promote hepatitis B and C testing among men who have sex with men in China: study protocol for a nationwide online randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends all men who have sex with men (MSM) receive Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) testing. MSM in China are a high-risk group for HBV and HCV infection, but test uptake is low. Crowdsourcing invites a large group to solve a problem and then shares the solution with the public. This nationwide online randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention to increase HBV and HCV testing among MSM in China.
   Methods: Seven hundred MSM will be recruited through social media operated by MSM organizations in China. Eligible participants will be born biologically male, age 16 years or older, report previous anal sex with another man, and reside in China. After completing a baseline online survey, participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will include two components: (1) a multimedia component will deliver two videos and two images promoting HBV and HCV testing developed through a crowdsourcing contest in China; (2) a participatory component will invite men to submit suggestions for how to improve crowdsourced videos and images. The control arm will not view any images or videos and will not be invited to submit suggestions. All participants will be offered reimbursement for HBV and HCV testing costs. The primary outcome is HBV and HCV test uptake confirmed through electronic submission of test report photos within four weeks of enrolment. Secondary outcomes include self-reported HBV and HCV test uptake, HBV vaccination uptake, and change in stigma toward people living with HBV after four weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated using intention to treat and as-exposed analyses and compared using two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
   Discussion: Few previous studies have evaluated interventions to increase HBV and HCV testing in middle-income countries with a high burden of hepatitis. Delivering a crowdsourced intervention using social media is a novel approach to increasing hepatitis testing rates. HBV and HCV test uptake will be confirmed through test report photos, avoiding the limitations of self-reported testing outcomes.

TI  - Defining ethical standards for the application of digital tools to population health research
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - There is growing interest in population health research, which uses methods based on artificial intelligence. Such research draws on a range of clinical and non-clinical data to make predictions about health risks, such as identifying epidemics and monitoring disease spread. Much of this research uses data from social media in the public domain or anonymous secondary health data and is therefore exempt from ethics committee scrutiny. While the ethical use and regulation of digital-based research has been discussed, little attention has been given to the ethics governance of such research in higher education institutions in the field of population health. Such governance is essential to how scholars make ethical decisions and provides assurance to the public that researchers are acting ethically. We propose a process of ethics governance for population health research in higher education institutions. The approach takes the form of review after the research has been completed, with particular focus on the role artificial intelligence algorithms play in augmenting decision-making. The first layer of review could be national, open-science repositories for open-source algorithms and affiliated data or information which are developed during research. The second layer would be a sector-specific validation of the research processes and algorithms by a committee of academics and stakeholders with a wide range of expertise across disciplines. The committee could be created as an off-shoot of an already functioning national oversight body or health technology assessment organization. We use case studies of good practice to explore how this process might operate.

TI  - From Information Seekers to Innovators: Qualitative Analysis Describing Experiences of the Second Generation of E-Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Current health care systems are rarely designed to meet the needs of people living with chronic conditions. However, some patients and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the internet for finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own health data and appears to be more innovative.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the second generation of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their self-care and health care.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the self-determination theory-autonomy, relatedness, and competence-at the outset.
   Results: Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on social media. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their autonomy was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them.
   Conclusions: Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the health care system is not prepared to support them under these new circumstances.

T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRUST, SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRUSTCOM
CP  - 21st IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IEEE TrustCom)
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly connecting the most intimate parts of our daily lives to the Internet via connected ecosystems of hardware and software products. However, how these ecosystems operate and, in particular their impact on user privacy remains an open question. In this paper, we explore this question by analysing IFTTT, a popular task automation platform based on trigger-action programming. Through IFTTT, end users can easily create applets, aka recipes, that glue different IoT devices and online services together. While IFTTT brings many online services together, such as social media and mobile applications, its use for IoT automation is appealing for many users. Hence, analyzing the IFTTT ecosystem over time, enables us to study IoT trends and adaptation rate in realuser settings. In this paper we describe the IFTTT evolution by analyzing two existing IFTTT data sets and compiling a recent data set of its services and applets. This analysis exposes new platform characteristics and trends. Our data set, which was collected in October 2021, contains data about 694 services, 50 898 applets, and 7 003 endpoints. It also contains data about the information exchange in the platform via ingredients. In addition, we identify applets that might impose privacy risks for their users by detecting sensitive information flows in the system. We find that almost 30% of installations in the platform involve applets that utilize privacy-sensitive information such as users' personal information, location, and health data. This trend is consistently present in the three analyzed data sets and, disturbingly, increases over time.

TI  - Public willingness to participate in personalized health research and biobanking: A large-scale Swiss survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public's willingness, attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research participation by providing health information and biological material. The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide 'traditional' types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health research efforts.

TI  - Framework for a Community Health Observing System for the Gulf of Mexico Region: Preparing for Future Disasters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) region is prone to disasters, including recurrent oil spills, hurricanes, floods, industrial accidents, harmful algal blooms, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. The GoM and other regions of the U.S. lack sufficient baseline health information to identify, attribute, mitigate, and facilitate prevention of major health effects of disasters. Developing capacity to assess adverse human health consequences of future disasters requires establishment of a comprehensive, sustained community health observing system, similar to the extensive and well-established environmental observing systems. We propose a system that combines six levels of health data domains, beginning with three existing, national surveys and studies plus three new nested, longitudinal cohort studies. The latter are the unique and most important parts of the system and are focused on the coastal regions of the five GoM States. A statistically representative sample of participants is proposed for the new cohort studies, stratified to ensure proportional inclusion of urban and rural populations and with additional recruitment as necessary to enroll participants from particularly vulnerable or under-represented groups. Secondary data sources such as syndromic surveillance systems, electronic health records, national community surveys, environmental exposure databases, social media, and remote sensing will inform and augment the collection of primary data. Primary data sources will include participant-provided information via questionnaires, clinical measures of mental and physical health, acquisition of biological specimens, and wearable health monitoring devices. A suite of biomarkers may be derived from biological specimens for use in health assessments, including calculation of allostatic load, a measure of cumulative stress. The framework also addresses data management and sharing, participant retention, and system governance. The observing system is designed to continue indefinitely to ensure that essential pre-, during-, and post-disaster health data are collected and maintained. It could also provide a model/vehicle for effective health observation related to infectious disease pandemics such as COVID-19. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive, disaster-focused health observing system such as the one proposed here currently in existence or planned elsewhere. Significant strengths of the GoM Community Health Observing System (CHOS) are its longitudinal cohorts and ability to adapt rapidly as needs arise and new technologies develop.

TI  - Innovating at the human-technology interface in disasters and disease outbreaks
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB  - Disasters and disease outbreaks have long been a catalyst for innovative applications of emerging technologies. The urgent need to respond to an emergency leads to resourceful uses of the technologies at hand. However, the best and most cost-effective use of new technologies is to prevent disease and improve resilience. In this paper, the authors present a range of approaches through which both opportunities can be grasped.
   Global connectedness enables more data to be collected and processed in emergencies, especially with the rise of open-source data, including social media. In general, the poorest and most remote populations are most vulnerable to disaster. However, with smaller, faster, smarter, cheaper and more connected technology, reliable, efficient, and targeted response and recovery can be provided. Initially, crowdsourcing was used to find people, map affected areas, and determine resource allocation. This led to the generation of an overwhelming amount of data, and the need to extract valuable information from that data in a timely manner. As technology evolved, organisations started outsourcing many tasks, first to other people, then to machines. Since the volume of data generated outpaces human capacity, data analysis is being automated using artificial intelligence and machine learning, which furthers our abilities in predictive analytics. As we move towards prevention rather than remediation, information collection and processing must become faster and more efficient while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, these new strategies and technologies can help us to move forwards, by integrating layers of human, veterinary, public, and environmental health data for a One Health approach.

TI  - Cardiovascular Safety of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Team USA Athletes
T2  - SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
AB  - Background: Despite reassuring scientific data, the lay press and social media continue to propagate largely unsubstantiated claims that a significant number of athletes have died from cardiovascular complications related to COVID-19 vaccines. The present study sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 vaccine cardiovascular complications in Team USA athletes.Hypothesis: It was predicted that there would be a low incidence of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 vaccination in Team USA athletes.Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.Level of Evidence: Level 4.Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee electronic medical record, inclusive of athletes who represented Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games, for COVID-19 vaccine cardiac complications including sudden cardiac arrest/death, myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis. Vaccination status (ie, fully vaccinated, yes or no), date of vaccination and eligible boosters, and type of vaccination during the study period were abstracted from the electronic medical record.Results: A total of 1229 athletes represented Team USA during the 2020 Tokyo (Olympic, 697; Paralympic, 237) and 2022 Beijing Games (Olympic, 229; Paralympic, 66). For the 2020 Tokyo Games, 73.8% of Olympians and 80.6% of Paralympians with available vaccination status had completed a primary vaccine series. For the 2022 Beijing Games, 100% of Olympians and Paralympians with available vaccination status were fully vaccinated. No athletes suffered sudden cardiac arrest/death or were diagnosed with myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination.Conclusion: The data demonstrate an overall willingness of elite athletes to receive recommended COVID-19 vaccination coupled with a complete absence of vaccine-related cardiac complications in >1 year of follow-up.Clinical Relevance: Supposedly, this is the first study to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 vaccine cardiovascular complications in elite athletes. These data are an important first step to better inform cardiologists and sports medicine physicians who care for elite athletes.

TI  - Global Prevalence and Drivers of Dental Students' COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Background: Acceleration of mass vaccination strategies is the only pathway to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals and students have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of dental students globally towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students' acceptance levels. Methods: A global cross-sectional study was carried out in February 2021 using an online questionnaire. The study was liaised by the scientific committee of the International Association of Dental Students (IADS), and data were collected through the national and local coordinators of IADS member organizations. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and the independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. Results: A total of 6639 students from 22 countries, representing all world regions, responded to the questionnaire properly. Their mean age was 22.1 +/- 2.8 (17-40) years, and the majority were females (70.5%), in clinical years (66.8%), and from upper-middle-income economies (45.7%). In general, 22.5% of dental students worldwide were hesitant, and 13.9% rejected COVID-19 vaccines. The students in low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) economies had significantly higher levels of vaccine hesitancy compared to their peers in upper-middle- and high-income (UMHI) economies (30.4% vs. 19.8%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: The global acceptance level of dental students for COVID-19 vaccines was suboptimal, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy was influenced by the socioeconomic context where the dental students live and study. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were barriers to vaccination. The findings of this study call for further implementation of epidemiology (infectious diseases) education within undergraduate dental curricula.

TI  - Study to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for identifying undiagnosed COPD among residents (≥40 years) in four cities in China: protocol for a multicentre cross-sectional study on behalf of the Breathe Well group
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction The latest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) epidemiology survey in China estimated that there were 99 million potential COPD patients in the country, the majority of whom are undiagnosed. Screening for COPD in primary care settings is of vital importance for China, but it is not known which strategy would be the most suitable for adoption in primary care. Studies have been conducted to test the accuracy of questionnaires, expiratory peak flow meters and microspirometers to screen for COPD, but no study has directly evaluated and compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these methods in the Chinese setting.
   Methods and analysis We present the protocol for a multicentre cross-sectional study, to be conducted in eight community hospitals from four cities among Chinese adults aged 40 years or older to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different case-finding methods for COPD, and determine the test performance of individual and combinations of screening tests and strategies in comparison with quality diagnostic spirometry. Index tests are screening questionnaires (COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), COPD Assessment in Primary Care To Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk Questionnaire (CAPTURE), symptom-based questionnaire, COPD Screening Questionnaire (COPD-SQ)), microspirometer and peak flow. Each participant will complete all of these tests in one assessment. The primary analysis will compare the performance of a screening questionnaire with a handheld device. Secondary analyses will include the comparative performance of each index test, as well as a comparison of strategies where we use a screening questionnaire and a handheld device. Approximately 2000 participants will be recruited over 9 to 12 months.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by Peking University Hospital and University of Birmingham. All study participants will provide written informed consent. Study results will be published in appropriate journal and presented at national and international conferences, as well as relevant social media and various community/stakeholder engagement activities.

TI  - Potassium canrenoate in brain-dead organ donors: a randomised controlled clinical trial protocol (CANREO-PMO)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Ischaemia/reperfusion injuries (IRIs) are associated with poorer survival of kidney grafts from expanded criteria donors. Preclinical studies have shown that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) prevent acute and chronic post-ischaemic renal dysfunction by limiting IRI. However, data concerning the safety of MRAs in brain-dead donor patients are scarce. We seek to investigate the tolerance of MRAs on the haemodynamics in this population.Methods and analysis CANREO-PMO is a randomised, controlled, single-centre, double-blind study. Brain-dead organ donors hospitalised in intensive care are randomised 1:1 after consent to receive 200 mg potassium canrenoate or its matching placebo every 6 hours until organ procurement. The primary outcome is a hierarchical composite endpoint that includes: (1) cardiocirculatory arrest, (2) the impossibility of kidney procurement, (3) the average hourly dose of norepinephrine/epinephrine between randomisation and departure to the operating room, and (4) the average hourly volume of crystalloids and/or colloids received. Thirty-six patients will be included. The secondary endpoints evaluated among the graft recipients are the: (1) vital status of the kidney graft recipients and serum creatinine level with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) at 3 months after renal transplantation, (2) percentage of patients dependent on dialysis and/or with an estimated GFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at 3 months, (3) vital status of the kidney graft recipients at 3 months, and (4) vital status of the kidney graft recipients and creatinine levels (in mu mol/L), with the estimated GFR according to CKD-EPI (in mL/min/1.73 m(2)), at 1 year, 3 years and 10 years after transplantation.Ethics and dissemination This trial has full ethical approval (Comite de Protection des Personnes: CPP Ouest II-ANGERS, France), and the written consent of relatives will be obtained. Results will be reported at conferences, peer-reviewed publications and using social media channels.

TI  - CURRENT PERSPECTIVE ON DETERMINANTS AND DETERRENTS OF COVID-19
T2  - ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
AB  - Introduction: COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has left several countries grappling with a devastating pandemic. Developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine may be possible but there are significant issues with public distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Public health efforts aimed at testing symptomatic patients, and other preventative measures, however, these efforts have been unable to significantly curtail the pandemic. There is a paucity of research that comprehensively focuses on determinants and deterrents to identify critical knowledge gaps. This review aims to focus efforts on strategies to contain the virus.
   Materials and methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, and archives of preprints were searched with the following terms "COVID-19 ", "SARS-CoV-2", "2019-nCoV", "epidemiology", "determinants", and "deterrents." The reference lists of articles were examined for relevant studies.
   Results: All age groups are susceptible and can transmit the virus. Individuals with severe outcomes include but are not limited to age 65 years or older, male sex, ethnic minorities, and the presence of comorbidities. Misinformation on social media and other traditional information sources is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Indoor and outdoor aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic' transmission, and incubation period of over 14 days in some infected individuals have been reported. Widespread rapid SARS-CoV-2 population screening and contact tracing are methods of effective containment including proper use of facemasks in crowded outdoor or indoor spaces, installation of HEPA filters, regular hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. Simple cost-effective measures include opening doors and windows of buildings where possible.
   Conclusion: Achieving herd immunity with a vaccine may be difficult because of misinformation. A potential incubation period of over 14 days is the bane of Covid-19 current control strategies. More research is needed including investigating the long-term effects of Covid-19 particularly in children, and fecal aerosol transmission. Evidence-based information and the identified infection prevention measures should be advocated.

TI  - A 4-Year Analysis of the Incidence of Injuries Among CrossFit-Trained Participants
T2  - ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Background: High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a new training modality that merges high-intensity exercise with functional (multijoint) movements. Even though others exist, CrossFit training has emerged as the most common form of HIFT. Recently, several reports have linked CrossFit training to severe injuries and/or life-threatening conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis. Empirical evidence regarding the safety of this training modality is currently limited.
   Purpose: To examine the incidence of injuries related to CrossFit participation and to estimate the rate of injuries in a large cross-sectional convenience sample of CrossFit participants from around the world.
   Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
   Methods: A total of 3049 participants who reported engaging in CrossFit training between 2013 and 2017 were surveyed.
   Results: A portion (30.5%) of the participants surveyed reported experiencing an injury over the previous 12 months because of their participation in CrossFit training. Injuries to the shoulders (39%), back (36%), knees (15%), elbows (12%), and wrists (11%) were most common for both male and female participants. The greatest number of injuries occurred among those who participated in CrossFit training 3 to 5 days per week (chi(2) = 12.51; P = .0019). Overall, and based on the assumed maximum number of workout hours per week, the injury rate was 0.27 per 1000 hours (females: 0.28; males: 0.26), whereas the assumed minimum number of workout hours per week resulted in an injury rate of 0.74 per 1000 hours (females: 0.78; males: 0.70).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CrossFit training is relatively safe compared with more traditional training modalities. However, it seems that those within their first year of training as well as those who engage in this training modality less than 3 days per week and/or participate in less than 3 workouts per week are at a greater risk for injuries.

TI  - Myocardial infarction and stroke subsequent to urinary tract infection (MISSOURI): protocol for a self-controlled case series using linked electronic health records
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction There is increasing interest in the relationship between acute infections and acute cardiovascular events. Most previous research has focused on understanding whether the risk of acute cardiovascular events increases following a respiratory tract infection. The relationship between urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute cardiovascular events is less well studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between UTI and acute myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.
   Methods and analysis We will undertake a self-controlled case series study using linked anonymised general practice, hospital admission and microbiology data held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Self-controlled case series is a relatively novel study design where individuals act as their own controls, thereby inherently controlling for time-invariant confounders. Only individuals who experience an exposure and outcome of interest are included.
   We will identify individuals in the SAIL Databank who have a hospital admission record for acute MI or stroke during the study period of 2010-2020. Individuals will need to be aged 30-100 during the study period and be Welsh residents for inclusion. UTI will be identified using general practice, microbiology and hospital admissions data. We will calculate the incidence of MI and stroke in predefined risk periods following an UTI and in 'baseline' periods (without UTI exposure) and use conditional Poisson regression models to derive incidence rate ratios.
   Ethics and dissemination Data access, research permissions and approvals have been obtained from the SAIL independent Information Governance Review Panel, project number 0972. Findings will be disseminated through conferences, blogs, social media threads and peer-reviewed journals. Results will be of interest internationally to primary and secondary care clinicians who manage UTIs and may inform future clinical trials of preventative therapy.

TI  - A dynamic data structure for temporal reachability with unsorted contact insertions
T2  - SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING
AB  - Temporal graphs represent interactions between entities over the time. These interactions may be direct (a contact between two nodes at some time instant), or indirect, through sequences of contacts called temporal paths (journeys). Deciding whether an entity can reach another through a journey is useful for various applications in communication networks and epidemiology, among other fields. In this paper, we present a data structure that maintains temporal reachability information under the addition of new contacts. In contrast to previous works, the contacts can be inserted in an arbitrary order-in particular, non-chronologically-which corresponds to systems where the information is collected a posteriori (e.g., when trying to reconstruct contamination chains among people). The main component of our data structure is a generalization of transitive closure called timed transitive closure (TTC), which allows us to maintain reachability information relative to all nested time intervals, without storing all these intervals, nor the journeys themselves. Let n be the number of nodes and tau be the number of timestamps in the lifetime of the temporal graph. Our data structure answers reachability queries regarding the existence of a journey from a given node to another within a given time interval in time O(log tau); it has a worst-case insertion time of O(n(2) log tau); and it can reconstruct a valid journey that witnesses reachability in time O(k log tau), where k < n is the maximum number of contacts of this journey. Finally, the space complexity of our reachability data structure is O(n(2)tau), which remains within the worst-case size of the temporal graph itself.

TI  - Short-term improvement of mental health after a COVID-19 vaccination
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Introduction The role of COVID-19 vaccination on the mental health of the general population remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the short-term change in depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults.
   Methods A prospective study of 7,925 individuals recruited from ongoing cohort studies at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, or through social media campaigns, with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (defined as a self-reported total score of >= 10 in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively) was calculated one month before, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or choosing not to report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability.
   Results 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was lower after both first (aRR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression; aRR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85 for depression; aRR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared to before vaccination. Similar results were observed among individuals receiving only one dose (aRR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.68-0.84 for depression; aRR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.72-0.94 for anxiety), comparing after first dose to before vaccination.
   Conclusions We observed a short-term improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults receiving COVID-19 vaccines in the current pandemic. Our findings provide new evidence to support outreach campaigns targeting hesitant groups.

TI  - The Sentiment Analysis of Tweets as a New Tool to Measure Public Perception of Male Erectile and Ejaculatory Dysfunctions
T2  - SEXUAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Twitter is a social network based on "tweets," short messages of up to 280 characters. Social media has been investigated in health care research to ascertain positive or negative feelings associated with several conditions but never in sexual medicine.
   Aim: To assess perceptions related to erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) among Twitter users.
   Methods: Data collection was performed on a daily basis between May 24-October 9, 2018 (138 days) via an automated script. Data collection was then performed after data cleaning. The statistical software R and the rtweet packages were used in both phases.
   Results: We collected 11,000 unique tweets for PE and 30,546 unique tweets for ED. After data cleaning, we analyzed 7,020 tweets on PE and 22,648 tweets on ED by analyzing the most recurring words and the clusters describing word associations. The most popular words for ED were "Treatment," "Health," and "Viagra," whereas "Sex," "Sexual," and "Cure" were the top 3 for PE. Word clusters suggest the presence of some recurring themes, such as medical terms being grouped together. Additionally, tweets reflect the general feelings triggered by specific events, such as pieces of news pertaining to sexual dysfunctions.
   Clinical Implications: Tweets on sexual dysfunctions are posted every day, with more tweets on ED than on PE. Treatment is among the chief topics discussed for both conditions, although health concerns differ between PE and DE tweets.
   Strength and Limitations: This is the first analysis conducted on Tweets in the field of andrology and sexual medicine. A significant number of tweets were collected and analyzed. However, quantitative assessment of the sentiment was not feasible.
   Conclusion: Sexual dysfunctions are openly discussed on social media, and Twitter analysis could help understand the needs and interests of the general population on these themes.

TI  - Linking parasitism to network centrality and the impact of sampling bias in its interpretation
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Group living is beneficial for individuals, but also comes with costs. One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.

TI  - Getting Indonesia's HIV epidemic to zero? One size does not fit all
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
AB  - Indonesia has one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in the world. AIDS related deaths in Indonesia have not fallen and have increased significantly since 2010. HIV infection rates remain high and rising in key affected populations. We provide an on the ground, evidence-based perspective of the challenges Indonesia faces. We discuss what is required to adopt tailored public health approaches that address context specific challenges, confront structural barriers and the heterogeneity of the current evolving HIV epidemic.

TI  - Hui: a partnership in practice in familial hypercholesterolemia
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - AIMS: To empower a large whanau (extended family) with a history of severe premature heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
   METHODS: After broad consultation a Hui was held to discuss how to better manage this issue to ensure present and future generations were appropriately screened and treated.
   RESULTS: A closed social media page with detailed information on how to manage and screen FH that includes a family tree (for those who consent) has been created. The whanau, facilitated by health professionals, have ownership of their health. This has led to an uptake of screening and treatment for FH with whanau who are now able to inform local health professionals about their disorder.
   CONCLUSION: FH is the most common dominant genetic disorder in humans and causes premature heart disease and death. Current approaches are dependent on index patients presenting for cascade screening and do not incorporate the needs and views of the extended whanau. Establishing a partnership with the whanau and giving back control of health information is crucial to ensure equity. A national systematic programme is also needed to manage this condition with important health outcomes that can be averted if treated from a young age.

TI  - Visual topic models for healthcare data clustering
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Social media is a great source to search health-related topics for envisages solutions towards healthcare. Topic models originated from Natural Language Processing that is receiving much attention in healthcare areas because of interpretability and its decision making, which motivated us to develop visual topic models. Topic models are used for the extraction of health topics for analyzing discriminative and coherent latent features of tweet documents in healthcare applications. Discovering the number of topics in topic models is an important issue. Sometimes, users enable an incorrect number of topics in traditional topic models, which leads to poor results in health data clustering. In such cases, proper visualizations are essential to extract information for identifying cluster trends. To aid in the visualization of topic clouds and health tendencies in the document collection, we present hybrid topic modeling techniques by integrating traditional topic models with visualization procedures. We believe proposed visual topic models viz., Visual Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (VNMF), Visual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VLDA), Visual intJNon-negative Matrix Factorization (VintJNMF), and Visual Probabilistic Latent Schematic Indexing (VPLSI) are promising methods for extracting tendency of health topics from various sources in healthcare data clustering. Standard and benchmark social health datasets are used in an experimental study to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed models concerning clustering accuracy (CA), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), precision (P), recall (R), F-Score (F) measures and computational complexities. VNMF visual model performs significantly at an increased rate of 32.4% under cosine based metric in the display of visual clusters and an increased rate of 35-40% in performance measures compared to other visual methods on different number of health topics.

TI  - A privacy-preserving cryptosystem for IoT E-healthcare
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - Privacy preservation has become a prerequisite for modern applications in the cloud, social media, Internet of things (IoT), and E- healthcare systems. In general, health and medical data contain images and medical information about the patients and such personal data should be kept confidential in order to maintain the patients' privacy. Due to limitations in digital data properties, traditional encryption schemes over textual and structural one-dimension data cannot be applied directly to e-health data. In addition, when personal data are sent over the open channels, patients may lose privacy of data contents. Hence, a secure lightweight keyframe extraction method is highly required to ensure timely, correct, and privacy-preserving e-health services. Besides this, it is inherently difficult to achieve a satisfied level of security in a cost-effective way while considering the constraints of real-time e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving chaos-based encryption cryptosystem for patients' privacy protection. The proposed cryptosystem can protect patient's images from a compromised broker. In particular, we propose a fast probabilistic cryptosystem to secure medical keyframes that are extracted from wireless capsule endoscopy procedure using a prioritization method. The encrypted images produced by our cryptosystem exhibits randomness behavior, which guarantee computational efficiency as well as a highest level of security for the keyframes against various attacks. Furthermore, it processes the medical data without leaking any information, thus preserving patient's privacy by allowing only authorized users for decryption. The experimental results and security analysis from different perspectives verify the excellent performance of our encryption cryptosystem compared to other recent encryption schemes.

TI  - Stigma, guilt and motherhood: Experiences of pregnant women with COVID-19 in Brazil
T2  - WOMEN AND BIRTH
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic raises health issues worldwide. Infected pregnant women may have negative mental health outcomes, but little is known about their emotional experiences.
   Aim: We aimed to understand the experience of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, regarding their feelings, their relationships, and the influence of social media.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among 22 women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, from a tertiary hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in Brazil (May-August 2020). We applied semi-directed interviews, sociodemographic and health data sheets, and field diaries. We built the sample purposefully. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis and discussed data considering the health psychology framework.
   Results: We created five categories following a timeline perspective, from before infection to the experience after recovering. Pregnant women were resistant to believing the diagnosis. They described a fear of serious symptoms or death, concerns about the fetus, sorrow from being isolated, and worries about stigma. Family relationships were ambiguous, generating either support or tension. The attachment to the health team through telemedicine or support during hospitalization produced a feeling of security.
   Conclusions: Participants psychologically denied the COVID-19 diagnosis and did not accomplish isolation properly, even upon medical recommendations. The illness may produce a traumatic experience, regardless of mild or severe symptoms, but family/friend support and contact with the health team helped them to cope. We offer important insights for the clinical approach and future research, emphasizing that infected pregnant women require emotional support. (c) 2021 Australian College of Midwives.

TI  - A digital health research platform for community engagement, recruitment, and retention of sexual and gender minority adults in a national longitudinal cohort study-The PRIDE Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Objective: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are underrepresented in research. We sought to create a digital research platform to engage, recruit, and retain SGM people in a national, longitudinal, dynamic, cohort study (The PRIDE Study) of SGM health.
   Materials and Methods: We partnered with design and development firms and engaged SGM community members to build a secure, cloud-based, containerized, microservices-based, feature-rich, research platform. We created PRIDEnet, a national network of individuals and organizations that actively engaged SGM communities in all stages of health research. The PRIDE Study participants were recruited via in-person outreach, communications to PRIDEnet constituents, social media advertising, and word-of-mouth. Participants completed surveys to report demographic as well as physical, mental, and social health data.
   Results: We built a secure digital research platform with engaging functionality that engaged SGM people and recruited and retained 13 731 diverse individuals in 2 years. A sizeable sample of 3813 gender minority people (32.8% of cohort) were recruited despite representing only approximately 0.6% of the population. Participants engaged with the platform and completed comprehensive annual surveys-including questions about sensitive and stigmatizing topics-to create a data resource and join a cohort for ongoing SGM health research.
   Discussion: With an appealing digital platform, recruitment and engagement in online-only longitudinal cohort studies are possible. Participant engagement with meaningful, bidirectional relationships creates stakeholders and enables study cocreation. Research about effective tactics to engage, recruit, and maintain active participation from all communities is needed.
   Conclusion: This digital research platform successfully recruited and engaged diverse SGM participants in The PRIDE Study. A similar approach may be successful in partnership with other underrepresented and vulnerable populations.

TI  - Improving Prehospital Protocol Adherence Using Bundled Educational Interventions
T2  - PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Background: Seizures and anaphylaxis are life-threatening conditions that require immediate treatment in the prehospital setting. There is variation in treatment of pediatric prehospital patients for both anaphylaxis and seizures. This educational study was done to improve compliance with pediatric prehospital protocols, educate prehospital providers and decrease variation in care. Objective: To improve the quality of care for children with seizures and anaphylaxis in the prehospital setting using a bundled, multifaceted educational intervention. Methods: Evidence-based pediatric prehospital guidelines for seizures and anaphylaxis were used to create a curriculum for the paramedics in the EMS system. The curriculum included in-person training, videos, distribution of decision support tools, and a targeted social media campaign to reinforce the evidence-based guidelines. Prehospital charts were reviewed for pediatric patients with a chief complaint of anaphylaxis or seizures who were transported by paramedics to one of ten hospitals, including three children's hospitals, for 8 months prior to the intervention and eight months following the intervention. The primary outcome for seizures was whether midazolam was given via the preferred intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes. The primary outcome for anaphylaxis was whether IM epinephrine was given. Results: A total of 1,402 pediatric patients were transported for seizures by paramedics to during the study period. A total of 88 patients were actively seizing pre-intervention and 93 post-intervention. Of the actively seizing patients, 52 were given midazolam pre-intervention and 62 were given midazolam post-intervention. Pre-intervention, 29% (15/52) of the seizing patients received midazolam via the preferred IM or IN routes, compared to 74% (46/62) of the seizing patients post-intervention. A total of 45 patients with anaphylaxis were transported by paramedics, 30 pre-intervention and 15 post-intervention. Paramedics administered epinephrine to 17% (5/30) patients pre-intervention and 67% (10/15) patients post-intervention. Conclusion: The use of a bundled, multifaceted educational intervention including in-person training, decision support tools, and social media improved adherence to updated evidence-based pediatric prehospital protocols.

TI  - Regional and seasonal variations in functional abdominal pain and functional constipation prevalence among Saudi children
T2  - SAGE OPEN MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives:This study aimed to evaluate functional abdominal pain disorders and functional constipation prevalence in the central region of Saudi Arabia, and compare it to that of the western region. Methods:This was a cross-sectional study using online questionnaires targeting the general population of Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia. Subjects were randomly selected by sharing links on social media groups. Any parent with a 3-18-year-old child was included, and children with chronic medical illnesses or symptoms of organic GI disorders were excluded. Results:Three hundred nineteen subjects were included in the final analysis; the prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders overall was 6.2% and the prevalence of functional constipation was 8.1%. Conclusions:Functional constipation diagnosis seems to be affected by life stressors or a previous viral illness. Seasonal variations had minimal effect on functional abdominal pain disorder and functional constipation symptom frequency and severity.

TI  - Correlation of publication frequency of newspaper articles with environment and public health issues in fire-prone peatland regions of Riau in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Forest fires in peatlands emit pollutants to the atmosphere, affecting public health. Though air quality data and epidemiology information are helpful in the management of the environment and public health, they are not always available. We aimed to reveal the utility of newspaper articles for estimating the public health concerns posed by air pollution. Using the database of a local newspaper, Riau Pos, in Riau Province of Sumatra, Indonesia, we have studied spatiotemporal correlations between publication frequency of newspaper articles mentioning search terms relevant to health issues and Fire Radiation Power (FRP) of peatland fires. FRP from one of the NASA satellite databases has been used as an index of air pollution caused by peatland fires. Visibility data for airport operation were also used as an index of particulate matter concentrations. The study regions are primarily the fire-prone Riau Province and nearby areas in the central area of Sumatra, Indonesia, from 2009 to 2018. Newspaper articles related to public health are found to be associated with FRP and visibility, or regional air pollution.

TI  - Psychosocial and health behavioural impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on adults in the USA: protocol for a longitudinal cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Although social distancing may help contain the spread of COVID-19, the social isolation and loneliness it causes can heighten stress, contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and have deleterious effects on social relationships. This ongoing longitudinal cohort study aims to (1) characterise the psychological, social and health behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in the USA; (2) determine whether these impacts differ for certain subgroups based on sociodemographics and other individual-level factors; and (3) explore whether there are modifiable factors (eg, coping, social support) that moderate the effects of the pandemic over time. Methods and analysis Adults (aged >= 18 years) who were fluent in either English or Spanish were recruited via social media and invited to complete an online survey during the 8-week period from 13 April to 8 June 2020 (baseline). Follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12 months after baseline. Data transformations, non-parametric tests or other alternative methods will be used when appropriate. Descriptive statistics and cross-sectional analyses will be performed. Longitudinal associations will be analysed using multilevel modelling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the study period. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval was received from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (H-47505). Overall, this study will provide timely information that can be used to inform public health messaging strategies and guide development of assessment tools and interventions to support vulnerable individuals dealing with the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Injury Pathology in Young Gymnasts: A Retrospective Analysis
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Gymnastics has a history of high injury incidence rates. However, little is known about the injury pathology in young gymnasts. The purpose of this study was to fill gaps in the literature by providing insight into the injury pathology in gymnasts aged 6 to 17 years. This study was retrospective in design, where injury data were collected using a Qualtrics questionnaire and distributed via social media. The findings revealed that the most common injury site was the lower limb (60.5%), in particular, the ankle/foot (49%) and knee (27%). Overuse injuries and sprains were most prevalent among the lower limb (25% and 18.4%, respectively), and gymnasts seemed to have a tendency to train through injury with modifications to training. In conclusion, lower limb joint sprain and overuse injuries accounted for the majority of injuries in youth gymnasts. These injuries were more frequently reported in girls in the years associated with peak height velocity and beyond.

TI  - Does the Saudi Population Have Sufficient Awareness of Vitiligo in Southwest Saudi Arabia? A Cross-Sectional Survey, 2022
T2  - CLINICS AND PRACTICE
AB  - Background: Vitiligo is a common acquired hypopigmentation skin condition defined by an idiopathic, gradual, and restricted loss of melanin pigment from otherwise healthy-looking skin. The present study aims to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of and attitudes toward vitiligo among the general population of Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional survey targeting adults of the Jazan region was conducted in 2022. The data were collected using an electronic questionnaire distributed through social media in the region. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS computer program. Knowledge and attitude scores were computed. Results: Most of the respondents (83.7%) had an adequate knowledge level of vitiligo, and almost half of the respondents (46.8%) had a positive attitude toward the disease. The majority of the respondents (84.5%) knew that vitiligo is not contagious. However, the majority of the participants (78.6%) did not know that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease. Most of the respondents (93.1%) do not avoid shaking hands with a vitiligo patient to prevent infection, accept food prepared by a vitiligo patient (69.4%), accept sharing a plate with a vitiligo patient (73.6%), and accept to be helped by a vitiligo patient (86.7%). However, about half of the participants (50.4%) refused to marry a person diagnosed with vitiligo. The knowledge of vitiligo in the study population was not correlated with any of the demographic characters, such as age, gender, education, or occupation (p > 0.05). The most important factors associated with good attitudes were male gender (COR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.92-2.84; p = 0.001) and being aged over 50 years (COR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.53-6.13; p = 0.002). Conclusions: The population in Jazan had a good level of knowledge of vitiligo and a positive attitude toward patients with vitiligo. Social media is the source of information for vitiligo for the majority of the study population. The good attitude toward patients with vitiligo was more prevalent in males and older people. More efforts are needed to improve the knowledge of and attitudes toward vitiligo.

TI  - Recruitment through media and general practitioners resulted in comparable samples in an RCT on incontinence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study was to assess the impact of recruitment strategy on the baseline characteristics of patients recruited in a randomized controlled trial for treating women with urinary incontinence.
   Study Design and Setting: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an earlier trial. Women were recruited through the media (including social media) or from participating general practices. Baseline characteristics were compared by univariate testing. Logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association between recruitment type and multiple baseline characteristics.
   Results: The only differences between recruitment methods were in patient age, with those recruited through the media being significantly older than those recruited through general practice. The mean age difference was 5.0 years (95% confidence interval: 2.2-7.9).
   Conclusion: Samples recruited through the media and through case identification were largely comparable. Therefore, recruitment through the media may be a viable alternative to recruitment through primary care. This may be especially relevant for research on eHealth treatment for conditions with which patients experience barriers when seeking health care. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Invited Commentary: The Uneven Gender Revolution and the Gender Gap in Depression in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Women suffer depression at higher rates than men. In a meta-analysis using data from 1982-2017, Platt et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2021;190(7):1190-1206) examine trends by age group in the gender depression gap and find no change in the depression gap among adults despite large changes in women's opportunities during the same time period. They do, however, find an increase over time in the gender gap in depression among adolescents. I concur with Platt et al. that likely explanations for their findings involve the social environment. For adult women, the burden of being responsible for the majority of the household labor and the rise in unmarried parenting are likely explanations for why increased paid work opportunities have not resulted in a decrease in the gender gap in depression. For adolescents, the increase might be due to the popularity of social media rising at the same time expectations surrounding beauty and attractiveness heightened for girls and young women. Platt et al. highlight the relationship between the uneven change of the "gender revolution" and depression.

TI  - Digital Technology Use and Mental Health Consultations: Survey of the Views and Experiences of Clinicians and Young People
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in the lives of young people and have important effects on their mental health.Objective: We aimed to explore 3 key areas of the intersection between digital technology and mental health: the views and experiences of young people and clinicians about digital technology and mental health; implementation and barriers to the UK national guidance recommendation-that the discussion of digital technology use should form a core part of mental health assessment; and how digital technology might be used to support existing consultations.Methods: Two cross-sectional web-based surveys were conducted in 2020 between June and December, with mental health clinicians (n=99) and young people (n=320). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the proportions. Multilinear regression was used to explore how the answers varied by gender, sexuality, and age. Thematic analysis was used to explore the contents of the extended free-text answers. Anxiety was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7).Results: Digital technology use was ubiquitous among young people, with positive and negative aspects acknowledged by both clinicians and young people. Negative experiences were common (131/284, 46.1%) and were associated with increased anxiety levels among young people (GAD-7 3.29; 95% CI 1.97-4.61; P<.001). Although the discussion of digital technology use was regarded as important by clinicians and acceptable by young people, less than half of clinicians (42/85, 49.4%) routinely asked about the use of digital technology and over a third of young people (48/121, 39.6%) who had received mental health care had never been asked about their digital technology use. The conversations were often experienced as unhelpful. Helpful conversations were characterized by greater depth and exploration of how an individual's digital technology use related to mental health. Despite most clinicians (59/83, 71.1%) wanting training, very few (21/86, 24.4%) reported receiving training. Clinicians were open to viewing mental health data from apps or social media to help with consultations. Although young people were generally, in theory, comfortable sharing such data with health professionals, when presented with a binary choice, most reported not wanting to share social media (84/117, 71.8%) or app data (67/118, 56.8%) during consultations.Conclusions: Digital technology use was common, and negative experiences were frequent and associated with anxiety. Over a third of young people were not asked about their digital technology use during mental health consultations, and potentially valuable information about relevant negative experiences on the web was not being captured during consultations. Clinicians would benefit from having access to training to support these discussions with young people. Although young people recognized that app data could be helpful to clinicians, they appeared hesitant to share their own data. This finding suggests that data sharing has barriers that need to be further explored.

T2  - MHEALTH
AB  - Background: Large data sets, also known as ???big data???, shared in health information exchanges (HIEs), can be used in novel ways to advance health, including among communities at risk for HIV infection. We examined values and opinions about the acceptability of using electronic healthcare predictive analytics (eHPA) to promote HIV prevention in men who have sex with men (MSM). Our aims were twofold: (I) to evaluate the perspectives of MSM with diverse race/ethnicity and age on the acceptability of predictive analytics to determine individual HIV risk and (II) to determine acceptability of having targeted prevention messaging based upon those risk estimates sent directly to the consumer. Method: Two of the authors facilitated 12 focus groups (n=57) with adult MSM without HIV, living in NYC. Groups were divided by ethnicity (Black, Latino, and White) and age (under 35 and 35 and over). Participants were recruited through HIV prevention sites, community-based organizations, social media, and Internet sites that serve these communities. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze the data with Dedoose. Results: We identified six main themes related to acceptability: (I) reach, relevance, and potential uptake of using predictive analytics to establish HIV risk and deliver targeted prevention messaging; (II) patient-provider communication; (III) public health and individual rights; (IV) perceptions of intervention effectiveness; (V) electronic health data security; and (VI) stigma. Within each thematic domain, MSM discussed concerns, benefits, and provided recommendations for implementation. Conclusions: MSM in this study were supportive of the use of ???big data??? and technology to reach marginalized populations and improve public health, yet expressed concerns about the relevance, effectiveness, and security eHPA. Efforts to advance eHPA for HIV prevention should address these concerns, especially among the most-at-risk communities of color. Development of eHPA for HIV prevention should involve targeted messaging that addresses specific concerns regarding eHPA security, accuracy, and relevance.

TI  - Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified Meta-Model and Associated Methodology
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a specific clinical problem with a patient's expected clinical course. ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient's health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches.

TI  - AI-Driven Clinical Decision Support: Enhancing Disease Diagnosis Exploiting Patients Similarity
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) facilitates the identification of diseases together with the most suitable treatments. In this paper, we propose a CDS framework able to integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches can be employed. A neural network model for predicting patients' future health conditions is proposed. The approach employs word embedding to model the semantic relations of hospital admissions, symptoms and diagnosis, and it introduces a mechanism to measure the relationships of different diagnosis in terms of symptoms similarity to exploit for the prediction task. Several CDSs, including diagnostic decision support systems for inferring patient diagnosis, have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods typically focus on a single patient and apply manually or automatically constructed decision rules to produce a diagnosis. Even worst, they consider only a single medical condition, whereas it is not uncommon that a patient has more than one medical condition at the same time. The novelty of the proposed approach is the combination of supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence methods allowing to combine several and heterogeneous data sources related to a multitude of patients and concerning different medical conditions. Furthermore, with respect to previous approaches, the diagnosis prediction problem is formulated to predict the exact diagnosis in terms of semantic meaning by exploiting Natural Language Processing concepts. Experimental results, performed on a real-world EHR dataset, show that the proposed approach is effective and accurate and provides clinically meaningful interpretations. The obtained outcomes are promising for future extensions of the framework that could be a valuable means for automatic inferring disease diagnosis.

TI  - Crowdfunding and global health disparities: an exploratory conceptual and empirical analysis
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: The use of crowdfunding platforms to cover the costs of healthcare is growing rapidly within low-, middle-, and high-income countries as a new funding modality in global health. The popularity of such "medical crowdfunding" is fueled by health disparities and gaps in health coverage and social safety-net systems. Crowdfunding in its current manifestations can be seen as an antithesis to universal health coverage. But research on medical crowdfunding, particularly in global health contexts, has been sparse, and accessing robust data is difficult. To map and document how medical crowdfunding is shaped by, and shapes, health disparities, this article offers an exploratory conceptual and empirical analysis of medical crowdfunding platforms and practices around the world. Data are drawn from a mixed-methods analysis of medical crowdfunding campaigns, as well as an ongoing ethnographic study of crowdfunding platforms and the people who use them.
   Results: Drawing on empirical data and case examples, this article describes three main ways that crowdfunding is impacting health equity and health politics around the world: 1) as a technological determinant of health, wherein data ownership, algorithms and platform politics influence health inequities; 2) as a commercial determinant of health, wherein corporate influence reshapes healthcare markets and health data; 3) and as a determinant of health politics, affecting how citizens view health rights and the future of health coverage.
   Conclusions: Rather than viewing crowdfunding as a social media fad or a purely beneficial technology, researchers and publics must recognize it as a complex innovation that is reshaping health systems, influencing health disparities, and shifting political norms, even as it introduces new ways of connecting and caring for those in the midst of health crises. More analysis, and better access to data, is needed to inform policy and address crowdfunding as a source of health disparities.

TI  - The conspiracy of Covid-19 and 5G: Spatial analysis fallacies in the age of data democratization
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - In a context of mistrust in public health institutions and practices, anti-COVID/vaccination protests and the storming of Congress have illustrated that conspiracy theories are real and immanent threat to health and wellbeing, democracy, and public understanding of science. One manifestation of this is the suggested correlation of COVID-19 with 5G mobile technology. Throughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data. For each, we consider the unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying meaningful correlation, and how their discarding facilitates conspiracist attribution. In doing so, we offer a basis both to interrogate conspiracists' uses and interpretation of data from elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential for their future misuse in an age of data democratization. Finally, this paper contributes to work on the basis of conspiracy theories in general, by asserting how - absent an appreciation of these key methodological principles - spatial health data may be especially prone to co-option by conspiracist groups.

TI  - 'Better understanding about what's going on': young Australians' use of digital technologies for health and fitness
T2  - SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY
AB  - Digital technologies such as websites, online discussion forums, social media, content-sharing platforms, mobile apps and wearable devices are now available as a means for young people to learn about and promote their health, physical fitness and wellbeing. This article provides findings from a qualitative interview-based study of young Australians (aged 16-25 years) which explored their practices and understandings related to digital and non-digital sources of health and fitness information, advice and support. The interviews were analysed using a feminist new materialist theoretical framework, paying attention to the affordances, relational connections and affective forces gathering in human-nonhuman assemblages to create a set of key agential capacities. The agential capacities generated by the participants' enactments of digital health included gaining a better knowledge of bodies, illness and healthcare and feeling more in control of health and wellbeing states. While the affordances of convenience, accessibility and detail and diversity of information offered by digital media and devices were valued by the participants, their accounts also highlighted the importance of face-to-face as well as online relationships and personal connections with other people for providing information and support, including family members and friends as well as medical professionals. The participants highly valued the agential capacity of digital technologies to generate detailed information about their bodies and health states and imagined new technologies that would be able to achieve even more detailed personalisation and customisation. However, they expressed little knowledge or concern about how their personal health data may be exploited by other actors or agencies. These insights go some way to recognising and acknowledging the embodied, affective and relational dimensions of living with, through and in the more-than-human worlds of digital health.

TI  - How are groups of early career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists contributing to global health and policy development: A cross-sectional survey
T2  - RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
AB  - Background: Early career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientist groups (ECPGs) can make valuable contri-butions to addressing global health challenges and policy development. There is limited information describing their contribution to this topic. This study describes initiatives and activities related to global health and policy development led by ECPGs.Methods: An online questionnaire was disseminated between July and October 2020 through the International Pharmaceutical Federation Young Pharmacists Group (FIP YPG) mailing list and its social media network. The survey consisted of questions about ECPGs' involvement in global health and policy development activities. In addition to groups or organisations, the FIP YPG also invited individual pharmacists and pharmaceutical sci-entists to explore their needs and views on the role of the ECPGs, and themselves as individuals in global health. Data were analysed descriptively.Results: Thirty national ECPGs across six regions of the World Health Organisation (WHO) participated in the survey. Most of the initiatives led by ECPGs focused on health and wellbeing, quality of education and part-nership. The most common activities were webinars, social events and partnerships with other organisations. In terms of global health challenges listed by the WHO, the most common initiatives led by ECPGs were related to medicines access and medicines safety. There was some involvement of early career pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, and ECPGs in the policy and regulation in their countries across various topics.Conclusion: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first global study exploring initiatives conducted by ECPGs. This study informed initiatives that have been implemented across regions, which could be useful for other ECPGs to initiate in their country according to their needs and priorities. Fostering engagement and collaboration between ECPGs is encouraged to provide opportunities and share learning across ECPGs, which could accelerate progress towards tackling global health challenges.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude, and practice among healthcare workers towards COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria.
   Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test.
   Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 +/- 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude.
   Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed. We recommend continuous public health education of HCWs on SARS-COV-2 infection control and prevention.

TI  - Analyzing Public Reactions, Perceptions, and Attitudes during the MPox Outbreak: Findings from Topic Modeling of Tweets
T2  - COMPUTERS
AB  - In the last decade and a half, the world has experienced outbreaks of a range of viruses such as COVID-19, H1N1, flu, Ebola, Zika virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), measles, and West Nile virus, just to name a few. During these virus outbreaks, the usage and effectiveness of social media platforms increased significantly, as such platforms served as virtual communities, enabling their users to share and exchange information, news, perspectives, opinions, ideas, and comments related to the outbreaks. Analysis of this Big Data of conversations related to virus outbreaks using concepts of Natural Language Processing such as Topic Modeling has attracted the attention of researchers from different disciplines such as Healthcare, Epidemiology, Data Science, Medicine, and Computer Science. The recent outbreak of the MPox virus has resulted in a tremendous increase in the usage of Twitter. Prior works in this area of research have primarily focused on the sentiment analysis and content analysis of these Tweets, and the few works that have focused on topic modeling have multiple limitations. This paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents the results of performing Topic Modeling on 601,432 Tweets about the 2022 Mpox outbreak that were posted on Twitter between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023. The results indicate that the conversations on Twitter related to Mpox during this time range may be broadly categorized into four distinct themes-Views and Perspectives about Mpox, Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, and Mpox and COVID-19. Second, the paper presents the findings from the analysis of these Tweets. The results show that the theme that was most popular on Twitter (in terms of the number of Tweets posted) during this time range was Views and Perspectives about Mpox. This was followed by the theme of Mpox and the LGBTQIA+ Community, which was followed by the themes of Mpox and COVID-19 and Updates on Cases and Investigations about Mpox, respectively. Finally, a comparison with related studies in this area of research is also presented to highlight the novelty and significance of this research work.

TI  - Determination of COVID-19 Phobia Level in Health Care Workers
T2  - SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the COVID-19 phobia level in healthcare workers. The socio-demographic characteristics form and the Coronavirus 19 Phobia (CP19-S) Scale were used as data collection tools. The surveys were shared online on social media. 467 healthcare workers who agreed to participate in the study were reached. Employees who got 55.30 +/- 14.64 points from the scale total scores and university graduates were found to have an average of 55.51 +/- 14.11, and their families averaged 57.84 +/- 15.05. As a result, it was determined that the COVID-19 phobia levels of healthcare workers were affected by situations such as gender, education level and elderly family members. In this case, the importance of determining the working areas of healthcare professionals according to their phobia levels is emphasized, as it will affect the quality of care given to patients during the pandemic process.

TI  - Passive Sensing of Preteens' Smartphone Use: An Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Cohort Substudy
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Concerns abound regarding childhood smartphone use, but studies to date have largely relied on self-reported screen use. Self-reporting of screen use is known to be misreported by pediatric samples and their parents, limiting the accurate determination of the impact of screen use on social, emotional, and cognitive development. Thus, a more passive, objective measurement of smartphone screen use among children is needed.
   Objective: This study aims to passively sense smartphone screen use by time and types of apps used in a pilot sample of children and to assess the feasibility of passive sensing in a larger longitudinal sample.
   Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study used passive, objective phone app methods for assessing smartphone screen use over 4 weeks in 2019-2020 in a subsample of 67 participants (aged 11-12 years; 31/67, 46% female; 23/67, 34% White). Children and their parents both reported average smartphone screen use before and after the study period, and they completed a questionnaire regarding the acceptability of the study protocol. Descriptive statistics for smartphone screen use, app use, and protocol feasibility and acceptability were reviewed. Analyses of variance were run to assess differences in categorical app use by demographics. Self-report and parent report were correlated with passive sensing data.
   Results: Self-report of smartphone screen use was partly consistent with objective measurement (r=0.49), although objective data indicated that children used their phones more than they reported. Passive sensing revealed the most common types of apps used were for streaming (mean 1 hour 57 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 32 minutes), communication (mean 48 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 17 minutes), gaming (mean 41 minutes per day, SD 41 minutes), and social media (mean 36 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 7 minutes). Passive sensing of smartphone screen use was generally acceptable to children (43/62, 69%) and parents (53/62, 85%).
   Conclusions: The results of passive, objective sensing suggest that children use their phones more than they self-report. Therefore, use of more robust methods for objective data collection is necessary and feasible in pediatric samples. These data may then more accurately reflect the impact of smartphone screen use on behavioral and emotional functioning. Accordingly, the ABCD study is implementing a passive sensing protocol in the full ABCD cohort. Taken together, passive assessment with a phone app provided objective, low-burden, novel, informative data about preteen smartphone screen use.

TI  - Sociodemographic and Health Belief Model Factors Associated with Nonadherence to COVID-19 Mitigation Strategies in the United States
T2  - ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background and Purpose Virus mitigation strategies such as adhering to stay-at-home orders, practicing social distancing, and engaging in personal protective behaviors are central to slowing the spread of COVID-19. This population-based cohort study sought to identify sociodemographic characteristics and Health Belief Model factors that are associated with nonadherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies with the goal of informing public health messaging campaigns.
   Methods An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020.
   Results Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities). Univariate analyses revealed that men, younger aged (18-30 years) and unmarried adults, and noncollege educated individuals had lower levels of perceived threat, control, and knowledge about COVID-19 (p <= .001). Multivariable linear regression models further revealed that male gender was significantly associated with reporting lower levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .001), and that higher levels of perceived threat, perceived control, and knowledge about how to keep oneself and others safe from COVID-19 were significantly associated with reporting higher levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .01).
   Conclusions Findings suggest that public health appeals that target men, emphasize individual risk, and provide clear, consistent guidance on what individuals can do to decrease their risk for COVID-19 may be effective in motivating increased mitigation adherence.

TI  - Cardio-Renal Syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF POPULATION THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The cardio-renal syndrome (CRS) can be generally defined as a pathophysiologic disorder includes a broad spectrum of diseases in which heart and kidney are both involved, the CRS classification essentially recognizes two main groups, cardio-renal and Reno-cardiac syndromes, on the basis of "premium moves" of disease (cardiac or renal); both cardio-renal and Reno-cardiac syndromes are then divided into acute and chronic, according to the disease's onset, Five subtypes of the syndromes were identified, abrupt worsening of cardiac function that lead to acute kidney injury called Acute Cardio-renal Syndrome or Type 1 CRS, this appears to be a syndrome of worsening renal function that frequently complicates hospitalized patients with acute heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. When Chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g. chronic congestive heart failure) cause progressive and potentially permanent chronic kidney disease this condition called chronic cardio-renal syndrome or Type 2 CRS, CKD has been observed in 45-63% of CHF patients24, 25, 26, [10]. The number of participants in the questionnaire is 100 and the questionnaire was distributed in two ways. In the first way, the questionnaire was published on social media and the number of participants was 79 and the number of pharmacists participating in the electronic questionnaire was 51 and the number of participating physicians was 28. In the second way, the questionnaire was distributed to a group of private pharmacies in Baghdad, which numbered 21 and purpose of the questionnaire was to find out if the participants had any information about Cardio-renal Syndrome. Heart and kidney interactions are complex and the subject of immense clinical and scientific interest and debate. In this article, we argue that without consensus on definitions and classification, clinicians will not be able to precisely phenotype the various forms of cardio-renal syndrome. Such phenotyping, in turn, forms the basis for in vitro and animal studies, as well as small translational studies in patients. Through the ADQI consensus on CRS, other processes will now be facilitated, including a better or clearer understanding of the epidemiology of these conditions, opportunities for early diagnosis through biomarkers, the development of preventive strategies and application of evidence-based management strategies

TI  - Exploring the Association Between the "Big Five" Personality Traits and Fatal Opioid Overdose: County-Level Empirical Analysis
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths constitute a problem of pandemic proportions in the United States, with no clear solution in sight. Although addressing addiction-the heart of this problem-ought to remain a priority for health practitioners, examining the community-level psychological factors with a known impact on health behaviors may provide valuable insights for attenuating this health crisis by curbing risky behaviors before they evolve into addiction.
   Objective: The goal of this study is twofold: to demonstrate the relationship between community-level psychological traits and fatal opioid overdose both theoretically and empirically, and to provide a blueprint for using social media data to glean these psychological factors in a real-time, reliable, and scalable manner.
   Methods: We collected annual panel data from Twitter for 2891 counties in the United States between 2014-2016 and used a novel data mining technique to obtain average county-level "Big Five" psychological trait scores. We then performed interval regression, using a control function to alleviate omitted variable bias, to empirically test the relationship between county-level psychological traits and the prevalence of fatal opioid overdoses in each county.
   Results: After controlling for a wide range of community-level biopsychosocial factors related to health outcomes, we found that three of the operationalizations of the five psychological traits examined at the community level in the study were significantly associated with fatal opioid overdoses: extraversion (beta=.308, P<.001), neuroticism (beta=.248, P<.001), and conscientiousness (beta=.229, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Analyzing the psychological characteristics of a community can be a valuable tool in the local, state, and national fight against the opioid pandemic. Health providers and community health organizations can benefit from this research by evaluating the psychological profile of the communities they serve and assessing the projected risk of fatal opioid overdose based on the relationships our study predict when making decisions for the allocation of overdose-reversal medication and other vital resources.

TI  - A cross-sectional survey on attitudes of men who have sex with men towards anal self-examination for detection of anal syphilis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Studies suggest men who have sex with men (MSM) practising receptive anal sex are more likely to present with secondary syphilis, implying primary anorectal lesions are likely to be missed. If men could detect anorectal lesions in the primary stage by regular anal self-examination (ASE), transmission could be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to explore the attitudes of MSM on performing ASE to detect primary anorectal syphilis. An online anonymous cross-sectional survey among MSM over 18 years of age living in Australia, was conducted between July and November 2020 and recruitment was from a sexual health clinic and social media. A total of 568 MSM completed the survey (median age: 34 [IQR 27-45]): 32% (183) had previously performed ASE. Among 66% (374) who had never performed ASE, 68% (250) would consider performing ASE in the future with a preferred median frequency of 2 times per 4 weeks (IQR 1-4), whilst men who were already performing ASE were performing it at median 1 per 4 weeks (IQR 0.2-3). Almost two-thirds of MSM who had never performed ASE were willing to adopt ASE practice in the future. Studies are required to determine the effectiveness of ASE for syphilis detection.

TI  - Trends in generalised anxiety disorders and symptoms in primary care: UK population-based cohort study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background
   Generalised anxiety disorder and symptoms are associated with poor physical, emotional and social functioning and frequent primary and acute care visits. We investigated recent temporal trends in anxiety and related mental illness in UK general practice.
   Aims
   The aims of this analysis are to examine temporal changes in recording of generalised anxiety in primary care and initial pharmacologic treatments.
   Method
   Annual incidence rates of generalised anxiety diagnoses and symptoms were calculated from 795 UK general practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database between 1998 and 2018. Poisson mixed regression was used to account for age, gender and general practitioner practice. Subsequent pharmacologic treatment was examined.
   Results
   Generalised anxiety recording rates increased in both genders aged 18-24 between 2014 and 2018. For women, the increase was from 17.06 to 23.33/1000 person years at risk (PYAR); for men, 8.59 to 11.65/1000 PYAR. Increases persisted for a composite of anxiety and depression (49.74 to 57.81/1000 PYAR for women; 25.41 to 31.45/1000 PYAR for men). Smaller increases in anxiety were seen in both genders age 25-34 and 35-44. Anxiety rates among older patients remained stable, although a composite of anxiety and depression decreased for older women. About half of drug-naive patients were prescribed anxiety drugs within 1 year following diagnosis. The most common choice was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Benzodiazepine prescription rate has fallen steadily.
   Conclusions
   We observed a substantial increase in general practitioner consulting for generalised anxiety and depression recently, concentrated within younger people and in particular women.

TI  - Frequent discussion of insomnia and weight gain with glucocorticoid therapy: an analysis of Twitter posts
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - In recent years, social media websites have been suggested as a novel, vast source of data which may be useful for deriving drug safety information. Despite this, there are few published reports of drug safety profiles derived in this way. The aims of this study were to detect and quantify glucocorticoid-related adverse events using a computerised system for automated detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) from narrative text in Twitter, and to compare the frequency of specific ADR mentions within Twitter to the frequency and patterns of spontaneous ADR reporting to a national drug regulatory body. Of 159,297 tweets mentioning either prednisolone or prednisone between 1st October 2012 and 30th June 2015, 20,206 tweets were deemed to contain information resembling an ADR. The top AE MedDRA (R) Preferred Terms were 'insomnia' and 'weight increased', both recognised non-serious but common side effects. These were proportionally over-reported in Twitter when compared to spontaneous reports in the UK regulator's ADR reporting scheme. Serious glucocorticoid related AEs were reported less frequently. Pharmacovigilance using Twitter data has the potential to be a valuable, supplementary source of drug safety information. In particular, it can illustrate which drug side effects patients discuss most commonly, potentially because of important impacts on quality of life. This information could help clinicians to inform patients about frequent and relevant non-serious side effects as well as more serious side effects.

TI  - "This is some mess right here": Exploring interactions between Black sexual minority women and health care providers for breast cancer screening and care
T2  - CANCER
AB  - Background Few studies have explored how the intersection of race and sexual identity contribute to breast cancer disparities for Black sexual minority women (SMW). Issues within patient-provider relationships, including bias, contribute to health disparities for minority groups. The authors used constructs from self-determination theory (SDT) to explore the nature of health care provider interactions in breast cancer screening and care among Black SMW. Methods Participants were sampled nationally through social media, targeted emails, and referrals. Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 Black cisgender SMW, ages 38 to 64 years, who had a breast cancer diagnosis or recent abnormal mammogram. Interviews were conducted face-to-face or online, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Two analysts coded the interviews. Codes were analyzed across interviews to identify themes salient to SDT. Results Themes aligned with the SDT constructs of relatedness and autonomy. Some participants discussed feeling most understood by Black and/or female providers who shared at least 1 of their identities. Feeling understood through shared identity contributed to participants feeling seen and heard by their providers. Participants who discussed negative experiences with providers believed that the provider made negative assumptions about them based on their race and/or sexual orientation. Conclusions When interacting with health care providers for breast cancer screening and care, Black SMW face specific challenges related to their multiply marginalized social position. Reducing health care provider bias toward Black SMW may improve patients' desires to continue in care. Providing equitable care while acknowledging and respecting women with multiply marginalized identities may improve the nature of these interactions.

TI  - Health Disparities in Staphylococcus aureus Transmission and Carriage in a Border Region of the United States Based on Cultural Differences in Social Relationships: Protocol for a Survey Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Health care-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term goal is to use risk-based information from empirical socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors.
   Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2) evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission of S aureus.
   Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history, etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S aureus transmission.
   Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on the original funded design for this project (#NIH U54MD012388). That design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337 individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined data monitoring procedures.
   Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of S aureus carriage and transmission.

TI  - Trends in depression prevalence in the USA from 2005 to 2015: widening disparities in vulnerable groups
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background. Major depression is associated with significant disability, morbidity, and mortality. The current study estimated trends in the prevalence of major depression in the US population from 2005 to 2015 overall and by demographic subgroups.
   Methods. Data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of US persons ages 12 and over (total analytic sample N = 607 520). Past-year depression prevalence was examined annually among respondents from 2005 to 2015. Time trends in depression prevalence stratified by survey year were tested using logistic regression. Data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and education.
   Results. Depression prevalence increased significantly in the USA from 2005 to 2015, before and after controlling for demographics. Increases in depression were significant for the youngest and oldest age groups, men, and women, Non-Hispanic White persons, the lowest income group, and the highest education and income groups. A significant year x demographic interaction was found for age. The rate of increase in depression was significantly more rapid among youth relative to all older age groups.
   Conclusions. The prevalence of depression increased significantly in the USA from 2005 to 2015. The rate of increase in depression among youth was significantly more rapid relative to older groups. Further research into understanding the macro level, micro level, and individual factors that are contributing to the increase in depression, including factors specific to demographic subgroups, would help to direct public health prevention and intervention efforts.

TI  - Probable depression and suicidal ideation in Hong Kong amid massive civil unrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: This study examined prevalence and correlates of probable depression and suicidal ideation among Hong Kong Chinese residents amidst the anti-extradition bill protests.
   Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of Hong Kong residents aged 15 years or older during the first three weeks of July, 2019. Respondents reported current depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, participation in protest activities, attitudes and perceived stress, disruptions to daily routines, and demographics.
   Results: Among 1112 respondents, 25.7% reported probable depression, and 9.1% reported suicidal ideation. Multivariable logistic regression showed that persons with higher odds of probable depression had primary education and high disruptions to regular routines of eating, sleep, socializing, and leisure activities. Persons who were at higher odds of suicidal ideation had lower household income, used social media to engage in the protests, and had medium or high disruptions to regular eating and sleep.
   Conclusions: During the anti-extradition bill protests, the prevalence of probable depression and suicidal ideation were substantially higher than would be expected and higher than during the Umbrella Movement of 2014. Psychiatric morbidity may be a consequence of massive social movements, particularly among persons with limited protective resources whose daily life is disrupted by these events.

TI  - Markup: A Web-Based Annotation Tool Powered by Active Learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Across various domains, such as health and social care, law, news, and social media, there are increasing quantities of unstructured texts being produced. These potential data sources often contain rich information that could be used for domain-specific and research purposes. However, the unstructured nature of free-text data poses a significant challenge for its utilisation due to the necessity of substantial manual intervention from domain-experts to label embedded information. Annotation tools can assist with this process by providing functionality that enables the accurate capture and transformation of unstructured texts into structured annotations, which can be used individually, or as part of larger Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. We present Markup (https:// www.getmarkup.com/) an open-source, web-based annotation tool that is undergoing continued development for use across all domains. Markup incorporates NLP and Active Learning (AL) technologies to enable rapid and accurate annotation using custom user configurations, predictive annotation suggestions, and automated mapping suggestions to both domain-specific ontologies, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and custom, user-defined ontologies. We demonstrate a real-world use case of how Markup has been used in a healthcare setting to annotate structured information from unstructured clinic letters, where captured annotations were used to build and test NLP applications.

TI  - Regional and socioeconomic predictors of perceived ability to access coronavirus testing in the United States: results from a nationwide online COVID-19 survey
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: Access to COVID-19 testing remained a salient issue during the early months of the pandemic, therefore this study aimed to identify 1) regional and 2) socioeconomic predictors of perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Methods: An online survey using social media-based advertising was conducted among U.S. adults in April 2020. Participants were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test, along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information.
   Results: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access to COVID-19 testing. In adjusted analyses, we found higher income and possession of health insurance to be associated with perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Geographically, perceived access was highest (68%) in East South Central division and lowest (39%) in West North Central. Disparities in health insurance coverage did not directly correspond to disparities in perceived access to COVID-19 testing.
   Conclusions: Sex, geographic location, income, and insurance status were associated with perceived access to COVID-19 testing; interventions aimed at improving either access or awareness of measures taken to improve access are warranted. These findings from the pandemic's early months shed light on the importance of disaggregating perceived and true access to screening during such crises.

TI  - Out-of-season increase of puerperal fever with group A <i>Streptococcus</i> infection: a case-control study, Netherlands, July to August 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
AB  - We observed an increase in notifications of puerperal group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in July and August 2018 throughout the Netherlands without evidence for common sources. General practitioners reported a simultaneous increase in impetigo. We hypothesised that the outbreak of puerperal GAS infections resulted from increased exposure via impetigo in the community.
   We conducted a case-control study to assess peripartum exposure to possible, non-invasive GAS infections using an online questionnaire. Confirmed cases were recruited through public health services while probable cases and controls were recruited through social media. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with logistic regression analysis.
   We enrolled 22 confirmed and 23 probable cases, and 2,400 controls. Contact with persons with impetigo were reported by 8% of cases and 2% of controls (OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 0.98-10.88) and contact with possible GAS infections (impetigo, pharyngitis or scarlet fever) by 28% and 9%, respectively (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 1.95-8.68). In multivariable analysis, contact with possible GAS infections remained an independent risk factor (a0R: 4.28, 95% CI: 2.02-9.09).
   We found an increased risk of puerperal fever after community contact with possible non-invasive GAS infections. Further study of this association is warranted.

TI  - What are patients asking and reading online? An analysis of online patient searches for rotator cuff repair
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY
AB  - Background: Patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery often search the internet for information regarding the procedure. One popular source, Google, compiles frequently asked questions and links to websites that may provide answers. This study provides an analysis of the most frequently searched questions associated with rotator cuff surgery. We hypothesize that there will be distinct search patterns associated with online queries about rotator cuff surgery that could provide unique insights into patient concerns. Methods: A set of search terms were entered into Google Web Search using a clean-install Google Chrome browser. Frequently associated questions and their webpages were extracted to a database via a data mining extension. Questions were categorized by topics relevant for rotator cuff arthroscopy. Websites were categorized by source and scored for quality using the JAMA Benchmark Criteria. Pearson's x(2) tests were used to analyze nominal data. Student t tests were performed to compare JAMA Benchmark Scores.Results: Of the 595 questions generated from the initial search, 372 unique questions associated with 293 websites were extracted and categorized. The most popular question topics were activities/restrictions (20.7%), pain (18.8%), and indications/management (13.2%). The 2 most common websites searched were academic (35.2%) and medical practice (27.4%). Commercial websites were significantly more likely to be associated with questions about cost (57.1% of all cost questions, P = .01), anatomy/function (62.5%, P = .001), and evaluation of surgery (47.6%, P < .001). Academic websites were more likely to be associated with questions about technical details of surgery (58.1%, P < .001). Medical practice and social media websites were more likely associated with activities/restrictions (48.1%, P < .001, and 15.6%, P < .001, respectively). Government websites were more likely associated with timeline of recovery (12.8%, P = .01). On a scale of 0-4, commercial and academic websites had the highest JAMA scores (3.06 and 2.39, respectively). Conclusion: Patients seeking information regarding rotator cuff repair primarily use the Google search engine to ask questions regarding postoperative activity and restrictions, followed by pain, indications, and management. Academic websites, which were associated with technical details of surgery, and medical practice websites, which were associated with activities/restrictions, were the 2 most commonly searched resources. These results emphasize the need for orthopedic surgeons to provide detailed and informative instructions to patients undergoing rotator cuff repair, especially in the postoperativeLevel of evidence: Survey Study; Internet Sources (c) 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

TI  - Validation of the Spanish version of the body vigilance scale
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the body vigilance scale (BVS). The recruitment has been performed through an online survey launched through common social media.
   Material and Methods: All subjects were older than 18 years and affected by panic disorder as a self-reported diagnosis. 367 individuals were rated for the validation analysis. BVS has been translated into Spanish and validated through confirmatory factor analysis. Participants have been also scored with the self-report panic disorder severity scale (PDSS-SR). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test was adequate (KMO=0.0887) and sphericity tested significantly (p<0.001). The confirmatory analysis confirmed that the scale is one-dimensional.
   Results: The model adjustment was good, according to all fit indices. Cronbach's alpha also confirmed an excellent internal consistency (alpha=0.985). Scores between the two scales (BVS and PDSS-SR) have shown a good convergence (r=0.898; p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The Spanish version of the BVS has shown good psychometric properties and adequately reproduce the one-dimensional model of the original English version.

TI  - Willingness of children and adolescents to have a COVID-19 vaccination: Results of a large whole schools survey in England
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy has affected COVID-19 adult vaccination programs in many countries. Data on hesitancy amongst child and adolescent populations is largely confined to parent opinion. We investigated the characteristics of vaccine hesitant children and adolescents using results from a large, school-based selfreport survey of the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccination in students aged 9 -18 years in England. Methods: Data from the OxWell Student Survey on mental health, life experiences and behaviours were used, collected from four counties across England. Local authority partners recruited schools. The vaccine hesitancy question gave six response options and were clustered to inform delivery: eager and willing were categorised as vaccination 'opt-in', don't know and not bothered categorised as 'undecided', and unwilling and antivaccination categorised as 'opt-out'. We conducted a multinomial regression to determine associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic, health behaviour and social connection variables. Findings: 27,910 students from 180 schools answered the vaccine hesitancy question between 14th May and 21st July 2021, of whom 13984 (50.1%) would opt-in to take a vaccination, 10322 (37.0%) were undecided, and 3604 (12.9%) would opt-out. A lower percentage of younger students reported that they would opt-in to vaccination, for example, 35.7% of 9-year-olds and 51.3% of 13-year-olds compared to 77.8% of 17-year-olds would opt-in to take a vaccination. Students who were 'opt-out' or 'undecided' (a combined 'vaccine hesitant' group) were more likely to come from deprived socioeconomic contexts with higher rates of home rental versus home ownership and their school locations were more likely to be in areas of greater deprivation. They were more likely to smoke or vape, spend longer on social media, feel that they did not belong in their school community but had lower levels of anxiety and depression. The vaccine hesitant students- the undecided and opt-out groups- were similar in profile, although the opt-out students had higher reported confirmed or probable previous COVID-19 infection than the opt-in group, whereas those undecided, did not. Interpretation: If government vaccination strategies move towards vaccinating younger school-aged students, efforts to increase vaccination uptake may be necessary. Compared with students who would opt-in, those who were vaccine hesitant had greater indicators of social deprivation and felt a lack of community cohesion by not feeling a sense of belonging at their school. There were indications that those students who would opt-out had higher levels of marginalisation and mistrust. If programmes are rolled out, focus on hesitant younger students will be important, targeting more marginalised and deprived young people with information from trusted sources utilising social media; improving access to vaccination centres with provision both in and outside school; and addressing fears and worries about the effects of the vaccine. The main limitation of this study is that the participant group may not be wholly representative of England or the UK, which may bias population-level estimates of willingness to be vaccinated.

TI  - Mathematical modelling and analysis of alcohol-methamphetamine co-abuse in the Western Cape Province of South Africa
T2  - COGENT MATHEMATICS & STATISTICS
AB  - Substance/drug abuse poses a significant threat to the health and socio-economic fabric of individuals and nations. The combined abuse of alcohol and the highly addictive methamphetamine has worsened the drug epidemic in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape province. In this paper, a mathematical model is formulated to model the dynamics of alcohol and methamphetamine co-abuse. We prove that the equilibria of the submodels are locally and globally asymptotically stable when the sub-model threshold parameters are less than unity. The basic reproduction number due to co-abuse is shown to be the maximum of the two sub-model reproduction numbers. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the most sensitive parameters in the co-abuse epidemic are the alcohol and methamphetamine recruitment rates B-1 and B-2 respectively. The prevalence curve is indicative of a persistent drug problem in the region. Hence, the need to promote social programs that raise awareness of the dangers posed by multiple substance abuse, through educational campaigns in learning institutions, social media and health institutions. Transmission control must focus on enhancing the quitting process while promoting support services to drug users during and after treatment to minimize cases of relapse.

TI  - Prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain in Saudi Arabia
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) in a sample of the general adult population in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional online survey (N=24,265). Forty data collectors from 5 regions of Saudi Arabia approached people to complete the questionnaires through different social media applications, using a validated survey in Arabic language.
   Results: Chronic pain and HICP prevalences in the Saudi adult population were found to be 46.4% (CP) and 4% (HICP), with a higher prevalence among women and elderly. Chronic back pain was the most reported pain location. Half of the respondents reported dissatisfaction with pain services. Greater prevalence of HICP was found among women, elderly, unemployed, and those with low-income status. Patients with HICP were more likely to have more healthcare utilization and have more negative impacts on their physical and psychological wellbeing.
   Conclusion: Chronic pain and HICP are common in Saudi Arabia, especially among females and elderly, suggesting a public health problem. This calls for collaborative efforts at various levels of the social hierarchy to ensure the provision of effective management of CP in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - The Effect of Using Rome IV Criteria on the Prevalence of Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders and Functional Constipation among Children of the Western Region of Saudi Arabia
T2  - GLOBAL PEDIATRIC HEALTH
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by absence of anatomical and biochemical alterations, and are diagnosed and classified based on symptomatology. We aim to explore the prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders and Functional constipation using Rome IV criteria. An online questionnaire was distributed randomly via social media targeting the general population of the western region of Saudi Arabia. Parents who have at least 1 child in the age group 3 to 18 years were included. Children with mental disabilities, or any organic gastrointestinal disorder were excluded. Five hundred thirty-two responded and 215 were excluded. The overall prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders was 3.1%. The prevalence of functional constipation was 4.7%. Conclusions: Rome IV criteria seems to give a lower functional abdominal pain prevalence than Rome III, online learning did not seem to affect the prevalence of both disorders, but a family stressor seems to increase functional constipation prevalence.

TI  - Quinary prevention in diabetes care: Need for multidisciplinary approach
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Problem considered: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global pandemic with increasing prevalence worldwide. Hearsay, or reported speech, is an important contributor to diabetes care related behavior and may influence the outcomes of diabetes treatment. An emerging concept in preventive medicine is Quinary prevention which aims at preventing health-related hearsay or misinformation.
   Methods: A group of international clinical experts comprising endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists and community medicine specialists gathered in India and discussed ways to restrain the menace of de-hearsay in diabetes care.
   Results: Based on the discussion, the expert panel endorsed the term "quinary prevention" which is a mode of preventing the spread of false health information. The panel also outlined several means through which the physician community can prevent the spread of misinformation.
   Conclusions: Considering the increasing use of technology by the general population, treating health care pro-fessionals should keep updating with the newer research evidences in their fields and disseminate authentic knowledge on diabetes care on social media, print media as well as other mass media, thereby diabetes pro-moting self-management, as well as public health.

TI  - Malodors as environmental injustice: health symptoms in the aftermath of a hydrogen sulfide emergency in Carson, California, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - In October 2021, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a toxic odorous gas, was measured in Carson, California at concentrations reaching 7000 parts per billion (ppb), exceeding California's 30 ppb acute air quality standard. Thousands of residents complained of malodors and headaches. We responded to community concerns by launching a rapid survey assessing symptoms. We recruited participants through door-to-door outreach, community events, and social media. During the emergency's first week, 75% of the 108 total respondents experienced headaches, 72% experienced dizziness, and 63% experienced difficulty sleeping. About 60% of respondents (n = 63, no response = 7) noted the odor worsening their mental health. When adjusting for age, sex, and smoking, participants <2 km from the highest H2S concentrations reported higher prevalence of agitation (PD = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.42) and headaches (PR = 0.14, 95% CI: -0.04, 1.31) compared to participants farther away. Malodors are underprioritized in environmental justice communities, despite H2S's effects on mental and physical health.

TI  - Workplace contact patterns in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: Analysis of the Virus Watch prospective cohort study
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
AB  - Background Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings. Findings Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75-81%]) and education workers (64% [59%-69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%-40%] and 38% [33%-43%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51% [44%-57%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent restrictions. Interpretation Major variations in workplace contact patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk. Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community transmission and emergence of variants.

TI  - Identifying target areas for risk-based surveillance and control of transboundary animal diseases: a seasonal analysis of slaughter and live-trade cattle movements in Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.

TI  - A large-scale location-based social network to understanding the impact of human geo-social interaction patterns on vaccination strategies in an urbanized area
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB  - Cities play an important role in fostering and amplifying the transmission of airborne diseases (e.g., influenza) because of dense human contacts. Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geo-social interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source. This research can provide evidence to inform public health approaches to determine effective scales in the design of disease control strategies.

TI  - Feasibility of national living guideline methods: The Australian Stroke Guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Maintaining clinical guideline currency has been one challenge to traditional guideline development. This paper describes the methods used to maintain a large national guideline for stroke management. Study design and setting: The Australian Stroke Clinical Guidelines are developed to meet Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) standards. Monthly surveillance is conducted for new systematic reviews and randomised controlled studies. Included studies undergo data extraction followed by preparation of updated evidence-to-decision frameworks which are used to inform updates, or development of new recommendations. Small writing groups made up of clinical experts and those with lived experience review and agree on changes, which are finally reviewed by a multidisciplinary Guidelines Steering Group. Draft changes are developed and published using the online MAGICapp platform, with dissemination and promotion via traditional methods as well as social media. Results: Each month approximately 350 abstracts are considered, covering 96 clinical topics and taking on average 16 h to review. There have been four major guideline updates covering 34 new and updated recommendations. Conclusion: It is feasible to use 'living' methods to maintain the Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management. Further work is now needed to understand the impact of living guidelines.

TI  - Systematic reviewers used various approaches to data extraction and expressed several research needs: a survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Data extraction is a prerequisite for analyzing, summarizing, and interpreting evidence in systematic reviews. Yet guidance is limited, and little is known about current approaches. We surveyed systematic reviewers on their current approaches to data extraction, opinions on methods, and research needs.Study Design and Setting: We developed a 29-question online survey and distributed it through relevant organizations, social media, and personal networks in 2022. Closed questions were evaluated using descriptive statistics, and open questions were analyzed using con-tent analysis.Results: 162 reviewers participated. Use of adapted (65%) or newly developed extraction forms (62%) was common. Generic forms were rarely used (14%). Spreadsheet software was the most popular extraction tool (83%). Piloting was reported by 74% of respondents and included a variety of approaches. Independent and duplicate extraction was considered the most appropriate approach to data collection (64%). About half of respondents agreed that blank forms and/or raw data should be published. Suggested research gaps were the effects of different methods on error rates (60%) and the use of data extraction support tools (46%).Conclusion: Systematic reviewers used varying approaches to pilot data extraction. Methods to reduce errors and use of support tools such as (semi-)automation tools are top research gaps.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Decision-Making concerning Involuntary Oral Care for Older Individuals with Dementia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Many older individuals with dementia (OIWD) show care-resistant behavior for oral care. Providing care despite resistance is considered to be involuntary care. Although involuntary care should be minimized, in some OIWD it may be necessary to avoid health risks. This study aims to assess the attitudes of healthcare providers with regard to involuntary oral care provision for OIWD who show care-resistant behavior. An online questionnaire consisting of general questions and case specific questions was administered via social media and networking to individuals involved in the oral care of OIWD. A total of 309 participants were included in this study. The outcomes of the questionnaires were categorized per case. In all cases, a discrepancy was seen between the assessment of oral health problems as potentially harmful (range: 73.1-93.5%) and the willingness to provide involuntary care (range: 31.1-63.4%). Hence, many healthcare providers are aware of the subsequent potential health risks related to not providing care, but are still reluctant to provide involuntary oral care. Therefore, many OIWD who show care-resistant behavior potentially do not receive the necessary oral care they require.

TI  - Awareness of head and neck cancers in Saudi Arabia <i>A questionnaire based study</i>
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To address the gap in knowledge by providing data and analyses of the status of awareness among Saudi adults.
   Methods: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was carried out in Saudi Arabia from August 2018 to August 2019 through social media platforms using SurveyMonkey. The domains of the questionnaire included demographic information, knowledge of types and symptoms of head and neck cancers (HNCs), and the relation of HNCs to human papillomavirus (HPV) and its vaccine.
   Results: A total of 3171 respondents completed the questionnaire. The analysis revealed that many of the study respondents (49.3%) were not knowledgeable about HNCs. Almost two-thirds (61.2%) of the study population incorrectly believed that brain cancer was included in HNCs. Over half (57.8%) did not recognize headaches as a symptom. In terms of the risk factors, males showed higher awareness of tobacco and excessive alcohol as risk factors, while females were more knowledgeable about HPV infection (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: This study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge and awareness of the clinical features of and risk factors for HNCs among the Saudi population.

TI  - Rates of family history of autism and ADHD varies with recruitment approach and socio-economic status
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Family history (FH) of autism and ADHD is not often considered during the recruitment process of developmental studies, despite high recurrence rates. We looked at the rate of autism or ADHD amongst family members of young children (9 to 46 months) in three UK-based samples (N = 1055) recruited using different methods. The rate of FH-autism or FH-ADHD was 3%-9% for diagnosed cases. The rate was highest in the sample recruited through an online participant pool, which also consisted of the most socio-economically diverse families. Lower parental education and family income were associated with higher rates of FH-ADHD and lower parental education with increased FH-autism. Thus, recruitment strategies have a meaningful impact on neurodiversity and the conclusions and generalizations that can be drawn. Specifically, recruitment using crowdsourcing websites could create a sample that is more representative of the wider population, compared to those recruited through university-related volunteer databases and social media.

TI  - Exploring determinants of care-seeking behaviour of oral cancer patients in India: A qualitative content analysis
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: A major public health concern in India is the high morbidity and mortality rates of oral cancer because of late diagnosis. Among the several determinants of this late diagnosis, the most important is the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the oral cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore the care-seeking behaviour and its determinants among oral cancer patients.
   Methods: A face-to-face in-depth interview was conducted among 70 oral cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire, and qualitative content analysis of the results was performed.
   Results: All the patients had squamous-cell carcinoma and none had attended any screening programme. The most common site affected was the buccal mucosa with a non-healing wound. Most of the patients contacted a doctor available nearby; only 7% of patients consulted a dentist. Only one patient approached a traditional healer. The median patient delay was 30 (4-365) days and the professional delay was 40 (4-650) days. Enablers included determinants such as increasing symptoms (80%), influence of the society (74%), fear (10%), and social media (3%). The main barriers were lack of awareness (97%), hope that the lesion will heal spontaneously (90%), lack of perception of seriousness (64%), financial constraints (55%), provider switching (47%), and missed diagnosis (44%).
   Conclusion: The care-seeking path among oral cancer patients is complex, customised, and influenced by multiple patient-related and system-related factors.

TI  - Trust Associated with South Korean Sojourners' Chinese COVID-19 Vaccination Intent and Concerns: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - People's willingness to get vaccinated determines whether the campaigns against the COVID-19 pandemic can be successful in part. Considering the fact that both foreigners and its nationals are exposed to the risk of infection in China, the Chinese government has taken measures favorable to foreigners in terms of the vaccination, yet South Korean sojourners were reluctant to get China-developed COVID-19 vaccines. This study employed the trust in institutions and trust in media as a theoretical framework and seeks to analyze how these two affect South Korean sojourners' intention to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. 25 South Korean sojourners living in Beijing participated in semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the mistrust South Korean sojourners have in China's institutions and media, both traditional and social media, led to their reluctance to get Chinese COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, South Korean sojourners' higher interpersonal trust in their peers also influenced their willingness to get vaccines. This study further interpreted such results from the perspective of cultural traits and national properties.

TI  - Exploring the mediating effect of camouflaging and the moderating effect of autistic identity on the relationship between autistic traits and mental wellbeing
T2  - AUTISM RESEARCH
AB  - Mental health difficulties are prevalent among autistic adults. Camouflaging (behaving differently to fit in) may be a mechanism by which autistic traits and mental health difficulties relate to each other, but little research has considered the role of different facets of camouflaging. Additionally, autistic identity might buffer against camouflaging and mental health difficulties. This research aims to explore the mediating effects of camouflaging behaviours on the relationship between autistic traits and both positive and negative mental wellbeing, as well as how autistic identity might moderate the relationship between autistic traits and camouflaging, and also mental health. Data were available for 627 autistic adults, recruited through volunteer databases and social media. Participants completed measures of autistic traits, anxiety, depression, positive wellbeing, camouflaging behaviours (compensating for difficulties, masking, and assimilating/putting on an act) and autistic identity. Mediation and moderated mediation models were tested, applying 95% bootstrapped CIs (10,000 resamples) and including age, gender and diagnosis as covariates. There were no significant direct effects between autistic traits and mental wellbeing. Assimilation was a significant mediator of all mental wellbeing measures, and compensation was a significant mediator of positive wellbeing only. Autistic identity was not a significant moderator. Assimilation and compensation should be considered when offering psychological interventions to support mental wellbeing of autistic people. Additional research into external drivers of camouflaging (e.g. stigma) and mechanisms by which camouflaging impacts mental wellbeing, such as autonomy, authenticity, skill mastery and community, may identify other areas of support. Concurrently, societal change is necessary to reduce the need to camouflage.
   Putting on an act to fit in is linked to worse depression, anxiety, suicidality, and positive wellbeing. Compensating for difficulties is linked to better positive wellbeing. A positive autistic identity did not change this. We should explore why changing how you act and compensating have this effect, so we can give better support and improve wellbeing for autistic people. We should also reduce stigma from society, so autistic people do not need to change their behaviour to try to fit in.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between job characteristics and infection: Application of a COVID-19 job exposure matrix to SARS-CoV-2 infection data in the United Kingdom
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF WORK ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH
AB  - Objective This study aimed to assess whether workplace exposures as estimated via a COVID-19 job exposure matrix (JEM) are associated with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.Methods Data on 244 470 participants were available from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infec-tion Survey (CIS) and 16 801 participants from the Virus Watch Cohort, restricted to workers aged 20-64 years. Analysis used logistic regression models with SARS-CoV-2 as the dependent variable for eight individual JEM domains (number of workers, nature of contacts, contact via surfaces, indoor or outdoor location, ability to social distance, use of face covering, job insecurity, and migrant workers) with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation (IMD), region, household size, urban versus rural area, and health conditions. Analyses were repeated for three time periods (i) February 2020 (Virus Watch)/April 2020 (CIS) to May 2021), (ii) June 2021 to November 2021, and (iii) December 2021 to January 2022.Results Overall, higher risk classifications for the first six domains tended to be associated with an increased risk of infection, with little evidence of a relationship for domains relating to proportion of workers with job insecurity or migrant workers. By time there was a clear exposure-response relationship for these domains in the first period only. Results were largely consistent across the two UK cohorts.Conclusions An exposure-response relationship exists in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic for number of contacts, nature of contacts, contacts via surfaces, indoor or outdoor location, ability to social distance and use of face coverings. These associations appear to have diminished over time.

TI  - Current status of liver surgery for non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases: the NON.LI.MET. Italian Society for Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE) and Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe (ACIE) collaborative international survey
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
AB  - Despite the increasing trend in liver resections for non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases (NCNNLM), the role of surgery for these liver malignancies is still debated. Registries are an essential, reliable tool for assessing epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approach in a single hub, especially when data are dispersive and inconclusive, as in our case. The dissemination of this preliminary survey would allow us to understand if the creation of an International Registry is a viable option, while still offering a snapshot on this issue, investigating clinical practices worldwide. The steering committee designed an online questionnaire with Google Forms, which consisted of 37 questions, and was open from October 5th, 2022, to November 30th, 2022. It was disseminated using social media and mailing lists of the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE), the Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe (ACIE), and the Spanish Chapter of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Overall, 141 surgeons (approximately 18% of the total invitations sent) from 27 countries on four continents participated in the survey. Most respondents worked in general surgery units (62%), performing less than 50 liver resections/year (57%). A multidisciplinary discussion was currently performed to validate surgical indications for NCNNLM in 96% of respondents. The most commonly adopted selection criteria were liver resectability, RECIST criteria, and absence of extrahepatic disease. Primary tumors were generally of gastrointestinal (42%), breast (31%), and pancreaticobiliary origin (13%). The most common interventions were parenchymal-sparing resections (51% of respondents) of metachronous metastases with an open approach. Major post-operative complications (Clavien-Dindo > 2) occurred in up to 20% of the procedures, according to 44% of respondents. A subset analysis of data from high-volume centers (> 100 cases/year) showed lower post-operative complications and better survival. The present survey shows that NCNNLM patients are frequently treated by surgeons in low-volume hospitals for liver surgery. Selection criteria are usually based on common sense. Liver resections are performed mainly with an open approach, possibly carrying a high burden of major post-operative complications. International guidelines and a specific consensus on this field are desirable, as well as strategies for collaboration between high-volume and low-volume centers. The present study can guide the elaboration of a multi-institutional document on the optimal pathway in the management of patients with NCNNLM.

TI  - Study protocol of the Edinburgh and Lothian Virus Intervention Study in Kids: a randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline nose drops in children with upper respiratory tract infections (ELVIS Kids)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Edinburgh and Lothians' Viral Intervention Study Kids is a parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline (HS) nose drops (similar to 2.6% sodium chloride) vs standard care in children <7 years of age with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).
   Methods and analysis Children are recruited prior to URTI or within 48 hours of developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local schools/nurseries, health centres/hospitals, recreational facilities, public events, workplaces, local/social media. Willing parents/guardians, of children <7 years of age will be asked to contact the research team at their local site. Children will be randomised to either a control arm (standard symptomatic care), or intervention arm (three drops/nostril of HS, at least four times a day, until 24 hours after asymptomatic or a maximum of 28 days). All participants are requested to provide a nasal swab at the start of the study (intervention arm: before HS drops) and then daily for four more days. Parent/guardian complete a validated daily diary, an end of illness diary, a satisfaction questionnaire and a wheeze questionnaire (day 28). The parent/guardian of a child in the intervention arm is taught to prepare HS nose drops. Parent/guardian of children asymptomatic at recruitment are requested to inform the research team within 48 hours of their child developing an URTI and follow the instructions already provided. The day 28 questionnaire determines if the child experienced a wheeze following illness. Participation in the study ends on day 28.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (18/WS/0080). It is cosponsored by Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development-a partnership between the University of Edinburgh and National Health Service Lothian Health Board. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and via the study website.

TI  - The prevalence of facial pressure injuries among nurses during COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship to COVID-19 infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF TISSUE VIABILITY
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of facial pressure injuries related to personal pro-tective equipment use in nurses and the relationship with getting COVID-19 infection.Design: The study used descriptive and correlational online survey design.Methods: Nurses in Turkey were recruited via an electronic link sent to their social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), WhatsApp, and e-mail during the study: March-April 2021. Of them, 603 par-ticipants completed the survey form from all over Turkey.Results/Findings: Facial pressure injuries develop in nurses due to use of personal protective equipment. The rates of facial pressure injuries were higher in the nurses who were younger (p=0.002) and those who had less experience years (p=0.005) than the other nurses. The statistically significant variables were determined as age, status of using face shield, status of wearing overalls and status of wearing shoe covers (p<0.05). We determined that facial pressure injuries were not significantly associated with getting COVID-19 infection (p>0,05).Conclusions: This study showed that facial pressure injuries associated with personal protective equipment use among nurses, who work on the frontlines in the COVID-19 pandemic period, is highly prevalent. Experiencing facial pressure injuries did not have a significant effect on the participants' statuses of getting infected with COVID-19. Providing training in health institutions may present an effective strategy in lowering problems.

TI  - Awareness of Saudi community toward multiple sclerosis in Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the awareness of Saudis in Qassim region, Saudi Arabia on multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 Saudis in Qassim, Saudi Arabia between January 2019 and June 2019 using a pre-designed questionnaire including socio-demographic data and questions evaluating knowledge about MS.
   Results: The majority of studied participants were adult females (74%), between 20-30 year-old (45.1%) and with high education level or above (80.6%). Nearly one third of the studied group had good knowledge regarding MS (31.7%). Half of the studied group knew that central nervous system (CNS) is the system affected by MS, 52% reported that vitamin D deficiency, family history of MS, personal history of autoimmune disease, viruses, and obesity are the factors which increase the risk of developing MS. Approximately, 62.9% knew that blurred and double vision, numbness, paralysis or weakness and difficulty in concentration and memorizing are symptoms of MS. Female participants and those knowing someone having MS had a significant good knowledge level regarding MS than others. Getting knowledge from combined sources from internet or social media; family, friends or neighbors and health workers was significantly more prevalent among those with good knowledge.
   Conclusion: Most of the study participants had limited knowledge regarding MS. Planning health education programs for the public is essential.

TI  - The Level of Awareness of Keratoconus Among the General Population in Hail Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - BackgroundKeratoconus (KC) is a non-inflammatory corneal disease with an early onset in adulthood, leading to a reduction in visual acuity. This study aims to evaluate the level of awareness of keratoconus among the general population in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia.MethodologyData were collected through a pre-designed and pre-validated online questionnaire (Appendix) distributed via social media platforms. The questionnaire was divided into two sections. The first section included demographic profiles, while the second section inquired about knowledge and awareness regarding Keratoconus. The collected data was reviewed, coded, and inputted into IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Statistical analyses were performed using the Pearson Chi-Square test, with statistical significance set at p<0.05.ResultsThe total number of respondents was 550, among whom 40% were males and 60% were females. 79.6% of the participants were in the age range of 18-30 years. The level of education and a positive family history of KC showed significant associations with the level of knowledge about KC (p<0.05). The age group had a non-significant association (p=0.059), while gender had a significant association with the level of knowledge about keratoconus (p<0.05).ConclusionIn conclusion, the overall awareness regarding KC progression, interventions, and the consequences of eye rubbing was limited among the participants. Specific efforts are crucial to enhance public awareness and understanding of KC, ensuring a more informed and proactive approach to eye health within the community.

TI  - Control of the 2018-2019 dengue fever outbreak in Oman: A country previously without local transmission
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: In December 2018, routine surveillance identified an autochthonous outbreak of dengue fever in Muscat Governorate, Oman, a region previously free of dengue fever.
   Methods: Routine surveillance confirmed locally acquired cases in the second week of December, leading to a rapid public health response including case management guidance and epidemiological investigations. The main activity was the vector survey using systematic sampling to assess extent of previously unreported Aedes aegypti presence followed by a campaign aimed to eliminate breeding sites of A. aegypti".
   Results: During a 5-month period, 343 suspected cases were reported from Muscat Governorate with 122 from the outbreak affected area. Out of 207 probable cases eligible for laboratory testing as per guidelines issued, 59 cases were confirmed. The vector elimination campaign started on January 8, 2019 after a media advocacy using television and social media and concluded on January 23. By the end of campaign, the case load had decreased significantly in the affected area with no reports of locally acquired cases from adjoining areas of Muscat Governorate, indicating no further spread.
   Conclusions: Rapid notification and early community-wide, extensive vector control activities effectively contained the autochthonous dengue fever virus outbreak. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - A Study of Older Adults' Mental Health across 33 Countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Despite older adults' extremely high vulnerability to COVID-19 complications and death, few studies have examined how personal characteristics and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the mental health of older adults at the global level. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among demographics, COVID-19 life impacts, and depression and anxiety in adults aged 60 and older from 33 countries. A sample of 823 older adults aged 60-94 and residing in 33 countries completed a 10-min online survey following recruitment from mailing lists and social media. Being separated from and having conflicts with loved ones predicted both anxiety and depression, as did residing in a country with higher income. Getting medical treatment for severe symptoms of COVID-19 and having decreased work responsibilities predicted depression, but adjustment to working from home and younger age predicted both depression and anxiety. Participants from Europe and Central Asia reported higher depression than those from all other regions and higher anxiety than those from Latin America and the Caribbean. The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious deleterious effects on the mental health of older adults worldwide. The current findings have direct implications for mental health services that may be delivered to older adults to help facilitate healthy psychological adjustment.

TI  - Parental awareness about non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and its side effects among their children in Qassim region
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (NSAIDs) are widely used for various conditions, mainly as an analgesics and anti-pyretics in adults as well as in pediatrics. Most of the users of NSAIDs aren't aware of the serious side effects of these medications. Aim: Estimation of parental awareness about NSIADs use and their side effects among their children in Qassim region. Materials and methods: The participants involved in the study are the parents whom have child/children aged 14 years old or younger. The population sample was selected randomly and they participated in the study with their own volition. The questionnaires were distributed through social media. Data analyses were done by using SPSS version 26. This study is cross-sectional study with a sample size of 516 conducted in Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Results: 516 were recruited (153 males and 363 females). The most common age group was from 36 to 55 years (47.9%). 84.5% have heard about NSAIDs. 77.1% used NSAIDs for their children below 14 years, but only 36.2% knew about NSAIDs side effects. Among the responders, 12.6% experienced NSAIDs side effects. The most commonly experienced side effect was allergy (50%) and gastroenterology problems (30%). The awareness toward NSAIDs use was more common among females. Conclusion: The parental awareness of NSAIDs use was within the adequate range. However, parent's knowledge of the potential side effects was low. Females with 2-5 children, were most likely to administer NSAIDs for their children below 14, contradictorily informed of NSAIDs and its indication of use, yet not aware about NSAIDs side effects.

TI  - EPOS2020: development strategy and goals for the latest European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis
T2  - RHINOLOGY
AB  - Background: The European Position Papers on Rhinosinusitis from 2005, 2007 and 2012 have had a measurable impact on the way this common condition with high impact on quality of life is managed around the world. EPOS2020 will be the latest iteration of the guideline, addressing new stakeholders and target users, presenting a summary of the latest literature and evolving treatment modalities, and formulating clear recommendations based on all available evidence.
   Methodology: Based on the AGREE II framework, this article demonstrates how the EPOS2020 steering group will address six key areas to ensure consistency in quality and presentation of information in the latest rhinosinusitis clinical practice guideline: scope and purpose; stakeholder involvement; rigour of development; clarity of presentation; recommendations and applicability; editorial independence.
   Results: By analysing the guidance from AGREE II, we formulated a detailed development strategy for EPOS2020. We identify new stakeholders and target users and ratify the importance of patient involvement in the latest EPOS guideline. New and expanded areas of research to be addressed are highlighted. We confirm our intention to use mixed methodologies, combining evidencebased medicine with real life studies; when no evidence can be found, use Delphi rounds to achieve clear, inclusive recommendations. We also introduce new concepts for dissemination of the guideline, using Internet and social media to improve accessibility.
   Conclusion: This article is an introduction to the EPOS2020 project, and presents the key goals, core stakeholders, planned methodology and dissemination strategies for the latest version of this influential guideline.

TI  - International multidisciplinary survey on the initial management of acute pancreatitis: Perspective of point-of-care specialists focused on daily practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEPATO-BILIARY-PANCREATIC SCIENCES
AB  - Background The initial management of patients with acute pancreatitis impacts both morbidity and mortality. Point-of-care decisions have been reported to differ from clinical guideline recommendations. Methods An online anonymous questionnaire was distributed through scientific associations and social media using REDCap. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the characteristics of participants associated with compliance with the recommendations. Results A total of 1054 participants from 94 countries completed the questionnaire; median age (IQR) was 39 (32-47) years; 30.7% were women. Among the participants, 37% opted for nonmoderate flow of i.v. fluid, 31% for fluid type other than Ringer's lactate; 73.4% were in favor of nil per os to patients who could eat, 75.5% for other than enteral feeding to patients with oral intolerance; 15.5% used prophylactic antibiotic in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, 34.1% in necrotizing acute pancreatitis, and 27.4% in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome; 27.8% delayed cholecystectomy after biliary acute pancreatitis. Participants with publications in PubMed on acute pancreatitis showed better compliance (OR, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.15-2.32; P = .007) with recommendations of the clinical guidelines. Conclusions Feeding and nutrition require the greatest improvement efforts, but also the use of prophylactic antibiotics and timing of cholecystectomy should be improved.

TI  - Awareness Level of General Population Regarding Club Foot in Aseer Region, Southern of Saudi Arabia
T2  - WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Club foot, is a congenital structural deformity characterized by hindfoot equines, midfoot cavus, and forefoot adduction. It is the most common musculoskeletal birth defect worldwide with males being more affected than females. Without treatment, clubfoot may lead to lifelong disability. Population awareness regarding clubfoot has a significant role in early diagnosis and management of the disorder.
   Aim: to assess the general population awareness regarding club foot in Aseer region, southern Saudi Arabia.
   Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all population in Aseer region. The study was conducted during the period from December 2019 to April 2020, Data were collected using structured questionnaire which included person's socio-demographic data, and participants' awareness regarding club foot, The questionnaire was uploaded online using social media platforms. Results: A total of 744 participants were included in the survey from the general population in Aseer region. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old and males were 375 (51.2%). As for club foot risk factors, 314 (42.2%) participants reported genetic factors followed by Fetal malpresentation (222; 29.8%), neurological disorders (124; 16.7%), and twin pregnancy (69;9.3%). Totally, good awareness level was recorded among a very low percentage of the surveyed population.
   Conclusions & recommendations: In conclusion, the survey revealed that public awareness regarding club foot in Aseer region was very low especially among females with a high level of education. Health care providers had no role in improving this public awareness.

TI  - Multistate outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium linked to pet hedgehogs, United States, 2018-2019
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - In December 2018, PulseNet, the national laboratory network for enteric disease surveillance, identified an increase in Salmonella Typhimurium isolates with an uncommon pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern which was previously isolated from hedgehogs. CDC, state, and local health partners interviewed patients with a questionnaire that focused on hedgehog exposures, conducted traceback of patients' hedgehog purchases, and collected hedgehog faecal pellets and environmental samples. Isolates in this outbreak were analysed using core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) and compared to sequence data from historic clinical isolates from a 2011-2013 outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses linked to pet hedgehogs. Fifty-four illnesses in 23 states were identified between October 2018 and September 2019. Patients ranged from <1 to 95 years, and 65% were female. Eight patients were hospitalized. Eighty-one per cent (29/36) of patients interviewed reported contact with a hedgehog before becoming ill; of these, 21 (72%) reported owning a hedgehog. Analysis of 53 clinical, 11 hedgehog, and two hedgehog bedding isolates from this outbreak, seven hedgehog isolates obtained prior to this outbreak, and two clinical isolates from the 2011-2013 outbreak fell into three distinct groupings (37 isolates in Clade 1 [0-10 alleles], 28 isolates in Clade 2 [0-7 alleles], and eight isolates in Clade 3 [0-12 alleles]) and were collectively related within 0-31 alleles by cgMLST. Purchase information available from 20 patients showed hedgehogs were purchased from multiple breeders across nine states, a pet store, and through an online social media website; a single source of hedgehogs was not identified. This outbreak highlights the ability of genetic sequencing analysis to link historic and ongoing Salmonella illness outbreaks and demonstrates the strain of Salmonella linked to hedgehogs might continue to be a health risk to hedgehog owners unless measures are taken to prevent transmission.

TI  - Weekly updates of national living evidence-based guidelines: methods for the Australian living guidelines for care of people with COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background and Objectives: The Australian National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce is a consortium of 31 Australian health professional organisations developing living, evidence-based guidelines for care of people with COVID-19, which are updated weekly. This article describes the methods used to develop and maintain the guidelines.
   Methods: The guidelines use the GRADE methods and are designed to meet Australian NHMRC standards. Each week, new evidence is reviewed, current recommendations are revised, and new recommendations made. These are published in MAGIC and disseminated through traditional and social media. Relevant new questions to be addressed are continually sought from stakeholders and practitioners. For prioritized questions, the evidence is actively monitored and updated. Evidence surveillance combines horizon scans and targeted searches. An evidence team appraises and synthesizes evidence and prepares evidence-to-decision frameworks to inform development of recommendations. A guidelines leadership group oversees the development of recommendations by multidisciplinary guidelines panels and is advised by a consumer panel.
   Results: : The Taskforce formed in March 2020, and the first recommendations were published 2 weeks later. The guidelines have been revised and republished on a weekly basis for 24 weeks, and as of October 2020, contain over 90 treatment recommendations, suggesting that living methods are feasible in this context.
   Conclusions: The Australian guidelines for care of people with COVID-19 provide an example of the feasibility of living guidelines and an opportunity to test and improve living evidence methods. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Knowledge of healthcare providers in the management of anaphylaxis
T2  - WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction: Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Early diagnosis and treatment of a severe allergic reaction requires recognition of the signs and symptoms, as well as classification of severity. It is a clinical emergency, and healthcare providers should have the knowledge for recognition and management. The aim of the study is to evaluate the level of knowledge in the management of anaphylaxis in healthcare providers.
   Methods: It is an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare providers over 18 years old via a Google Forms link and shared through different social media platforms. A 12-item questionnaire was applied which included the evaluation of the management of anaphylaxis, from June 2020 to May 2021.
   Results: A total of 1023 surveys were evaluated; 1013 met inclusion criteria and were included in the statistical analysis. A passing grade was considered with 8 or more correct answers out of 12; the overall approval percentage was 28.7%. The group with the highest percentage of approval in the questionnaire was health-care providers with more than 30 years of work experience. There was a significant difference between the proportions of approval between all specialty groups, and in a post-hoc analysis, allergy and immunology specialists showed greater proportions of approval compared to general medicine practitioners (62.9% vs 25%; p=<0.001).
   Conclusions: It is important that healthcare providers know how to recognize, diagnose, and treat anaphylaxis, and later refer them to specialists in Allergy and Clinical Immunology in order to make a personalized diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - A cross-sectional survey of non-specialist Australian audio-vestibular clinical practice for traumatic brain injury and rehabilitation
T2  - BRAIN IMPAIRMENT
AB  - Objective:This study explored non-specialist audiological clinical practice in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and whether such practices incorporated considerations of TBI-related complexities pertaining to identification, diagnosis and management of associated auditory and vestibular disturbances. Design:A cross-sectional online survey exploring clinical practice, TBI-related training and information provision was distributed to audiologists across Australia via Audiology Australia and social media. Fifty audiologists, 80% female and 20% male, participated in this study. Years of professional practice ranged from new graduate to more than 20 years of experience. Results:Clear gaps of accuracy in knowledge and practice across all survey domains relating to the identification, diagnosis and management of patients with auditory and/or vestibular deficits following TBI were evident. Further, of the surveyed audiologists working in auditory and vestibular settings, 91% and 86%, respectively, reported not receiving professional development for the diagnosis and management of post-traumatic audio-vestibular deficits. Conclusion:Inadequate resources, equipment availability and TBI-related training may have contributed to the gaps in service provision, influencing audiological management of patients with TBI. A tailored TBI approach to identification, diagnosis and management of post-traumatic auditory and vestibular disturbances is needed.

TI  - Tele-entomology and tele-parasitology: A citizen science-based approach for surveillance and control of Chagas disease in Venezuela
T2  - PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL
AB  - Chagas Disease (CD), a chronic infection caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, is a Neglected Tropical Disease endemic to Latin America. With a re-emergence in Venezuela during the past two decades, the spread of CD has proved susceptible to, and inhibitable by a digital, real-time sur-veillance system effectuated by Citizen Scientists in communities throughout the country. The #TraeTuChipo (#BringYourKissingBug) campaign implemented in January 2020, has served as such a strategy counting on community engagement to define the current ecological distribution of CD vectors despite the absence of a functional national surveillance program. This pilot campaign collected data through online surveys, social media platforms, and/or telephone text messages. A total of 79 triatomine bugs were reported from eighteen Venezuelan states; 67 bugs were identified as Panstrongylus geniculatus, 1 as Rhodnius pictipes, 1 as Triatoma dimidiata, and 10 as Triatoma maculata. We analyzed 8 triatomine feces samples spotted from 4 Panstrongylus geniculatus which were confirmed positive by qPCR for T. cruzi. Further molecular characteriza-tion of discrete typing units (DTUs), revealed that all samples contained TcI, the most highly diverse and broadly distributed strain of T. cruzi. Moreover, analysis of the mitochondrial 12S gene revealed Myotis keaysi, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus as the main triatomine feeding sources. This study highlights a novel Citizen Science approach which may help improve the surveillance systems for CD in endemic countries.

TI  - Menstruation in the USA
T2  - CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewMenstruation touches all spheres of human society, including psychology, education, business, policy, race, and religion. This narrative review aims to describe the relationship menstruation holds with these spaces.Recent FindingsFirst, menstruation plays many roles in psychology - premenstrual syndrome affects psychological well-being, and in turn, psychological stress impacts menstruation. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea can result when stress hormones inhibit the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis. Furthermore, menstruation has many implications for all aged individuals, especially adolescents and those who are menopausal. These implications underscore the importance of proper education surrounding menstruation, which can be achieved via social media, school systems, family, and clinicians. However, menstrual health education is highly variable depending on the state and family that someone is raised in. Additionally, menstruation can pose a financial burden as menstrual products can be expensive and access to these products is limited for those who are homeless, incarcerated, and low-income. Recent public policy measures in various states have aimed to achieve "menstrual equity," by requiring public schools to supply free menstrual products in bathrooms. Furthermore, racial disparities exist with menstrual disorders. Uterine fibroids occur more frequently in Black menstruators compared to White menstruators, and Black women experience worse outcomes overall with fibroids and endometriosis management. Finally, analysis of religion and its relationship to menstruation underscores the immense stigma and "impurity" associated with menstruation.SummaryOverall, this review highlights the universality of menstruation in society. As a "fifth vital sign," there is significant room for improvement in terms of education, research, and cultural acceptance of menstruation. Future research should explore interventions to reduce these gaps.

TI  - Considerations of Racism and Data Equity Among Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, And Pacific Islanders in the Context of COVID-19
T2  - CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the importance of considering social determinants of health, including factors such as structural racism. This review discusses some of the evidence that triangulates on this issue, including data from hate crime statistics, social media analysis, and survey-based research. It also examines the data needs for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities. Recent Findings The available data provides evidence that the pandemic has contributed to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment and discriminatory incidents. Many reports have surfaced showing a surge in anti-Chinese discrimination, which has "spilled over" into other Asian communities. Research is beginning to emerge to show that such discrimination may also impact health issues such as psychological distress. Given prior research, we would expect many more studies to emerge in the future. Also, the pandemic has illustrated the major gaps in data available to disentangle the health and social concerns facing Asian Americans and NHPI communities. Significant issues include the lack of systematic reporting of data for these communities both across states, and even among agencies within a state; erroneous aggregation of Asians with NHPIs; and censoring of data. These gaps and issues contribute to bias that obscures objective data and amplifies health inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the well-being of Asian American and NHPI communities. It is critical to provide disaggregated data, not only so that we can have accurate reporting, but also to ensure data and health equity.

TI  - How should electronic health records be designed? A cross-sectional study in patients with psoriasis
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB  - Background Electronic health records (EHRs) are promising tools for routine care. These applications might not only enhance the interaction between patient and physician but also support therapy management. This is crucial in complex and chronic conditions like psoriasis. However, EHRs can only unfold their full potential when being accepted by the users. Therefore, this study aims to analyse how EHRs should be designed for patients with psoriasis and to identify differences between patient subgroups. Methods We developed a questionnaire on the acceptability of EHRs based on literature research and results from focus groups. Participants completed a paper-based or electronic version of the questionnaire. We recruited participants at an outpatient clinic as well as online via patient associations and a social media platform. We analysed data using descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses applying Chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Results The sample encompassed 187 patients with psoriasis. Data reveals that 84.4% of the participants can think of entering data into an EHR. Participants prefer entering data at home (72.2%) instead of entering data in the waiting room (44.9%) and using an own internet-ready device (laptop/computer: 62.6%; smartphone/tablet: 61.5%) instead of a provided device (46.0%). Altogether, 55.6% of participants would accept entering data on a monthly basis when this lasts between one and 10 minutes and further 27.8% would accept even longer lasting data entry. Data privacy is of great concern (e.g. patient should decide who has access to data: 96.7%). Subgroup analyses reveal differences with regard to age, educational level, burden due to psoriasis, number of internet activities, use of electronic questionnaires and mode of administration. Conclusion The high acceptance of entering data is favourable for the implementation of EHRs. The results suggest technical and structural recommendations: Differences between subgroups support the development of flexible EHRs encompassing a basic module, which is expandable with further add-ons, and compatible to different devices. Furthermore, involving patients by entering data into an EHR requires that physicians communicate open-mindedly with the patient and consider data throughout decision-making. Patients should remain owner of their own health data and decide about its processing.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - (1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific production, collaboration among countries, and research topics focusing on pediatric obesity. (2) Methods: The papers that were included in the study were retrieved from theWeb of Science Core Collection from Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis of several focuses, including journals of publication, subject categories, most frequent author keywords, and journal impact factors, was conducted. Social network analysis was used to recognize collaboration groups between countries and the co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A total of 12,171 research articles were published in 2036 journals classified under a variety of subject areas, with pediatrics (27.7%), nutrition and dietetics (18.5%), and public environmental and occupational health (18.4%) accounting for the most frequent study areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity (299), and BMC Public Health being the most productive journals. The main challenges identified for pediatric obesity include general topics such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4) Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number of published articles of 59.8%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics along with specialized health terms and terms related to public health.

TI  - Tinea Unguium and Tinea Pedis and Their Correlation With Diabetes Mellitus in the General Population in the Hail Region, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background Tinea pedis or foot ringworm is an infection of the feet affecting the soles, interdigital clefts of toes, and nails, with a dermatophyte fungus. It is also called athlete's foot. Onychomycosis of the nail is caused by dermatophytes called Tinea unguium. An abnormal nail not caused by a fungal infection is a type of dystrophic nail. Onychomycosis can infect both fingernails and toenails, but onychomycosis of the toenail is much more prevalent. Aim The study aimed to assess the knowledge, perception, and awareness among a sample from Ha'il City, Saudi Arabia, of the definitions, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, complications, and treatment of both Tinea pedis and Tinea unguium, along with their correlation with diabetic patients. Material A cross-sectional survey was distributed throughout Ha'il City. An online questionnaire was designed and distributed via various social media apps, which included questions concerning participants' sociodemographic information, alongside questions regarding the risk factors, signs, symptoms, complications, and management of both Tinea pedis and Tinea unguium. Methods SPSS for Windows v22.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) was used for statistical analysis. Results The overall awareness of the study's participants about Tinea Pedis and Tinea unguium infection was low (34.82%).

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Background:Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in numerous experimental studies, particularly in skin cancer diagnostics. Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods:A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results:298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91-0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85-0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35-0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92-0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions:The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system.

TI  - A Data Visualization and Dissemination Resource to Support HIV Prevention and Care at the Local Level: Analysis and Uses of the AIDSVu Public Data Resource
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: AIDSVu is a public resource for visualizing HIV surveillance data and other population-based information relevant to HIV prevention, care, policy, and impact assessment.
   Objective: The site, AIDSVu.org, aims to make data about the US HIV epidemic widely available, easily accessible, and locally relevant to inform public health decision making.
   Methods: AIDSVu develops visualizations, maps, and downloadable datasets using results from HIV surveillance systems, other population-based sources of information (eg, US Census and national probability surveys), and other data developed specifically for display and dissemination through the website (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] prescriptions). Other types of content are developed to translate surveillance data into summarized content for diverse audiences using infographic panels, interactive maps, local and state fact sheets, and narrative blog posts.
   Results: Over 10 years, AIDSVu.org has used an expanded number of data sources and has progressively provided HIV surveillance and related data at finer geographic levels, with current data resources providing HIV prevalence data down to the census tract level in many of the largest US cities. Data are available at the county level in 48 US states and at the ZIP Code level in more than 50 US cities. In 2019, over 500,000 unique users consumed AIDSVu data and resources, and HIV-related data and insights were disseminated through nearly 4,000,000 social media posts. Since AIDSVu's inception, at least 249 peer-reviewed publications have used AIDSVu data for analyses or referenced AIDSVu resources. Data uses have included targeting of HIV testing programs, identifying areas with inequitable PrEP uptake, including maps and data in academic and community grant applications, and strategically selecting locations for new HIV treatment and care facilities to serve high-need areas.
   Conclusions: Surveillance data should be actively used to guide and evaluate public health programs; AIDSVu translates high-quality, population-based data about the US HIV epidemic and makes that information available in formats that are not consistently available in surveillance reports. Bringing public health surveillance data to an online resource is a democratization of data, and presenting information about the HIV epidemic in more visual formats allows diverse stakeholders to engage with, understand, and use these important public health data to inform public health decision making.

TI  - Shared associations between histories of victimisation among people with eating disorder symptoms and higher weight
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The success of integrated prevention initiatives for eating disorders and obesity is hampered by a lack of shared risk factor research. Bullying and sexual abuse are potentially potent shared risk factors for the spectrum of eating and weight disorders. Methods: A representative sample of N = 3005 South Australian males and females >= 15 years was interviewed about their height, weight, eating disorder symptoms, lifetime experiences of bullying and sexual abuse and mental and physical health-related quality of life. Results: Participants who were currently obese (25.2%) or underweight (2.7%) or who reported current eating disorder symptoms (32.7%) were between 10% and 27% more likely to have experienced bullying, and obese and eating disordered participants were also 47% and 56% more likely to have experienced sexual abuse, respectively. In regard to specific symptoms, a lifetime history of bullying was associated with increased risk of obesity, extreme dieting, purging and overvaluation of body weight and/or shape, whereas a lifetime history of sexual abuse was associated with increased risk of obesity, binge eating and extreme dieting and decreased risk of underweight. Lifetime histories of bullying and sexual abuse were associated with health-related quality of life impairment; however, lifetime bullying was associated with a greater adverse impact among participants with current eating disorder symptoms. Conclusion: Self-reported bullying and sexual abuse victimisation have shared associations with eating and weight spectrum problems. Differences in the symptoms associated with bullying versus sexual abuse are discussed, as well as the clinical and public health implications.

TI  - Maternal vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 immunisation of children in Qatar: a population-based cross-sectional study
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted in Qatar to explore beliefs and attitudes among mothers towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination for their children and to understand major factors influencing vaccine hesitancy among these mothers.METHODS: A population-based, online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 15 October and 15 November 2020. A composite questionnaire incorporating a validated vaccine hesitancy tool was developed and administered in both English and Arabic. Approval was obtained from the local ethics committee. Participation was voluntary and offered to all adult residents of Qatar through an online link available on social media platforms and local news portals. Only adult respondents who self -iden-tified as mothers were included in the present study. No personal identifying data were collected.RESULTS: Of the mothers surveyed, 29.4% exhibited COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy regarding their children. This exceeded these mothers' rate of personal vaccine hesitancy (27.5%). Hesitancy rates varied significantly with ethnicity, with the highest among Qatari mothers (51.3%). Intention to vaccinate children did not differ significantly between mothers who accepted the vaccine for themselves and those who did not. Overall, the main reported concerns related to long-term vaccine safety. To a sig-nificant extent, mothers relied most on self-directed research on vaccine safety for decision-making.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of maternal COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy exceeded both those mothers' rate of personal vaccine hesitancy and the hesitancy rate in the general population. The intention to vaccinate children was independent of maternal vaccination history. Factors influencing maternal vaccine hesitancy differ from those influencing personal hesitancy and re-quire an informed public health response.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students in India
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was launched in India on 16 January 2021, prioritising health care workers which included medical students. We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February to 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers. Prior adult vaccination did not have an effect on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted awareness campaigns, regulatory oversight of vaccine trials and public release of safety and efficacy data and trust building activities could further reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students.

TI  - The Prevalence and Level of Awareness of Medication Overuse Headache in Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache caused by regular overuse of medication(s) intended to relieve (notably, not prevent) the symptoms of a pre-existing primary headache (most commonly, migraine and tension headaches). MOH places a considerable burden on both patients and society. Understandably, the disorder is the subject of many cross-sectional studies worldwide. Research on MOH in Qassim province, Saudi Arabia, however, has not been conducted; therefore, the present study aims to identify the prevalence and level of awareness of MOH in Qassim province.Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in Qassim province from July 1, 2021, to June 13, 2022. A modified electronic questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms. The questionnaire covers demographics, prevalence of MOH, and awareness of MOH. Prevalence was measured using a scoring system based on the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition (ICHD-3) for diagnosing MOH.Results A total of 499 people completed the questionnaire, 286 (57.3%) of whom were female and 213 (42.7%) of whom were male. The majority of the participants were Saudi nationals (95.4%). The mean age of the participants was 35 years old (+/- 12.7 years). Out of the 499 participants, 451 (90.4%) reported that they had experienced headaches in their life. The prevalence of MOH among those who had reported headaches was 4%, compared with a level of awareness of MOH among all the participants of 18%. Conclusion According to our study, there is a high prevalence of MOH in Qassim province. This is also coupled with a high awareness of MOH.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude and practice among mothers toward home head trauma management in Riyadh, 2020-2021 : A cross sectional study
T2  - WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Head trauma is one of the major home accidents among children worldwide and could lead to long-life disabilities or death in severe cases. The worldwide incidence of pediatric traumatic brain injury ranges between 47 and 280 per 100,000 children. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward head trauma among mothers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This study aims to assess the mother's knowledge, reaction, and immediate action toward head trauma of children under five years in Riyadh city, 2020-2021.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was developed locally in Cluster one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study included 390 mothers who met the inclusion criteria. Data was collected by MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 26.
   Results: In this study, we collected data from 390 mothers of children under five years old who responded to our distributed questionnaire. Most of the participants were between 31-40 years old (40 %), while 31.5 % were between 20-30 years old. Considering the source of knowledge of mothers toward home accidents, we found that 6 % did not know about home accidents, while 45 % took their knowledge from social media, and 14.9 % from school books. Furthermore, we found that 71.28 % of the mothers strongly agreed about the importance of attending courses on head trauma.
   Conclusion: We found that the level of knowledge among mothers in Al Riyadh region toward managing head trauma and preventing home injuries among children is sub-adequate. Many factors affect this knowledge, including maternal education, monthly income and occupation, and attending first aid training.

TI  - Australian community pharmacists' ability to identify the indications for dental prescriptions-a case vignette study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE
AB  - Objectives Pharmacists are known as medicine experts. Dentists can independently prescribe and administer medications related to dental conditions such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories and analgesics. However, little is known about pharmacists' knowledge and perceptions of medicines prescribed for dentistry. Therefore, this study aimed to assess community pharmacists' ability to identify the indications for dental prescriptions using hypothetical vignettes. Methods Australian community pharmacists were invited through email and social media to undertake a web-based questionnaire consisting of nine case vignettes of dental prescriptions and their indicated uses in dental settings and two perception-based questions. The results were provided as a percentage of the correct answers to the case vignettes. In addition, Pearson chi-square tests were performed to examine associations between categorical variables. Key findings Of the 202 pharmacists who completed the questionnaire, the mean number of correct responses was 5 +/- 2 (out of 9). More than three-quarters (78.5%) of pharmacists believed that thorough knowledge of prescriptions for dental ailments was necessary for safe and effective community pharmacy practice. In addition, nearly two-thirds (64.1%) felt confident that they could dispense medicines indicated for dental conditions safely and effectively. Conclusions The knowledge demonstrated by participants through correct identification of the indications for dental prescription was less than optimal. Professional development courses for pharmacists in dental ailments could prove beneficial.

TI  - COVID-19: Journey so far and Deep Insight Using Crowdsourced Data in India
T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
AB  - The aim of this study is to assemble the data and reflect the epidemiological statistics required as well as apply mathematical prototypical approach of the new outbreak that cover all perspectives of the facts and figures as of August 08, 2020, and thereby suggest the direction of the forthcoming epidemic situation in India for all policy makers. The outburst of the new fatal strain of coronavirus from an animal-to-human fall over in China has infected at least 204 countries as well as territories throughout the world. As of April 03, 2020, almost 972,303 confirmed cases and 50,321 deaths have been reported across the world due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that attained a huge elevation to 19.3 x 10(6) confirmed cases on August 08, 2020, of which India contributes a major part of 2.09 x 10(6) confirmed cases. It is the first neoliberal virus that easily encompasses its danger chiefly to easily susceptible including the malnutrition, the ill, and old people. As the world struggles with pandemic, India with its second largest population of more than 1.3 billion people in the world is likely to have many more cases than the numbers currently being reported. This has put numerous thousand individuals under observation in the country due to clinical symptoms, recent travel to China, Italy, Iran, and concordant entries in the relevant tailing surveys. The novelty of this approach is to rely on the exclusive source of official data, for social media and daily tracking of news reports in India that collected and curated the pertinent information.

TI  - Regional transmission patterns of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales: A healthcare network analysis
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a serious public health threat and spread rapidly between healthcare facilities (HCFs) during interfacility patient movement. We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was applied to test the association between network measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters, yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3% (95% CI, 2%-4%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are warranted.

TI  - Social support network and continuity of care: an ego-network study of psychiatric service users
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose For severely mentally ill (SMI) users, continuity of care requires consistency between the supports provided by the members of their social support network. However, we know little about their network cohesion and its association with continuity of care. We set out to investigate this association and hypothesised that it would depend on the severity of the user's situation and on his/her living arrangements.
   Methods We conducted face-to-face interviews with 380 SMI users recruited in outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three areas in Belgium. Data regarding users' social networks were collected using an ego-network mapping technique and analysed with social network analysis. The cohesion indicators were density (frequency of connections between network members), centralisation (having a small number of central people), and egobetweenness (the user's centrality in his/her own network). Participants' perception of continuity of care was measured by the Alberta Continuity of Services Scale.
   Results Results show that cohesion indicators were associated with continuity of care only for users with high-severity problems, regardless of their living arrangements. The numbers of network members, professionals, and services in the network were all negatively associated with continuity of care for all the users.
   Conclusions Satisfactory continuity of care requires fewer professionals or services in a user's network and a dense network for users with the most severe problems. This implies that those providing care must not only be able to increase cohesion within a network, but also to adapt their interventions to support the transition to a different, individualised network structure when severity decreases.

TI  - Superusers' Engagement in Asthma Online Communities: Asynchronous Web-Based Interview Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Superusers, defined as the 1% of users who write a large number of posts, play critical roles in online health communities (OHCs), catalyzing engagement and influencing other users' self-care. Their unique online behavior is key to sustaining activity in OHCs and making them flourish. Our previous work showed the presence of 20 to 30 superusers active on a weekly basis among 3345 users in the nationwide Asthma UK OHC and that the community would disintegrate if superusers were removed. Recruiting these highly skilled individuals for research purposes can be challenging, and little is known about supemsers.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore superusers' motivation to actively engage in OHCs, the difficulties they may face, and their interactions with health care professionals (HCPs).
   Methods: An asynchronous web-based structured interview study was conducted. Superusers of the Asthma UK OHC and Facebook groups were recruited through Asthma UK staff to pilot and subsequently complete the questionnaire Open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: There were 17 superusers recruited for the study (14 patients with asthma and 3 carers); the majority were female (15/17). The age range of participants was 18 to 75 years. They were active in OHCs for 1 to 6 years and spent between 1 and 20 hours per week reading and 1 and 3 hours per week writing posts. Superusers' participation in OHCs was prompted by curiosity about asthma and its medical treatment and by the availability of spare time when they were off work due to asthma exacerbations or retired. Their engagement increased over time as participants furthered their familiarity with the OHCs and their knowledge of asthma and its self-management. Financial or social recognition of the superuser role was not important; their reward came from helping and interacting with others. According to the replies provided, they showed careful judgment to distinguish what can be dealt with through peer advice and what needs input from HCPs. Difficulties were encountered when dealing with misunderstandings about asthma and its treatment, patients not seeking advice from HCPs when needed, and miracle cures or dangerous ideas. Out of 17 participants, only 3 stated that their HCPs were aware of their engagement with OHCs. All superusers thought that HCPs should direct patients to OHCs, provided they are trusted and moderated. In addition, 9 users felt that HCPs themselves should take part in OHCs.
   Conclusions: Superusers from a UK-wide online community are highly motivated, altruistic, and mostly female individuals who exhibit judgment about the complexity of coping with asthma and the limits of their advice. Engagement with OHCs satisfies their psychosocial needs. Future research should explore how to address their unmet needs, their interactions with HCPs, and the potential integration of OHCs in traditional healthcare.

TI  - The Level of School Teachers? Knowledge About First-Aid Management and Control of Epistaxis in Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Epistaxis is an acute episode of nasal bleeding commonly caused in children by traumatic injuries in a school setting. It is one of the common ear, nose, and throat emergencies, which should be managed with first-aid measures. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted among school teachers in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia regarding this information. This study thus aimed to assess levels of knowledge about first-aid management and control of epistaxis among school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia.Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study using a validated online questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms. Information was collected regarding sociodemographic characteristics, and eight items assessed participants' knowledge about epistaxis and its management. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess the factors associated with good levels of knowledge.Results: The study had a total of 1,152 participants, of which 69.7% were female. The mean of knowledge was 3.29 (SD=1.39, range: 0-7). Only 19.4% of participants had a good level of knowledge. In multivariate analysis, females and those who had received information on first aid to stop nose-bleeds were significantly associated with good knowledge levels (adjusted odds ratio {AOR}: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.18-2.51, p=0.005; and AOR: 3.38, 95% CI: 2.47-4.64, p<0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Less than one-quarter of participants had good knowledge levels. Health education sessions for teachers are highly recommended and should specifically target male teachers.

TI  - Pulse article: survey of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients around the world
T2  - SPINAL CORD SERIES AND CASES
AB  - Study design Online survey distributed to healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in care of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). Objectives Identify and bring awareness to the variation of neurogenic bladder management in around the world. Setting International online questionnaire. Methods A 32-question survey was drafted and circulated among a global network of SCI experts for review. The survey was disseminated to healthcare professionals involved in the care of NLUTD in SCI patients via social media, grassroots methods, and international societies. The survey was available for 6 weeks and respondents answered questions regarding SCI population demographics, access to care, common neurogenic bladder management, diagnostic and imaging methods, complications, and follow up. Results A total of 296 healthcare professionals, 132 from North America, 87 from Europe, 27 from Asia, 24 from Australia, 14 from South America, and 6 from Africa, responded to the survey. Global concurrence was noted among management method for patients without adequate hand function, first-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity, and common complications. Continents highly differed in responses regarding management method for patients with adequate hand function, frequency of patients reusing catheters, timing of urodynamics, and duration of antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections. Conclusions The results of this international survey demonstrate the variability and uniqueness in neurogenic bladder management in SCI patients around the world. Increased international discourse and education will improve global communication and transparency with the efforts of reducing discrepancies in care.

TI  - Observational Study of Self-Reported Offshore Sailing-Related Injuries in a Wide Range of Amateur and Professional Sailors
T2  - WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction-Offshore sailing yields injury risk. Unfortunately, many studies are restricted to a specific geographic location, regatta, or class of sailboat or to only professional sailors. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to gather a large database of sailing-related injuries with demographic, injury, and voyage characteristics. Methods-An observational study of self-reported offshore sailing-related injuries was performed using an internet-based, multiple-choice survey distributed on social media. Data were analyzed statistically with the use of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi 2 test. Results-Five hundred sixty-eight people completed the survey, 217 women and 351 men, with a mean age of 36.26 y (SD=13.69 y). Among reported 793 cruises, 141 resulted in injury (18%). The most frequent injury types were contusion (40%) and skin lesions and lacerations (20%); the most frequent locations were hand (28%) and foot and ankle (18%), and the most frequent mechanisms were tripping/falling (33%), being hit by an object (19%), and using ropes (19%). Sex, age, and sailing experience were not injury risk factors, while higher number of offshore days was (P=0.0004). None of the analyzed voyage characteristics (purpose, ship's class, position on the ship, ship's length overall, type of rigging, and harness wearing) were injury risk factors. Sailors perceived the following as risk factors: inattention/distraction (34%), difficult weather conditions (22%), and fatigue/lack of sleep (14%). Conclusions-Approximately 1 in 5 cruises resulted in an injury, occurring regardless of demographic, injury, and voyage characteristics. The multifactorial nature of injuries poses a challenge in implementing safety measures. The authors hope that this study may aid in that cause.

TI  - Dietary management of type 2 diabetes mellitus among South Asian immigrants: A mixed-methods study
T2  - NUTRITION & DIETETICS
AB  - AimsThere is a high prevalence of South Asian immigrants in Australia living with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the dietary management of the condition presenting as a key challenge. However, their current dietary patterns and barriers to diabetes self-management are unclear. Therefore, this study aims to (i) investigate current dietary patterns and (ii) explore barriers and facilitators to dietary management in this population.MethodsA concurrent mixed-methods study comprising three 24-h dietary recalls and a semi-structured interview for each self-identified South Asian immigrant adult with diabetes recruited across Victorian primary care clinics and social media to address the aforementioned two aims. Dietary recall data were converted into food groups using Foodworks, and data analysed in SPSS. Qualitative data were thematically analysed using NVivo.ResultsAmong 18 participants recruited, 14, 16 and 17 participants had grain, fruit and dairy intake lower than daily Australian recommendations, respectively. These findings echoed qualitative data that participants viewed diabetes management as reducing carbohydrate intake. Participants reported difficulties incorporating diabetes-related dietary and lifestyle recommendations into their routine and a lack of knowledge about available organisational support. They mentioned challenges in receiving social support from families and friends and relied on support from health professionals. Facilitators included proficiency in nutrition information label reading and self-blood glucose monitoring skills.ConclusionEnhancing the accessibility to organisational support, facilitating the adaption of dietary recommendations into individuals' routines, and strengthening support from health professionals are essential components in intervention development to improve diabetes management for South Asians.

TI  - Analysis of mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums: a natural language processing study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users. Setting and design We obtained data from three leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19. Primary outcome measures (1) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords; (2) proportion of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19; (3) proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to physical and mental health comorbidities. Results Data from 739 434 posts created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A total of 35 581 posts (4.8%) contained a COVID-19 keyword. Posts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early March to mid-March around the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users to post on online health forums for the first time. Over a quarter of COVID-19-related thread titles mentioned a physical or mental health comorbidity. Conclusions We demonstrate that it is feasible to characterise the content of online health forum user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. The pandemic and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on posters' queries regarding mental health. Social media data sources such as online health forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health surveillance.

TI  - The obesity wars and the education of a researcher: A personal account
T2  - PROGRESS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
AB  - A naive researcher published a scientific article in a respectable journal. She thought her article was straightforward and defensible. It used only publicly available data, and her findings were consistent with much of the literature on the topic. Her coauthors included two distinguished statisticians. To her surprise her publication was met with unusual attacks from some unexpected sources within the research community. These attacks were by and large not pursued through normal channels of scientific discussion. Her research became the target of an aggressive campaign that included insults, errors, misinformation, social media posts, behind-the-scenes gossip and maneuvers, and complaints to her employer. The goal appeared to be to undermine and discredit her work. The controversy was something deliberately manufactured, and the attacks primarily consisted of repeated assertions of preconceived opinions. She learned first-hand the antagonism that could be provoked by inconvenient scientific findings. Guidelines and recommendations should be based on objective and unbiased data. Development of public health policy and clinical recommendations is complex and needs to be evidence-based rather than belief-based. This can be challenging when a hot-button topic is involved.

TI  - Assessing the Perceptions and Practices Toward Eye Injuries First Aid Among General Population in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Aim The eye is a vital and extraordinarily perceptive part of the human body. A wide spectrum of possible outcomes from eye injuries, from temporary vision loss to permanent blindness. There is a lack of information about how to handle an eye injury. Education and raising awareness are the best way to prevent severe complications and eventual loss of vision. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and assess general population knowledge and first aid practices regarding eye injuries in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia, focusing on the importance of early management. Methodology A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered among residents of western Saudi Arabia using a validated questionnaire. One thousand two hundred seventy-nine adults of both genders were randomly chosen to represent the sample. In December 2022, we used a web-based survey to gather our data. Result This study analyzed data from 1279 responses on the online platform. Results showed that good knowledge was significantly higher among females than males, those without a history of eye injury than their peers with injuries, and those with higher educational levels than those with lower educational levels. Additionally, good knowledge was predicted by the female gender (OR = 1.6, 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.1, p < 0.001). Conclusion The study found that public awareness of eye injury first aid was good in the western region. The role of physicians should be expanded and health education campaigns and social media are recommended to achieve the goal of reduction and limiting the most crucial damage to the most sensitive organ in the body.

TI  - Frequency and impact of musculoskeletal symptoms on quality of life in MEN2B
T2  - CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Objective To investigate the impact of musculoskeletal (MSK)-related symptoms on the quality of life of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 2b (MEN2B). Design An online survey was distributed by the Association for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Disorders (AMEND) to their members and worldwide via a social media group for MEN2B patients. Methods The survey consisted of a detailed questionnaire analysing the MSK-related symptoms and structural deformities of MEN2B patients and their impact on patient's lives. Participants Forty-eight participants completed the survey. Results Participants reported several musculoskeletal complaints; the most prevalent being musculoskeletal weakness at 73% (n = 35) and pain 58% (n = 28). The median pain score was 7 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-8) and the frequency of pain was daily in 44% (n = 15) and constant in 21% (n = 7). Structural complaints were common with 63% (n = 30) stating their physique was 'different' and 40% (n = 19) describing marfanoid body features. Spinal curvature and foot deformities were the commonest structural abnormalities with scoliosis 70% (n = 16) and pes cavus 63% (n = 22) prevailing. Dental problems were mentioned by 69% (n = 33) with interdental spacing being the most common complaint at 61% (n = 20). The musculoskeletal symptoms of MEN2B had a median impact of 6 (IQR: 3-9) on quality of life (QOL) with structural deformities 53% (n = 18) and pain 26% (n = 9) listed as having the highest impact. Poor MSK health affected exercise, work and mobility. Conclusions We report a high prevalence of musculoskeletal-related complaints in MEN2B which significantly affects QOL. This suggests a need to provide better holistic care including a multidisciplinary team with physiotherapist, orthopaedic and dental specialist input.

TI  - Eating disorders in university students in Lodz, the role of a family physician
T2  - FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE REVIEW
AB  - Background. Eating disorders (EDs) seem to be a serious health problem in contemporary Polish society. Family Physicians (FPs) have a vital and pivotal role to play in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of EDs.
   Objectives. To determine the prevalence of EDs among students in Lodz - one of the biggest university centers in Poland; the main causes and triggers of EDs and the role of an FP.
   Material and methods. A voluntary anonymous questionnaire concerning ED prevalence, attitude to ED treatment and potential risk factors, including family relations, was distributed on facebook.com via private groups dedicated only to students from leading universities in Lodz (Poland). 651 answers from students 18-46 year of age were collected. The data was analyzed mainly using the chi-square test with Yates correction.
   Results. The research revealed: overall ED prevalence 7.4%; EDs in females 9.5% and 2.5% in males (p = 0.003). ED students more often indicated an unhealthy parent-child relationship as a risk factor (p < 0.001). 49% of students thought that an FP could help with EDs.
   Conclusions. Family dysfunction, peer opinions and the influence of social media are major factors and triggers leading to EDs. FPs could play an important role, as they are well situated among other health professionals, are highly approachable by the local population and may have a unique insight into a patient's condition. Further education and training of FPs and the revision of appropriate guidelines for the management of patients with EDs are essential.

TI  - Representativeness of Black Patients in Cancer Clinical Trials Sponsored by the National Cancer Institute Compared With Pharmaceutical Companies
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
AB  - Background: Many clinical trials supporting new drug applications underrepresent minority patients. Trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial's Network (NCTN) have greater outreach to community sites, potentially allowing better representation. We compared the representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical company-sponsored cancer clinical trials with NCTN trials and with the US cancer population. Methods: We established a large cohort of study publications representing the results of trials that supported new US Food and Drug Administration drug approvals from 2008 to 2018. NCTN trial data were from the SWOG Cancer Research Network. US cancer population rates were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results survey data. We compared the proportion of Black patients by enrollment year for each cancer type and overall. Tests of proportions were used. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: A total 358 trials (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 85; SWOG trials, 273) comprised of 93 825 patients (pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 46 313; SWOG trials, 47 512) for 15 cancer types were analyzed. Overall, the proportion of Black patients was 2.9% for pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials, 9.0% for SWOG trials, and 12.1% for the US cancer population (P<.001 for each pairwise comparison). These findings were generally consistent across individual cancer types. Conclusions: The poor representation of Black patients in pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials supporting new drug applications could result in the use of new drugs with little data about efficacy or side effects in this key population. Moreover, because pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials test the newest available therapies, limited access to these trials represents a disparity in access to potential breakthrough therapies.

TI  - Effects of high-load and low-load resistance training in patients with coronary artery disease: rationale and design of a randomised controlled clinical trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Resistance training (RT) combined with aerobic training (AT) enhances the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it remains to be investigated which type of RT (high loads (HLs) vs low loads (LLs)) is more efficacious in improving exercise performance, cardio-metabolic health and quality of life.
   Methods and analysis A randomised, controlled, clinical trial will enrol 20 patients with CAD into each of three study arms (total 60 patients): HL-RT (70%-80% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)) combined with AT; LL-RT (30%-40% of 1-RM) combined with AT and AT alone as standard care. Primary outcomes (maximal aerobic capacity, maximal leg isometric strength) will be assessed at baseline and after 36 training sessions. Other outcomes will include acute haemodynamic responses to LL-RT and HL-RT, body composition, physical performance, blood biomarkers (lipids, glucose metabolism, inflammation, growth factors), physical activity and quality of life. The intention-to-treat principle will be used to analyse the data.
   Ethics and dissemination The study design and protocol have been approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia (registration number: 0120573/2019/15). The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results of the study will be published as peer-reviewed manuscripts and congress presentations, communicated with patients and the clinical community, and shared through posts on social media. The findings of the study will be disseminated among the national CR clinical community (CR centres, Slovenian association of coronary clubs) with active participation of the patients enrolled in the study. This study will expand our knowledge of RT in combination with AT in CR. We expect to find different effects of HL-RT versus LL-RT, with implications for RT strategies in rehabilitation of patients with CAD.

TI  - Predictors of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility: insights from population-based self-reported survey during lockdown in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown has highlighted the importance of identifying individuals most at risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, underscoring the need to assess factors contributing to susceptibility to disease. With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic and its new variants, there is an inadequate understanding on whether there are certain factors such as a specific symptom or collection of symptoms that combined with life-style behaviors may be useful to predict susceptibility. The study aims to explore such factors from pre-vaccination data to guide public health response to potential new waves. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was distributed through social media during the lockdown period in the United States from April to June 2020. Respondents were questioned regarding COVID testing, presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities, and confirmation of COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. Results: A total of 130 participants deemed as susceptible because they self-reported their perception of having COVID-19 (but without the evidence of positive test) were compared with 130 individuals with documented negative test results. Participants had a mean age of 45 years, and 165 (63%) were female. Final multivariable model showed significant associations with perceived susceptibility for the following variables: fever (OR:33.5; 95%CI: 3.9,85.9), body ache (OR:3.0; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), contact history (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), age > 50 (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1, 6.6) and smoking (OR:3.3; 95%CI: 1.2,9.1) after adjusting for other symptoms and presence of comorbid conditions. The AUROC ranged from poor to fair (0.65-0.76) for cluster of symptoms but improved to a good model (AUROC = 0.803) after inclusion of sociodemographic and lifestyle behaviors e.g., age and smoking tobacco. Conclusions: Fever and body aches suggest association with perceived COVID-19 susceptibility in the presence of demographic and lifestyle behaviors. Using other constitutional and respiratory symptoms with fever and body aches, the parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 80.3% of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. A larger cohort of respondents will be needed to study and refine classifier performance in future lockdowns and with expected surge of new variants of COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome among Saudi population in Riyadh by use of Rome IV criteria and self-reported dietary restriction
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diet may play a role in triggering the symptoms. We aimed to measure the prevalence of IBS and its types, and its association with food restrictions among the Saudi population, using the Rome IV criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient clinics of three major hospitals in Riyadh in conjunction with an electronic survey which was shared on social media. A total of 1,319 subjects (706 males and 613 females) completed a questionnaire of four domains (sociodemography, Rome IV, food restriction, and herbs) between Nov 2019 and February 2020. Convenience sampling was used.Results: IBS was diagnosed in 104 subjects (7.9%) and, of these, 52% were IBS-M (mixed) type. The prevalence was higher in women than in men (4.9% vs. 3.0%; P = 0.006). A significant association was found between the presence of IBS symptoms and low income (P = 0.010), and not working (P < 0.0001). Most of the IBS patients showed food restriction related to milk (P < 0.0001) and legumes (P = 0.0029), besides other types of food and drinks. Conclusions: IBS is less common among the Saudi population. A female gender, low family income, and working status, have the highest association with IBS. The foods most often restricted were legumes and milk. Future community studies may present an opportunity to relate with cultural differences and food preferences.

TI  - Global approaches to cardiogenetic evaluation after sudden cardiac death in the young: A survey among health care professionals
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
AB  - BACKGROUND Thorough investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those aged 1-40 years commonly reveals a heritable cause, yet access to postmortem genetic testing is variable.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore practices of postmortem genetic testing and attitudes of health care professionals worldwide.
   METHODS A survey was administered among health care professionals recruited through professional associations, social media, and networks of researchers. Topics included practices around postmortem genetic testing, level of confidence in health care professionals' ability, and attitudes toward postmortem genetic testing practices.
   RESULTS There were 112 respondents, with 93% from North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand, and 7% from South America, Asia and Africa. Only 30% reported autopsy as mandatory, and overall practices were largely case by case and not standardized. North American respondents (87%) more often perceived practices as ineffective compared to those from Europe (58%) and Australia/ New Zealand (48%; P = .002). Where a heritable cause is suspected, 69% considered postmortem genetic testing and 61% offered genetic counseling to surviving family members. Financial resources varied widely. Half of participants believed practices in their countries perpetuated health inequalities.
   CONCLUSION Postmortem genetic testing is not consistently available in the investigation of young SCD despite being a recommendation in international guidelines. Access to postmortem genetic testing, which is critical in ascertaining a cause of death in many cases, must be guided by well-resourced, multidisciplinary teams.

TI  - The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via staff work and household networks in residential aged-care services in Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been significant among elderly residents of residential aged-care services (RACS). To prevent incursions of COVID-19 in RACS in Australia, visitors were banned and aged-care workers were encouraged to work at a single site. We conducted a review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand how workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS. Design: Retrospective outbreak review. Setting and participants: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020. Methods: The Victorian Department of Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission via households. Results: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak as staff, 91 (4.5%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak through their household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were attributed to staff-household transmission. Conclusions: Limiting worker mobility through single-site policies could reduce the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS to another. However, initiatives that reduce the chance of transmission via household networks would also be needed.

TI  - Effectiveness of Implementing a Locally Developed Antibiotic Use Guideline for Community-Acquired Cellulitis at a Large Tertiary Care University Hospital in Thailand
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. To determine the effectiveness of implementing a locally developed clinical practice guideline (CPG) for antibiotic treatment in adults with community-acquired cellulitis at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Methods. The CPG for antibiotic treatment of community-acquired cellulitis was developed based on local data during June to December 2016. The CPG was introduced by multifaceted interventions, including posters, brochures, circular letters, social media, conference, classroom training, and interactive education during January to September 2018.
   Results. Among 360 patients with community-acquired cellulitis, 84.4% were ambulatory and 15.6% were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 62 years, and 59.4% were female. Antibiotic prescription according to CPG (CPG-compliant group) was observed in 251 patients (69.7%), and CPG noncompliance was found in 109 patients (30.3%) (CPG-noncompliant group). The demographics and characteristics of patients were comparable between groups. Patients in the CPG-compliant group had a significantly lower rate of intravenous antibiotics (18.7% vs 33.9%, P = .007), lower prescription rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics (14.7% vs 78.9%, P < .001) and antibiotic combination (6.4% vs 13.8%, P = .022), shorter median duration of antibiotic treatment (7 vs 10 days, P < .001), lower median cost of antibiotic treatment (US $3 vs $7, P < .001), and lower median hospitalization cost (US $601 vs $1587, P = .008) than those in the CPG-noncompliant group. Treatment outcomes were not significantly different between groups.
   Conclusions. Adherence to CPG seems to reduce inappropriate prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotic or antibiotic combination and treatment costs in adults with community-acquired cellulitis without differences in favorable outcomes or adverse events.

TI  - A life course health development model of HIV vulnerabilities and resiliencies in young transgender women in Peru
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY
AB  - BackgroundGlobally transgender women (TW) are at heightened vulnerability for HIV infection. In Lima Peru, sharp increases in HIV prevalence are seen among TW ages 25 years and older highlighting the need for early HIV prevention efforts for young TW. This study conducted in-depth qualitative interviews to elucidate the social and developmental contexts of HIV vulnerability for young TW in Lima Peru.MethodsBetween November 2019 and February 2020, young TW ages 16-24 years (n = 21) in Lima Peru were purposively sampled using in-person (e.g., face-to-face outreach) and online (e.g., social media, networking websites) social network-based methods. Interviews were conducted in Spanish and a rapid qualitative analysis was conducted using a modified immersion crystallization methodology to identify themes.ResultsFive themes emerged, informing the conceptualization of a Life Course Health Development Model of HIV Vulnerabilities and Resiliencies: (1) interpersonal contexts (family, school, partners, sexual debut, trans mothers); (2) structural vulnerabilities (poverty, educational constraints, migration, hostile environments, sex work, police violence); (3) concomitant mental health and psychosocial factors (discrimination, violence, depression, suicidality, substance use, life hopes/dreams/future expectations); (4) gender affirmation processes (gender identity development, hormones, surgery, legal name/gender marker change); (5) HIV prevention and treatment barriers (PrEP uptake, HIV care, condom use, risk reduction).ConclusionsYoung TW experience formidable developmental challenges associated with transphobia, violence, and pre-maturely facing accelerated milestones. Developmentally and culturally appropriate interventions to mitigate HIV vulnerability in Peru are needed, including those that consider co-occurring stigma-related conditions in adolescence and young adulthood.

TI  - The Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Its Relation to Psychiatric Disorders Among Citizens of Makkah Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background and aim: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional bowel disorder. Many adults worldwide have symptoms associated with IBS and are responsible for most gastroenterology visits. The aim of this study is to illustrate and analyze the prevalence of IBS among the general population in Makkah Al-Mukarramah city using the Rome IV criteria in relation to psychiatric disorders.Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on Makkah citizens. The study excluded all residents in Makkah without Saudi nationality or below the age of 18. The survey was created using Google forms and shared randomly on social media. The sample size was calculated using the OpenEpi website v3.0. The online questionnaire is composed of three sections: sociodemographic data, Rome IV criteria with the Bristol Stool Scale, and lastly the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) score for stress, anxiety, and depression. Data were analyzed using SPSS software for Windows V.23, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was obtained for selected risk factors using logistic regression.Results: Nine hundred and twenty-one individuals from Makkah city completed the survey. The overall IBS prevalence was 20.19%. The commonest subtypes of IBS were IBS-M followed by IBS-C (53.8% and 22%, respectively). In the multiple regression analysis, stress (P = <0.001, OR = 2.473) was statistically significantly associated with IBS.Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of IBS among Makkah citizens is high. Stress was found to be a major risk factor for IBS.

TI  - Zika Virus Awareness and Prevention Practices Among University Students in Miami: Fall 2016
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR
AB  - In January 2016, the first case of mosquito-borne Zika infection in the mainland United States was confirmed in Miami, Florida. The first locally acquired case was reported 6 months later. Local public health and school officials began warning students of the outbreak on their return to the classroom in August 2016. In November-December 2016, we conducted a survey of students attending a large public university in Miami to determine how well informed they were about Zika. A multistage sampling design was used to contact teaching assistants and ask them for help in recruiting their students. Eligible students had to be 18 years of age or older and enrolled in at least one three-credit course during fall semester. A 25-item questionnaire based on the World Health Organization Zika Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice Resource Pack was developed, pretested, and approved by the university's institutional review board before it was made available to eligible students through Blackboard Learn or a survey link. About half (50.4%) of the 139 respondents had heard about Zika prior to 2016. Only one student was unaware of Zika before our survey. Most (47.1%) first learned about Zika through television, 18.8% from family or friends, and 15.2% from the Internet, social media, or university e-mail. Two thirds (66.2%) believed Zika could be prevented, 15.1% thought it might be prevented, and 85.7% had taken some precautions. A high level of awareness of the risk of Zika infection was apparent. Most students reported taking steps to avoid exposure to the Zika virus.

TI  - Protocol of a randomised clinical trial to integrate mental health services into primary care for postconflict populations in Northern Sri Lanka (COMGAP-S)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Sri Lanka has a long history of armed conflict and natural disasters increasing the risk of mental health disorders in the population. Due to a lack of specialist services, there is a treatment gap between those seeking and those able to access mental health services. The aim of this research programme is to integrate mental health services into primary care to meet the needs of this postconflict population.
   Methods and analysis This is a stepped wedge cluster design randomised clinical trial of the WHO mental health Gap Action Programme primary care mental health training intervention. We will provide a 10-day training to primary care practitioners of 23 randomly selected primary care facilities aimed at increasing their ability to identify, treat and manage common mental health disorders. Public health professionals and community representatives will receive a tailored training intervention to increase mental health awareness. Refresher courses will occur at 3 and 6 months post training. Supervision and monitoring will occur for 1 month pre and post training. Target sample sizes have been calculated separately for each group of participants and for each outcome.
   Ethics and dissemination This trial has received ethical approval from the Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University, UK (SC/jc/ FMFREP/16/17 076) and from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka (J/ERC/17/81/NDR/0170) and non-engagement approval has been received from the funding body, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018-015). All participants gave written consent. Dissemination of study results will be completed through publication of academic articles, conference presentations, town hall meetings, written pamphlets in plain language, reports to Ministry of Health and other government organisations and through social media outlets.

TI  - Community perspectives on spinal cord injury in rugby union: facts and fears
T2  - SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN FOOTBALL
AB  - IntroductionThe sport of rugby union, henceforth rugby, is associated with a risk of spinal cord injury (SCI). Perceived risks can impact participation. Understanding community perspectives on rugby-related SCI may provide insight for addressing concerns around risk. The aim of this study was to explore community perspectives through social media discussion about SCI in rugby union.MethodsPosts about SCI in rugby union were identified using the advanced search function on Twitter. Data (content as original post, retweet, quote tweet and comments) were included if focused on Rugby Union and written in English. Inclusion dates (July 2018 to June 2019) were chosen to capture a period when several SCI (n = 4) occurred in community rugby in Australia. Data were analysed using a thematic approach.ResultsFour themes were derived from the collected data. The 'pendulum swing' relates to the disparate views of rugby, from being overly cautious to too dangerous to play. The 'role of rugby culture' described engrained behaviours and attitudes on and off-field toward safety. 'Media influence' describes the emotive narrative used when reporting rugby-related SCI. 'After the injury' looks at expressions of sympathy and inspiration. These findings showed how individuals' views of SCI were influenced through rugby culture, trust in governing bodies and the news media.ConclusionBy 'listening in' to community views, their most pertinent safety concerns can be addressed. Both facts and fears on rugby-related SCI were evident, and these extreme views can be balanced with evidence-based education and sensible risk management.

TI  - Concussion History, Reporting Behaviors, Attitudes, and Knowledge in Jockeys
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To examine concussion history, knowledge, and attitudes among Irish professional and amateur jockeys. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Questionnaire was distributed through e-mails sent to all licensed jockeys, over social media and during professional and amateur race meetings. Participants: An average of 23.6% (12%-44%) Irish professional and amateur jockeys (n = 119) holding a license in 2017. Main Outcome Measures: Jockeys reported their previous concussion history, actions after their most recent concussion and responded to questions examining their knowledge and attitudes toward concussion. Results: Amateur (32.4%) and professional (19.6%) jockeys, who were never medically diagnosed over their career, suspected that they had sustained a concussion. Jockeys displayed good knowledge of concussion signs and symptoms; yet, one in 2 jockeys would continue to ride out the same day if they suspected they had a concussion. They were less likely if they had a race that day. Reasons for continuing to ride include not considering a concussion as serious (85.7%); risk of losing the ride (84.0%); not wanting to let anyone down (77.8%); and considered it a sign of weakness (74.1%). Risky behavior was more common after a suspected concussion than a medically diagnosed concussion. Conclusions: Underreporting of concussions is proposed as a serious concern, and concussion understanding and attitudes can impact reporting. To address the issue of underreporting of concussions in Irish horseracing, there is a need to educate jockeys and the wider racing community on the importance of timely concussion assessments and access to appropriate management systems.

TI  - Pivoting injury prevention efforts during a pandemic: results of an international survey
T2  - INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY
CP  - 27th Annual Injury Free Coalition for Kids (R) Conference - Forging New Frontiers - Keeping All Kids Safe - Equity in Injury Prevention and Addressing Injuries During Covid
AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 a pandemic changed the world. Public health directives to socially distance with stay-at-home orders altered injury risk factor exposure, resulting injury patterns and conducting injury prevention (IP). The objective of this study was to determine the impact the COVID-19 pandemic on injury and IP at North American trauma centers (TC).ResultsSixty-two responses were received from pediatric (44%), adult (11%), and combined (31%) TC, from 22 American states, 5 Canadian provinces and Australia. The majority (91%) of programs targeted age groups from birth to 15 years old. Nearly one-third reported IP to be less of an institutional priority with funding redistributed in 15% of centers [median (IQR) - 25% (- 43, 1)], and resultant staffing changes at 38% of centers. A decrease in IP efforts was reported at 64% of TC. Overall, the majority of respondents reviewed injury data, with the top reported increased mechanisms mainly intentional: Firearm-related (75%), assaults (72%), and abuse (71%). Leading increased unintentional injuries were injuries occurring in the home such as falls (70%), followed by ATV (62%), and cycling (57%). Sites pivoted by presenting (74%) or participating (73%) in IP education virtually, social media posts (61%) and the addition of technology (29%). Top barriers were redeployment of partners (45%) and staff (31%), as well as lack of technology (40%) in the target population. Facilitators were technology at TC (74%), support of trauma program (63%), and having IP funding maintained (55%).ConclusionsNearly two-thirds of TC decreased IP efforts during the pandemic due to staffing and funding reductions. The leading reported increased injuries were intentional, indicating that violence prevention is needed, along with support for mental health. While TC successfully pivoted by using technology, access issues in the target population was a barrier resulting in health inequities.

TI  - COVID-19, Diabetes, and Associated Health Outcomes in China: Results from a Nationwide Survey of 10 545 Adults
T2  - HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH
AB  - This study examined the associations between diabetes and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during China's nationwide quarantine. The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0% without diabetes). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.

TI  - Paving the Way for the Implementation of a Decision Support System for Antibiotic Prescribing in Primary Care in West Africa: Preimplementation and Co-Design Workshop With Physicians
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Suboptimal use of antibiotics is a driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can assist prescribers with rapid access to up-to-date information. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the introduction of CD SS for antibiotic prescribing could have a measurable impact. However, interventions to implement them are challenging because of cultural and structural constraints, and their adoption and sustainability in routine clinical care are often limited. Preimplementation research is needed to ensure relevant adaptation and fit within the context of primary care in West Africa.
   Objective: This study examined the requirements for a CDSS adapted to the context of primary care in West Africa, to analyze the barriers and facilitators of its implementation and adaptation, and to ensure co-designed solutions for its adaptation and sustainable use.
   Methods: We organized a workshop in Burkina Faso in June 2019 with 47 health care professionals representing 9 West African countries and 6 medical specialties. The workshop began with a presentation of Antibioclic, a publicly funded CDSS for antibiotic prescribing in primary care that provides personalized antibiotic recommendations for 37 infectious diseases. Antibioclic is freely available on the web and as a smartphone app (iOS, Android). The presentation was followed by a roundtable discussion and completion of a questionnaire with open-ended questions by participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Most of the participants had access to a smartphone during their clinical consultations (35/47, 74%), but only 49% (23/47) had access to a computer and none used CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. The participants considered that CDSS could have a number of benefits including updating the knowledge of practitioners on antibiotic prescribing, improving clinical care and reducing AMR, encouraging the establishment of national guidelines, and developing surveillance capabilities in primary care. The most frequently mentioned contextual barrier to implementing a CD SS was the potential risk of increasing self-medication in West Africa, where antibiotics can be bought without a prescription. The need for the CDSS to be tailored to the local epidemiology of infectious diseases and AMR was highlighted along with the availability of diagnostic tests and antibiotics using national guidelines where available. Participants endorsed co-design involving all stakeholders, including nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, as central to any introduction of CDSS. A phased approach was suggested by initiating and evaluating CDSS at a pilot site, followed by dissemination using professional networks and social media. The lack of widespread internet access and computers could be circumvented by a mobile app with an offline mode.
   Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information for the development and implementation of a CDSS for antibiotic prescribing among primary care prescribers in LMICs and may, in turn, contribute to improving antibiotic use, clinical outcomes and decreasing AMR.

TI  - An Alternative to Traditional Bedside Teaching During COVID-19: High-Fidelity Simulation-Based Study
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Bedside teaching is integral to medical education and has been highlighted to improve clinical and communication skills, as well as clinical reasoning. Despite the significant advantages of bedside teaching, its usage within medical education has been declining, and COVID-19 has added additional challenges. The pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in opportunities to deliver bedside teaching due to risk of viral exposure, patients declining student interactions, and ward closures. Educators have therefore been required to be innovative in their teaching methods, leading to the use of online learning, social media platforms, and simulation. Simulation-based education allows for learning in a low-risk environment and affords the opportunity for deliberated repeated practice with case standardization. The results demonstrate that simulation-based training can increase students' confidence, increase the rates of correct clinical diagnoses, and improve retention of skills and knowledge when compared with traditional teaching methods.
   Objective: To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 upon bedside teaching for third year students at Hull York Medical School amid closure of the cardiorespiratory wards, a high-fidelity simulation-based model of traditional bedside teaching was designed and implemented. The objectives of the teaching session were to enable students to perform history taking and a focused cardiorespiratory clinical examination in a COVID-19-safe environment using SimMan 3G.
   Methods: Four clinical teaching fellows with experience of simulation-based medical education scripted histories for 2 common cardiorespiratory cases, which were asthma and aortic stenosis. The simulation sessions were designed for students to take a focused cardiorespiratory history and clinical examination using SimMan 3G. All cases involved dynamic vital signs, and the simulator allowed for auscultation of an ejection systolic murmur and wheezing in accordance with the cases chosen. Key aspects of the pathologies, including epidemiology, differential diagnoses, investigations, and management, were summarized using an interactive PowerPoint presentation, followed by a debriefing session.
   Results: In total, 12 third year medical students undertook the sessions, and overall feedback was highly positive. Of the 10 students who completed the feedback questionnaires, 90% (n=9) felt more confident in their clinical examination skills following the teaching; 100% (n=10) of the students responded that they would recommend the session to a colleague; and implementation of regular simulation was frequently requested on feedback. These results are in keeping with the current literature.
   Conclusions: Bedside teaching continues to face ongoing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as declining patient recruitment and fluctuations in clinical findings. The support for simulation-based medical education is derived from high-quality studies; however, studies describing the use of this technology for bedside teaching in the undergraduate curriculum are limited. The authors describe a highly effective teaching session amid the pandemic, which allowed for maintenance of staff and student safety alongside continued education during a challenging time for educators globally.

TI  - The relationship of nurses' psychological well-being with their coronaphobia and work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and Objectives This study aimed to determine the relationship of nurses' psychological well-being with their coronaphobia and work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background COVID-19 is a global life-threatening disease. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects nurses' mental health. No studies have been conducted to determine the factors that affect nurses' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. If nurses' psychological well-being is impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of nursing care and the nurses' performance may be negatively affected. Design This is a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline checklist for cross-sectional studies was used for reporting in this study. Methods The study population consisted of the nurses working in a Health Application and Research Center in Turkey. Data were collected using Google forms between June-August 2020. The study sample consisted of 295 nurses who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and used social media tools. The data were collected using a Sociodemographic Characteristics Form, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S), the Work-Life Balance (WLB) Scale and the Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale. The factors that affect psychological well-being were determined using the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results The nurses' work-life balance and psychological well-being were negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their COVID-19 phobia was mild-to-moderate level. The nurses' psychological well-being was significantly affected by the variable of neglecting life the most, followed by coronaphobia and work-life balance, which explain 75% of the variance. Conclusions This study shows that coronaphobia experienced by nurses and work-life balance was related to their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Managers should take measures (regulating the working hours) to decrease nurses' COVID-19 phobia (education, counselling or psychotherapy) and work-life imbalance. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses' peers, managers and organisations need to take into account nurses' negative emotions and behaviours and organise training programmes to help them overcome their fears, communicate clearly and provide for their basic needs. Organisations, including managers and nurses, must recognise the distress being experienced by their nurses and create safe environments in which to have significant conversations. Nurses' mental health can be screened regularly by multidisciplinary teams, psychological support can be provided when required, and working hours can be regulated through appropriate shifts and breaks that will ensure work-life balance during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses receiving emotional support from their families and friends (via chatting and sharing troubles) can also contribute positively. These measures and regulations will positively affect nurses' psychological well-being and contribute to an increase in the quality of care and nurses' performance.

TI  - Concussions and Injuries in Sledge Hockey: Grassroots to Elite Participation
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To examine injury (including concussion) rates, location, type, mechanisms, and risk factors in sledge hockey players. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Sledge hockey players, worldwide, across all levels of play. Participants: Sledge hockey players (ages >= 14 years) who played in the 2019 to 2020 season were recruited through email, social media, and word of mouth communication. Assessment of Risk Factors: Participant characteristics (eg, age, sex, disability) were examined as potential injury risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Injury rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) examining potential risk factors were reported based on univariate Poisson regression analyses. Injury proportions by type, location, and mechanism were described. Results: Ninety-two players initiated the survey, and 77 (83.7%) provided some injury information. Forty-seven injuries included 16 concussions in 9 of 77 players (11.7%) and 31 non-concussion injuries in 20 of 77 players (26.0%) were reported. The overall IR was 13.2 injuries/1000 athlete-exposures [95% confidence interval (CI); 9.6-17.6]. The game IR (28.4 injuries/1000 game-exposures, 95% CI; 18.6-41.7) was higher than practice IR (4.4 injuries/1000 practice-exposures, 95% CI; 2.2-7.9) (IRR = 6.5, 95% CI; 3.1-14.5). The most common injury locations were the head (34.0%), wrist/hand (14.8%), and shoulder (10.6%). The most common significant injury types were concussion (36.2%) and bone fracture (8.5%). Body checking was the primary mechanism for injuries caused by contact with another player (42.1%) Age, sex, disability, and level of play were not found as injury risk factors. Conclusions: Concussions and upper extremity injuries were the most common sledge hockey injuries reported, with body checking being the most common mechanism. This research will inform development of prevention strategies in sledge hockey.

TI  - Technology-based communication among Hurricane Maria survivors in the United States: a trans-territorial lens
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Rooted in a trans-territorial framework, the present study was designed to provide new evidence regarding the patterns of communication among Hurricane Maria survivors who migrated to the U.S. in the aftermath of the storm. Methods A total of 319 Hurricane Maria survivor adults ages 18 and older were recruited into the Adelante Boricua study between August 2020 and October 2021. Most participants had relocated to the U.S. between 2017 and 2018. We used latent profile analysis and multinomial regression to examine the relationship of technology-based communication with depressive symptoms, well-being, cultural connection, and migration stress. Results We identified a five-class solution, consisting of (1) moderate communication (32%), (2) disengaged (24%), (3) no social media (18%), (4) daily with family in Puerto Rico (6%), and (5) daily trans-territorial (13%) typologies. Participants in the disengaged class were more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms and limited English proficiency, lower prosocial behaviors, lower levels of religiosity, lower attendance at religious services in the U.S., and less engagement in social activities, compared to participants in the Moderate Communication class. Conclusion Roughly one in four individuals in our sample reported very limited technology-based communication with friends/family in their sending and new-receiving communities. As technology and smartphones continue to become integrated into 21st-century life, it is vital that researchers explore how the tremendous potential for connectedness relates to trans-territorial crisis migrants' well-being and adaptation.

TI  - Increasing COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish speakers in the USA: protocol for the development and evaluation of the <i>Nuestra Comunidad Saludable</i> intervention using a group-randomised trial design
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionOur community-based participatory research partnership aims to expand understanding of the social, ethical and behavioural implications of COVID-19 testing and vaccination to inform the development of an integrated intervention that harnesses community-based peer navigation and mHealth strategies to improve COVID-19 testing and vaccination; test the intervention; and develop and disseminate practice, research and policy recommendations to further increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine communities in the USA.
   Methods and analysisWe will conduct 50 individual in-depth interviews with health providers, who have conducted COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination activities within Spanish-speaking communities, and with representatives from Latine-serving community-based organisations. We will also conduct six focus groups with 8-12 Spanish-speaking Latine community member participants each for a total number of about 60 focus group participants. Next, we will develop the Nuestra Comunidad Saludable intervention based on findings from interviews and focus groups and use a longitudinal group-randomised trial design with two arms (intervention and delayed intervention) to evaluate the impact of the intervention. We will recruit, enrol and collect baseline data from 20 community-based peer navigators (Navegantes) and their social network members (n=8 unique social network members per Navegante). Navegantes (coupled with their social networks) will be randomised to intervention or delayed intervention groups (10 Navegantes and 80 social network members per group).
   Ethics and disseminationEthical approval for data collection was granted by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Following the description of study procedures, we will obtain consent from all study participants. Study findings will be disseminated through an empowerment theory-based community forum, peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings, and reports and briefs for lay, community and practitioner audiences.Trial registration numberNCT05302908.

TI  - Evaluation of hepatitis B knowledge, practices, and beliefs among the Jordanian population: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study aimed to assess the knowledge, practices, and beliefs among the Jordanian population regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. A cross-sectional questionnaire was designed and used to recruit participants from October 5th through December 12(th). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyse the sociodemographic data, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality, Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaire and Point-biserial correlation was used to figure out whether there is an association between Score of knowledge and the dichotomous variables. A random sample of 432 participated in the study. The majority were females (n = 310, 71.8%), the mean age was 21 (42.0%) years,416 (96.3%) were urban inhabitants and most of them (n = 351, 81.3%) had bachelor's degree. School/university (n = 280, 64.8%) were reported as a major source of information followed by TV/internet/social media 276 (63.9%). The total mean (+/- SD) of knowledge score regarding HBV infection symptoms, transmission modes and treatment was found 12.28 +/- 3.2. Participants' knowledge regarding symptoms including nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite was 73 (16.9%). More than 80% had good knowledge regarding the complications of HBV infection. Only 100 participant reported vaccination (23.1%) against the virus. Poor knowledge and low vaccination rate against HBV were found thus implementing comprehensive educational program for people highlighting the importance of vaccination against the virus is crucial.

TI  - Pediatric biobanks to enhance clinical and translational research for children
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - Including children in biomedical research is an argument for continual reflection and practice refinement from an ethical and legal standpoint. Indeed, as children reach adulthood, a reconsent method should be used, and data connected with samples should ideally be updated based on the children's growth and long-term results. Furthermore, because most pediatric disorders are uncommon, children's research initiatives should conform to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by worldwide scientific organizations for successfully sharing data and samples. Here, we examine how pediatric biobanks can help address some challenges to improve biomedical research for children. Indeed, modern biobanks are evolving as complex research platforms with specialized employees, dedicated spaces, information technologies services (ITS), and ethical and legal expertise. In the case of research for children, biobanks can collaborate with scientific networks (i.e., BBMRI-ERIC) and provide the collection, storage, and distribution of biosamples in agreement with international standard procedures (ISO-20387). Close collaboration among biobanks provides shared avenues for maximizing scarce biological samples, which is required to promote the translation of scientific breakthroughs for developing clinical care and health policies tailored to the pediatric population. Moreover, biobanks, through their science communication and dissemination activities (i.e., European Biobank Week), may be helpful for children to understand what it means to be engaged in a research study, allowing them to see it as a pleasant, useful, and empowering experience. Additionally, biobanks can notify each participant about which projects have been accomplished (i.e., through their websites, social media networks, etc.); they can facilitate future reconsent procedures and update sample-associated data based on the children's growth. Finally, because of the increasing interest from public and commercial organizations in research efforts that include the sharing and reuse of health data, pediatric biobanks have a crucial role in this context. Consequently, they could benefit from funding opportunities for sustaining research activities even regarding rare pediatric disorders.Conclusion: Pediatric biobanks are helpful for providing biological material for research purposes, addressing ethical and legal issues (i.e. data protection, consent, etc.), and providing control samples from healthy children of various ages and from different geographical regions and ethnicities. Therefore, it is vital to encourage and maintain children's engagement in medical research programs and biobanking activities, especially as children become adults, and reconsent procedures must be applied.

TI  - Characterization of Chronic Urticaria and Associated Conditions-A Web-Based Survey
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
AB  - Introduction: Chronic urticaria is a common disease, characterized by the development of wheals, angioedema, or both, which can be associated with several comorbidities. Most of the available studies have focused on specific common comorbidities and their association with CU, but have seldom reported the overall burden of comorbidities.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate and analyze self-reported comorbidities in Polish patients with CU. Methods: An anonymous online survey consisting of 20 questions was conducted on members of an Urticaria group on the social media platform Facebook. A total of 102 people took part in this survey. The results were analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2016.Results: In the group, 95.1% were females and 4.9% males, with a mean age of 33.8 years. The most common diagnosed type of urticaria was spontaneous (52.9%). Angioedema accompanied urticaria in 68.6% of the respondents, mainly those with delayed pressure urticaria (86.4%). 85.3% of respon-dents reported comorbidities, most often atopic diseases and allergies (49%), chronic inflammation and infections (36.3%), thyroid (36.3%) and psychiatric disorders (25.5%). Moreover, in 30.4% of patients, at least one autoimmune disease was noted. As compared to the patients without autoim-mune urticaria, many more with autoimmune urticaria had a coexisting autoimmune disease (50% vs. 23.7%). Family history of autoimmune diseases was positive in 42.2%, and the familial history of urticaria and atopy was positive in 7.8% and 25.5%, respectively.Conclusions: The knowledge of comorbidities of chronic urticaria may support clinicians to manage and treat patients with this common condition.

TI  - Recruiting and Engaging Women of Reproductive Age with Obesity: Insights from A Mixed-Methods Study within A Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Engaging women with obesity in health-related studies during preconception is challenging. Limited data exists relating to their participation. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences and opinions of women participating in a weight-related, preconception trial. This is an explanatory sequential (quan-QUAL) mixed-methods Study Within A Trial, embedded in the GetGutsy randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN11295995). Screened participants completed an online survey of eight questions (single or multiple choice and Likert scale) on recruitment, motivations and opinions on study activities. Participants with abdominal obesity (waist circumference >= 80 cm) were invited to a subsequent semi-structured, online focus group (n = 2, 9 participants) that was transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, with a pragmatic epistemological approach. The survey (n = 102) showed the main research participation motivations were supporting health research (n = 38, 37.3%) and wanting health screening (n = 30, 29.4%). Most participants were recruited via email (n = 35, 34.7%) or social media (n = 15, 14.7%). In the FGs, participants valued flexibility, convenience and. research methods that aligned with their lifestyles. Participants had an expanded view of health that considered emotional well-being and balance alongside more traditional medical assessments. Clinical trialists should consider well-being, addressing the interconnectedness of health and incorporate a variety of research activities to engage women of reproductive age with obesity.

TI  - Preferences of men who have sex with men for performing anal self-examination for the detection of anal syphilis in Australia: A discrete choice experiment
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
AB  - Background Regular anal self-examination could potentially reduce syphilis transmission by detecting anal syphilis earlier among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to examine the preferences of MSM on performing anal self-examination to detect anal syphilis.
   Methods An online survey with a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was distributed to MSM attending a sexual health clinic and through social media in Australia between June and November 2020. The DCE examined the preferred attributes of anal self-examination that would encourage MSM to perform anal self-examination. Data were analysed using a random parameters logit (RPL) model.
   Findings The median age of 557 MSM who completed the survey was 35 (inter quartile range, 27-45). The choice to perform anal self-examination was most influenced by two attributes: the accuracy of anal self-examination to diagnose anal syphilis, and the frequency of anal self-examination, followed by the type of instruction materials to perform anal self-examination, waiting time for medical review, and type of support received if abnormalities were found. Using the most preferred attributes, 98% of people would conduct anal self-examination compared with 35% when the least preferred anal self-examination attributes were offered.
   Interpretation If anal self-examination were recommended for anal syphilis screening, it will be important to consider preferences of MSM: men were more likely to undertake anal self-examination if the frequency was once a month and there was higher accuracy of detecting anal syphilis.

TI  - Understanding Weight Loss via Online Discussions: Content Analysis of Reddit Posts Using Topic Modeling and Word Clustering Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancers. Online social media platforms are popular among people seeking social support regarding weight loss and sharing their weight loss experiences, which provides opportunities for learning about weight loss behaviors.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the content posted by users in the r/loseit subreddit, an online community for discussing weight loss, and online interactions were associated with their weight loss in terms of the number of replies and votes that these users received.
   Methods: All posts that were published before January 2018 in r/loseit were collected. We focused on users who revealed their start weight, current weight, and goal weight and were active in this online community for at least 30 days. A topic modeling technique and a hierarchical clustering algorithm were used to obtain both global topics and local word semantic clusters. Finally, we used a regression model to learn the association between weight loss and topics, word semantic clusters, and online interactions.
   Results: Our data comprised 477,904 posts that were published by 7660 users within a span of 7 years. We identified 25 topics, including food and drinks, calories, exercises, family members and friends, and communication. Our results showed that the start weight (beta=.823; P<.001), active days (beta=.017; P=.009), and median number of votes (beta=.263; P=.02), mentions of exercises (beta=.145; P<.001), and nutrition (beta=.120; P<.001) were associated with higher weight loss. Users who lost more weight might be motivated by the negative emotions (beta=-.098; P<.001) that they experienced before starting the journey of weight loss. In contrast, users who mentioned vacations (beta=-.108; P=.005) and payments (beta=-.112; P=.001) tended to experience relatively less weight loss. Mentions of family members (beta=-.031; P=.03) and employment status (beta=-.041; P=.03) were associated with less weight loss as well.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that both online interactions and offline activities were associated with weight loss, suggesting that future interventions based on existing online platforms should focus on both aspects. Our findings suggest that online personal health data can be used to learn about health-related behaviors effectively.

TI  - Use of Anti-epileptic Drugs for Post Traumatic Seizure: A Global Survey
T2  - ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - BackgroundPost traumatic seizures (PTS) and post traumatic epilepsy (PTE) are potential consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is no consensus regarding its management among treating doctors. PurposeWe have undertaken a global survey to assess the variability of management practices of PTS and PTE and highlight the pressing need to formulate uniform practice guidelines. MethodsA questionnaire consisting of sixteen questions were developed with the help of Google survey and sent through e-mail, or social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger or Telegram, to practicing Neurologists and Neurosurgeons round the world. ResultsThere were a total of 220 responses. Majority of our responders (n = 202; 91.8%) would start an anti-epileptic (AED) prophylaxis to prevent PTS; 18 people (8.18%) told that they would not start AED prophylaxis for TBI. Phenytoin (n = 98; 48.5%) followed by Levetiracetam (n = 78; 38.6%) was the preferred drug, although the latter was significantly preferred by high and upper middle-income countries (p001). Majority (n = 99; 49%) would not use it beyond two weeks. Most clinicians would manage PTE with a single drug (n = 160; 72.7%) either Phenytoin (n = 69; 31.3%) or levetiracetam (n = 67; 30.4%). Most of them (n = 174; 86%) would treat for less than one year. ConclusionsPractices in the management of PTS and PTE vary widely among clinicians. Our study point towards the need for the development of a more robust and comprehensive practice guidelines for the management of the same.

TI  - Addressing common questions on food oral immunotherapy: a practical guide for paediatricians
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
AB  - Food allergy has been increasing in prevalence in most westernised countries and poses a significant burden to patients and families; dietary and social limitations as well as psychosocial and economic burden affect daily activities, resulting in decreased quality of life. Food oral immunotherapy (food-OIT) has emerged as an active form of treatment, with multiple benefits such as increasing the threshold of reactivity to the allergenic food, decreasing reaction severity on accidental exposures, expanding dietary choices, reducing anxiety and generally improving quality of life. Risks associated with food immunotherapy mostly consist of allergic reactions during therapy. While the therapy is generally considered both safe and effective, patients and families must be informed of the aforementioned risks, understand them, and be willing to accept and hedge these risks as being worthwhile and outweighed by the anticipated benefits through a process of shared decision-making. Food-OIT is a good example of a preference-sensitive care paradigm, given candidates for this therapy must consider multiple trade-offs for what is considered an optional therapy for food allergy compared with avoidance. Additionally, clinicians who discuss OIT should remain increasingly aware of the growing impact of social media on medical decision-making and be prepared to counter misconceptions by providing clear evidence-based information during in-person encounters, on their website, and through printed information that families can take home and review.

   Methods: Participants were recruited via advertisements circulated through social media, community presentations and equestrian organisations. Participants were sent a web link to an online questionnaire previously designed for high school athletes and modified to ensure relevance to equestrian activities. The percentage of correct responses per item and a total knowledge score were calculated. Differences in concussion knowledge by age, sex, level of experience and previous history of concussion were explored using t-tests, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and effect sizes.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 1486 participants (Mean age = 39.1 +/- 15.4). Knowledge of what concussion was, how to recognise it and key symptoms (except poor sleep) was high (>80%). In contrast, awareness of guidelines was moderate (56%) and inability of helmets to prevent concussion was low (12%). Significantly higher levels of knowledge of concussion were identified in females compared with males (t=-6.55 p <0.001, 95%CI=-3.26 to -1.75). The majority (87%) of participants reported that a helmet should be replaced after a fall, yet 46% reported re-using a helmet following a hit to the head.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of and attitudes towards concussion were positive. However, there were knowledge gaps and discrepancies between some attitudes and behaviour on some aspects of concussion. Targeted campaigns to promote awareness of concussion and improve recognition and onward management are needed. Education related to equestrian activities such as helmet use and injury mechanisms is needed to change behaviour and minimise the risk of injury. (C) 2020 Sports Medicine Australia.

TI  - Intersection of surgical injuries and pain interference among former female collegiate gymnasts
T2  - PM&R
AB  - Background Gymnastics is a competitive sport with numerous health benefits. However, few data exist that examine the lasting effects of injuries in retired gymnasts. Objective To examine pain interference among former collegiate gymnasts. Specifically, we focused on the relationship between gymnastics-related injuries sustained during middle/high school or college that required surgery and former collegiate gymnasts' current pain. We hypothesized that injuries requiring surgery would be associated with increased pain and reduced function after retirement. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting An online questionnaire was distributed to former female collegiate gymnasts via social media. Participants A total of 447 former female collegiate gymnasts completed the survey and were grouped according to whether they indicated an injury during their middle/high school or collegiate gymnastics career that required surgery. Main Outcome Measures The association between current pain interference (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] scale) and injuries in middle/high school or college that resulted in surgery. Pain interference elements included current enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, participation in day-to-day activities, enjoyment of recreational activities, ability to perform errands, and ability to socialize with others. Results Those who reported an injury that resulted in surgery (n = 260; mean current age +/- SD = 32.8 +/- 9.5 years) were younger than those who did not at the time of survey completion (n = 187; current age: 37.0 +/- 11.0 years) and reported beginning gymnastics at an earlier age (4.4 +/- 2.0 years vs. 5.1 +/- 2.5 years; p = .001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on any PROMIS questions. In secondary analyses, we found a small but significant association between beginning gymnastics at an earlier age and the odds of requiring surgery (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.21; p = .02). Conclusions Most retired gymnasts reported a gymnastics-related injury that required surgery. Gymnasts who start gymnastics at a younger age were more likely to sustain an injury that required surgery, but surgery was not associated with higher levels of pain interference.

TI  - Life after sepsis: an international survey of survivors to understand the post-sepsis syndrome
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB  - Objective In this study, we aim to describe the post-sepsis syndrome from the perspective of the sepsis survivors.
   Design and Setting The study is a prospective, observational online international survey.
   Participants Sepsis survivors enrolled via social media from 13 September 2014 to 13 September 2016.
   Interventions None.
   Main Outcome Measures Physiologic, physical and psychological function post-sepsis; and patient satisfaction with sepsis-centered care.
   Results 1731 completed surveys from 41 countries were analyzed, with 79.9% female respondents, age 47.6 14.4 years. The majority of respondents (47.8%) had sepsis within the last year. Survivors reported an increase in sensory, integumentary, digestive, breathing, chest pain, kidney and musculoskeletal problems after sepsis (all P-value <0.0001). Physical functions such as daily chores, running errands, spelling, reading and reduced libido posed increased difficulty (all P-value <0.0001). Within 7 days prior to completing the survey, the survivors reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep disturbance. Sepsis survivors reported dissatisfaction with a number of hospital support services, with up to 29.3% of respondents stating no social services support was provided for their condition.
   Conclusions Sepsis survivors suffer from a myriad of physiologic, physical and psychological challenges. Survivors overall reveal dissatisfaction with sepsis-related care, suggesting areas for improvement both in-hospital and post-discharge.

TI  - Protocol for a case-control diagnostic accuracy study to develop diagnostic criteria for psoriasis in children (DIPSOC study): a multicentre study recruiting in UK paediatric dermatology clinics
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Diagnosing psoriasis in children can be challenging. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to ensure patients receive psoriasis specific treatment and monitoring. It is recognised that the physical, psychological, quality of life, financial and comorbid burden of psoriasis are significant. The aim of this study is to develop clinical examination and history-based diagnostic criteria for psoriasis in children to help differentiate psoriasis from other scaly inflammatory rashes. The criteria tested in this study were developed through a consensus study with a group of international psoriasis experts (International Psoriasis Council).
   Methods and analysis Children and young people (<18 years) with psoriasis (cases) and other scaly inflammatory skin diseases (controls) diagnosed by a dermatologist are eligible for recruitment. All participants complete a single research visit including a diagnostic criteria assessment by a trained investigator blinded to the participant's diagnosis. The reference standard of a dermatologist's diagnosis is extracted from the medical record. Sensitivity and specificity of the consensus derived diagnostic criteria will be calculated and the best predictive criteria developed using multivariate logistic regression.
   Ethics and dissemination Health Regulatory Authority and National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approvals were granted in February 2017 (REC Ref: 17/EM/0035). Dissemination will be guided by stakeholders; patients, children and young people, dermatologists, primary care and paediatric rheumatologists. The aim is to publish the study results in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal, present the findings at international academic meetings and disseminate more widely through social media and working with patient associations.

TI  - A framework to integrate innovations in invasion science for proactive management
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a rising threat to biodiversity, national security, and regional economies, with impacts in the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Proactive or predictive approaches guided by scientific knowledge are essential to keeping pace with growing impacts of invasions under climate change. Although the rapid development of diverse technologies and approaches has produced tools with the potential to greatly accelerate invasion research and management, innovation has far outpaced implementation and coordination. Technological and methodological syntheses are urgently needed to close the growing implementation gap and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and synergy among evolving disciplines. A broad review is necessary to demonstrate the utility and relevance of work in diverse fields to generate actionable science for the ongoing invasion crisis. Here, we review such advances in relevant fields including remote sensing, epidemiology, big data analytics, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, genomics, and others, and present a generalized framework for distilling existing and emerging data into products for proactive IAS research and management. This integrated workflow provides a pathway for scientists and practitioners in diverse disciplines to contribute to applied invasion biology in a coordinated, synergistic, and scalable manner.

TI  - Assessment of Knowledge and Attitude Toward Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Among Women in Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - PurposePelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a serious infection of the female reproductive system that can lead to long-term complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy. PID is also associated with an increased risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Early diagnosis and treatment of PID is crucial to prevent complications. Despite the severe consequences of PID, many women are unaware of the risks associated with this condition. This lack of awareness can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of complications. This study explores women's knowledge and attitudes regarding PID.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted using a bilingual, community-based questionnaire, circulated using different social media platforms. A total of 239 participants were selected through convenient non-probability sampling from the public in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp. Released 2019. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The chi-square test was applied to determine the differences between knowledge and attitude levels with participants' socio-demographic characteristics. A p-value <0.005 was considered statistically significant.ResultsAppropriate PID knowledge level was found only in 32% of the respondents and was significantly associated with the respondents' family history of the PID (p=0.025). A positive attitude toward PID/STI was also observed only in 36% of the study participants, which was significantly associated with the respondents' age (p`0.001), marital status (p`0.001), occupation (p` 0.001), past medical/surgical history (p=0.006), and family history of the PID (p`0.009).ConclusionThe present study reported average levels of appropriate knowledge and attitudes toward PID among female respondents, which could be further improved by increasing PID/STI awareness programs.

TI  - The prevalence of renal stones among local residents in Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
AB  - Background: Urolithiasis is the most common urological problem worldwide. It is a recurrent multifactorial problem that is caused by the interaction of several environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of renal stones among local residents in Saudi Arabia in order to renew the statistics of renal stones occurrence in the current Saudi population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic questionnairethat was distributed randomly through phones and social media to reach the local residents in Saudi Arabia. We then reviewed the published papers in Saudi journals for patients with renal stones. Results: From a total of 580 responders to the electronic questionnaire, the prevalence of renal stones was 9.1% (n = 64). The median age at diagnosis was 29 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 36.91 years (SD = 18.66, Range of 20-99). Two peaks of age were observed, the first peak was at the (21-25) age group representing 34.4% of the kidney stones patients. The second peak was older than 47 years. The majority of those diagnosed with kidney stones had normal BMI (n = 29, 45.3%), and the family history of kidney stones among first degree relatives was found in 35.9% of the cases (n = 23). Conclusion: Kidney stones is a common health problem with the local incidence being underreported. In our sample, the prevalence was 9.1%. We also observed a relatively high percentage of positive family history among renal stone patients (34.9%) that could be attributed to the high rates of consanguinity. We encourage more local epidemiological studies to describe the patterns and the contributing factors of the development of kidney stones.

TI  - Public Knowledge and Attitude toward Vitiligo in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY & DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY-JDDS
AB  - Background: Knowledge and positive attitude toward vitiligo would foster support for affected individuals, improving their sense of well-being and possibly treatment outcome. Purpose: To evaluate the levels of public knowledge and attitude toward vitiligo among Saudis. Methods:A cross-sectional study among 12,181 participants. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire enquiring about knowledge, attitude, and perceptions in vitiligo. Results: The response rate was 95.4%. Most respondents had heard about vitiligo (96.9%). The median knowledge score was four out of eight and median attitude score was six out of eight. Social media/Internet was the most commonly reported source of information (34.7%), followed by family/friends/acquaintances (30%). Higher proportions of correct responses were recorded regarding the noninfectious nature of vitiligo (85.0%) and whether vitiligo was dangerous or connected to skin cancer (63.4%). However, unsatisfactory responses were found regarding the immunological basis of the condition: only 24.3% knew that vitiligo was an immune disease and 24.5% knew about the role of heredity in vitiligo. The majority of respondents did not mind employing patients with vitiligo (89.0%). Only 40.6% responded that they would many someone with vitiligo. Positive attitude was significantly common in respondents aged 31-50 years (P < 0.01), women (P < 0.01), and those who had a university degree or higher (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although overall attitude toward vitiligo patients was positive, there were gaps in the knowledge, particularly regarding the nature of the disease. More awareness and education are required to improve attitude toward vitiligo patients, with an aim to improve their overall well-being.

TI  - Contraceptive Access and Use Among Undergraduate and Graduate Students During COVID-19: Online Survey Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread college campus closures in the months of March to June 2020, endangering students' access to on-campus health resources, including reproductive health services.Objective: To assess contraceptive access and use among undergraduate and graduate students in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at degree-granting institutions in North Carolina. Participants were recruited using targeted Instagram advertisements. The survey queried several aspects of participants' sexual behavior, including sex drive, level of sexual experience, number of sexual partners, digital sexual experience, dating patterns, and types of contraception used. Participants were asked to compare many of these behaviors before and after the pandemic. The survey also assessed several sociodemographic factors that we hypothesized would be associated with contraceptive use based on prior data, including educational background, sexual orientation and gender minority status (ie, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer), health insurance status, race, ethnicity, degree of sensation seeking, religiosity, and desire to become pregnant.Results: Over 10 days, 2035 Instagram users began our survey, of whom 1002 met eligibility criteria. Of these 1002 eligible participants, 934 completed the survey, for a 93% completion rate. Our respondents were mostly female (665/934, 71%), cisgender (877/934, 94%), heterosexual (592/934, 64%), white (695/934 75%), not Hispanic (835/934, 89%), and enrolled at a 4-year college (618/934, 66%). Over 95% (895/934) of respondents reported that they maintained access to their preferred contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a multivariable analysis, participants who were enrolled in a 4-year college or graduate program were less likely to lose contraceptive access when compared to participants enrolled in a 2-year college (risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71); in addition, when compared to cisgender participants, nonbinary and transgender participants were more likely to lose contraceptive access (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.01-5.87). Respondents reported that they were more interested in using telehealth to access contraception during the pandemic. The contraceptive methods most commonly used by our participants were, in order, condoms (331/934, 35.4%), oral contraception (303/934, 32.4%), and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC; 221/934, 23.7%). The rate of LARC use among our participants was higher than the national average for this age group (14%). Emergency contraception was uncommonly used (25/934, 2.7%).Conclusions: Undergraduate and graduate students in North Carolina overwhelmingly reported that they maintained access to their preferred contraceptive methods during the COVID-19 pandemic and through changing patterns of health care access, including telehealth. Gender nonbinary and transgender students and 2-year college students may have been at greater risk of losing access to contraception during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Reproducibility and relative validity of a newly developed web-based food-frequency questionnaire for assessment of preconception diet
T2  - BMC NUTRITION
AB  - BackgroundThe importance of diet and nutrition during preconception age is a window of opportunity to promote future parental and transgenerational health. As a sub-study to a large Norwegian study, 'Diet today - health of tomorrow', a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess diet during the preconception phase in young adults aged 20 - 30years and in this paper we report the reproducibility and relative validity of this questionnaire.MethodsThe FFQ was developed from an existing FFQ validated in adolescents. Participants were recruited on social media and at a university. Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the test and retest of the FFQ. Relative validity was assessed by comparing intake measured by the FFQ with a 7-day weighed food record. Energy, nutrients and food intake were used to assess the reproducibility and relative validity of the FFQ. The study applied the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, percentage of agreement and Cohen's Kappa to assess reproducibility and validity.ResultsThere were 32 participants recruited to the study, of which 21 participants completed both the test-retest reproducibility and the relative validation. The test-retest reproducibility had a median correlation coefficient of 0.85 for energy and nutrients, a median Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.75 and a median Cohen's Kappa of 0.51 for food groups. The relative validity of the FFQ had a median correlation coefficient of 0.59 for energy and nutrients, a median Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.54 and a median Cohen's Kappa of 0.28 for food groups.ConclusionThis newly developed FFQ for preconception diet in young adults had a satisfactory test-retest reproducibility and fair relative validity.

TI  - Closing the Breast Cancer Loop: Barriers and Perceptions of Breast Reconstruction among Rural Women
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
AB  - Background:
   Despite policies such as the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) and Breast Cancer Patient Education Act, rates for breast reconstruction vary and are especially low for some subpopulations of patients, especially rural women. In order to better understand patient perceptions, qualitative analysis using focus groups is an underutilized tool for obtaining patient perspectives regarding health-related issues and access to care. Our aim was to better understand patient perceptions using qualitative analysis.
   Methods:
   Three focus groups were held in rural counties within West Virginia in order to better understand patient perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs regarding breast health, breast cancer, access to breast reconstruction, and how to disseminate and educate this patient population regarding their right to accessing breast reconstruction.
   Results:
   Major themes analyses revealed perceived barriers to care related to lacking care coordination, lack of insurance coverage and other resources, as well as issues related to transportation. Participants consistently discussed avoiding breast screening care due fear and denial in addition to pain. Few patients were aware of their right to accessing breast reconstruction per the WHCRA, and many were concerned about follow-up burden, complications, and general fear related to breast reconstruction. Themes related to dissemination of information to promote the option of breast reconstruction included social media, patient counseling by their referring physician, and other means of intervention in clinics and other points in the care coordination chain.
   Conclusions:
   Rural women have important, unique viewpoints regarding access to and perceived barriers from obtaining breast reconstruction. Plastic surgeons must work diligently to educate, disseminate, and improve care coordination among this population in order to improve access to breast reconstruction among rural breast cancer patients.

TI  - Acceptance, hesitancy and refusal towards COVID-19 vaccination
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Problem: The determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal remain poorly understood. We assessed the general population of Pune after visiting tertiary care hospital for their willingness to accept the vaccine and the reason for their hesitancy and refusal.Methodology: A six-month descriptive cross-sectional study with 386 community members over the age of 18 who visited the Tertiary Hospital OPD was conducted. The vaccine acceptance and hesitancy was assessed using a self designed detailed questionnaire with a one-time face-to-face interview.Results: Acceptance for vaccine was observed in 235 (60.8%) participants, while 151 (39.2%) hesitated and refused. Participants with lower education (P < 0.00001), no employment did not readily accept the vaccine (P < 0.00001). Pregnant, breast-feeding women (21.8%) hesitated vaccine because of lack of evidence regarding vaccine safety. Participants (73.6%) were readily accepting (third dose) booster dose of vaccine when available. The reason for vaccine hesitance was the concern about side effects (58.2%) and reason for acceptance was to get immunity against COVID-19 (76.1%). Vaccine information source appears to be an influential aspect, as participants who obtained vaccination information from healthcare providers had no concerns regarding vaccination.Conclusion: The study has found a link between average education level, unemployment and vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy include lack of vaccine information, vaccine side effects, and misinformation spread via social media. Clinical pharmacists can play an important role in boosting up vaccine acceptance by providing appropriate information in community.

TI  - A Cross-Sectional Survey of Knowledge of Skin Cancer in Saudi Arabia
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
AB  - Background: Skin cancer has become one of the world's leading health problems, and incidence rates are on the rise. The leading causes of skin cancer are sun exposure, family history and sunburn, and the most agreed-upon preventative behaviors are sunscreen application and sun avoidance.
   Objectives: This study assessed the knowledge of the causes of skin cancer and awareness of preventative m ca res in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 529 participants in a WhatsApp group over 3 months. Consenting participants completed a validated, 18-item questionnaire.
   Results: Of 529 total participants, nearly 55% of participants reported an awareness of skin cancer, 35% understood its metastasis and 55.1% knew about its spread. However, 44% of participants were unaware of the different types of the disease. Social media was reported to be the most common source of information. The majority of participants were able to identify symptoms of skin cancer and had knowledge of risk factors. Most participants understood proper preventative measures, and reported that they use sunscreen regularly.
   Conclusions: The general knowledge of skin cancer in Saudi Arabia is not high but is increasing. However sun-protective behaviors are lacking, despite the population's knowledge of the benefits. Awareness campaigns and incentive programs may encourage better preventative behavior. Future studies should explore participants' awareness of more specific aspects of skin cancer using a more diverse and extensive population sample.

TI  - A survey of psychological distress among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies conducted on the psychological impact of infectious outbreaks have found heavy psychological burdens among general population with more severe affect in the current pandemic. The main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher psychological distress.
   Methods: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate of 34%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome variable by exposure variables.
   Results: Overall, 44.3% of respondents were suffering from mild to moderate distress and 9.5% were suffering from severe distress. Female respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet region (p-value = 0.035).
   Conclusion: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by different symptoms and predictors. This study suggest the need to develop comprehensive crisis prevention system including epidemiological monitoring, screening, and referral with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress.

TI  - Elementary school teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward emergency management of traumatic dental injuries
T2  - BRAZILIAN ORAL RESEARCH
AB  - The consequences of traumatic dental injuries can be even more serious when their emergency management procedures are inadequate. Since traumatic accidents frequently occur at school, it is crucial that teachers be knowledgeable enough to assist an injured child. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the elementary school teachers of a Brazilian city toward dental trauma in permanent teeth, and its emergency practices. A combination of convenience and snowball sampling methods was used. An online questionnaire was distributed through social media, consisting of three parts: demographic characteristics and professional information; previous experiences and attitudes toward dental trauma; teachers' knowledge of this subject. Descriptive and statistical analyses were carried out. Pearson chi-squared test (p < 0.05) was used. A total of 217 teachers participated in the study. The power of the sample was 95%. Half of the teachers had already witnessed a dental trauma incident involving students, and 70.5% never received any information on the subject. The teachers who were provided previous information were the ones who opted to search for the tooth fragment (p=0.036) in cases of crown fracture, and for the lost tooth (p = 0.025) in cases of avulsion. They were also the ones who chose to wash the tooth in running water (p = 0.018), and look for a dentist in the first 30 or 60 minutes after the trauma (p = 0.026). Most of the teachers assessed did not have adequate knowledge of dental trauma. Having previous information was associated with more assertive practices in trauma management.

TI  - Impact on mental health care and on mental health service users of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods survey of UK mental health care staff
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. Methods We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.

TI  - 'It all dials back to safety': A qualitative study of social and economic vulnerabilities among transgender women participating in HIV research in the USA
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives
   Transgender women (TW) are highly burdened by HIV infection in the USA. Research is needed into drivers of the HIV epidemic for TW, including longitudinal studies to identify risks for incident HIV infection and optimal intervention targets. This formative research sought to understand TW's experiences with, perceptions of and barriers and facilitators to HIV research participation to inform future research implementation.
   Design
   Between August 2017 and January 2018, five online synchronous computer-mediated focus groups were conducted in English and two in Spanish. Recruitment used a mixed format of technology, such as geotargeted social media, and non-technology infused methods, such as peer referrals. Maximum variation sampling was used to enrol participants across a wide range of characteristics. Qualitative codes were iteratively developed and applied to focus group discussion transcripts by independent analysts.
   Setting
   Participants were recruited from Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City and Washington D.C.
   Participants
   Participants identified as TW >= 18 years and resided in one of the six metropolitan areas or outlying regions. 33 participants elected to partake in English focus groups and eight participated in Spanish-led groups.
   Results
   The geographically diverse sample had a mean age of 41.1 years (SD=13.6), and 34% identified as Black African American and 29% as Hispanic/Latina. Social and economic factors were found to shape HIV research participation for TW. Barriers to HIV research participation included limited research opportunities, mistrust, fear of mistreatment, safety and confidentiality, competing priorities and HIV stigma. Facilitators to HIV research participation were peer involvement and engagement, monetary and non-monetary incentives, flexibility and choices, multiple modalities and methods, and transcenteredness.
   Conclusion
   It is critical to address the social and economic vulnerabilities surrounding HIV research participation for TW. Results from this study can inform the design and implementation of gender-affirming and culturally tailored approaches to HIV research with TW.

TI  - Population Size Estimation of Female Sex Workers in Hai Phong, Vietnam: Use of Three Source Capture-Recapture Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: A study was conducted in three districts in Hai Phong province, Vietnam to estimate the population size of the Female Sex Workers (FSW) in June-July 2019.
   Methods: The procedures included selection of three districts, compilation of a list of accessible venues where FSW congregate, distribution of first unique objects (first capture) and second unique objects (second capture) to FSW in randomly selected venues and implementation of a Mini-Respondent Driven Sampling (mRDS) Survey (third capture). Population size of the FSW was calculated based on the number of FSW in each round, number of FSW 'recaptured' during the second and the third captures. Additionally, personal network size data captured in the mRDS was used to measure the population of FSW within the three districts using Successive Sampling Population Size Estimates (SS-PSE).
   Results: The total estimated FSWs in the three selected districts, using Three Source Capture-Recapture (3S-CRC) was 958, which is slightly lower than that estimated using SS-PSE - 1192. The 3S-CRC method yielded a provincial estimate of 1911 while the SS-PSE method resulted in a total of 2379 FSW for the province.
   Conclusion: Two techniques produced different PSE at both the district and the province levels and resulted in estimates lower than ones produced using programmatic data. For planning HIV prevention and care service needs among all FSWs, additional studies are needed to estimate the number of sex workers who are not venue-based and use social media platforms to sell services.

TI  - Factors Influencing Monkeypox Vaccination: A Cue to Policy Implementation
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundFollowing the mpox 2022 outbreak, several high-income countries have developed plans with inclusion criteria for vaccination against the mpox disease. This study was carried out to map the factors influencing mpox vaccination uptake to help address the challenges and increase vaccination confidence.MethodsThis was a study based on Tweet analysis. The VADER, Text Blob, and Flair analyzers were adopted for sentiment analysis. The "Levesque conceptual framework for healthcare access" was adopted to evaluate the factors impacting access and the decision to get mpox vaccination. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) criteria were adopted.FindingsA total of 149,133 tweets were extracted between 01/05/2022 and 23/09/2022. Around 1% of the random tweets were used for qualitative analysis. Of the 149,113, tweets were classified as positive, negative and neutral, respectively, by (a) VADER: (55,040) 37.05%, (44,395) 29.89%, and (49,106) 33.06%, (b) TextBlob: (70,900) 47.73%, (22,729) 15.30%, and (54,921) 36.97%, and (c) Flair: (31,389) 21.13%, (117,152) 78.87%, and 0.00%. Sentiment trajectories revealed that communication, stigmatization, accessibility to and availability of vaccines, and concerns about vaccine safety as factors influencing decision-making in the content and flow of tweets.InterpretationTwitter is a key surveillance tool for understanding factors influencing decisions and access to mpox vaccination. To address vaccine mistrust and disinformation, a social media-based risk communication plan must be devised. Adopting measures to remove logistical vaccination hurdles is needed. Obtaining fact-based information from credible sources is key to improving public confidence.

TI  - Use of online promotion to encourage patient awareness of aspirin use to prevent heart attack and stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background Literature on health promotion evaluation and public understanding of health suggests the importance of investigating behaviour over time in conjunction with information environment trends as a way of understanding programme impact. We analysed population response to online promotion of an educational tool built by the Ask About Aspirin campaign in the USA to inform people about aspirin as a preventive aid.
   Methods We collected 156 weeks of time series data on audience behaviour, namely use of a self-assessment tool. We then used the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling to predict that outcome as a function of paid search engine advertising, paid social media promotion and general search interest in aspirin.
   Results Through ARIMA modelling of tool engagement data adjusted for outcome series autocorrelation, we found a significant effect of online promotional effort on audience behaviour. Total paid search advertising positively predicted weekly total of individuals who started using the self-assessment tool, coefficient=0.023, t=3.28, p=0.001. This effect did not appear to be an artefact of broader secular trends, as Google search data on the topic of aspirin use did not add explanatory power in the final model nor did controlling for general search interest eliminate the significant coefficient for paid search promotion.
   Conclusion Results hold implications both for educational tool development and for understanding health promotion campaign effects. We witnessed substantial but ephemeral effects on tool use as a function of paid search efforts, suggesting prioritisation of efforts to affect search engine results as a dissemination tactic.

TI  - Which older emergency patients are at risk of intracranial bleeding after a fall? A protocol to derive a clinical decision rule for the emergency department
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Falling on level ground is now the most common cause of traumatic intracranial bleeding worldwide. Older adults frequently present to the emergency department (ED) after falling. It can be challenging for clinicians to determine who requires brain imaging to rule out traumatic intracranial bleeding, and often head injury decision rules do not apply to older adults who fall. The goal of our study is to derive a clinical decision rule, which will identify older adults who present to the ED after a fall who do not have clinically important intracranial bleeding.
   Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study enrolling patients aged 65 years or older, who present to the ED of 11 hospitals in Canada and the USA within 48 hours of having a fall. Patients are included if they fall on level ground, off a chair, toilet seat or out of bed. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of clinically important intracranial bleeding within 42 days of the index ED visit. An independent adjudication committee will determine the primary outcome, blinded to all other data. We are collecting data on 17 potential predictor variables. The treating physician completes a study data form at the time of initial assessment, prior to brain imaging. Data extraction is supplemented by an independent, structured electronic medical record review. We will perform binary recursive partitioning using Classification and Regression Trees to derive a clinical decision rule. Ethics and dissemination The study was initially approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research
   Ethics Committee and subsequently approved by the research ethics boards governing all participating sites. We will disseminate our results by journal publication, presentation at international meetings and social media.

TI  - Adolescents' mental health status and influential factors amid the Coronavirus Disease pandemic
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background
   The preventive measure of Coronavirus Disease pandemic, such as nationwide lockdown, might lead to stress, depression, and anxiety, prominently in adolescents. Many factors were indicated to influence its severity. This study aimed to investigate the magnitude of COVID-19-related mental health problems in adolescents and the associated factors.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study gathered 2018 adolescents throughout Indonesia from April 22nd-28th 2020. The questionnaire was spread through social media and included Kessler-10 Psychological Distress scale and closed-ended questions about the risk and protective factors. The results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Logistic Regression.
   Results
   The participants were mostly males (91.8%) with a median age of 19. The results showed 54.1% experienced varying degrees of distress. All variables were significantly related with psychological distress during Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis test. The logistic regression analysis showed maintaining or improving dietary pattern and sleep quality was found to be protective against psychological distress (OR = 0.497,95%CI = 0.34-0.725 and OR = 0.515,95%CI = 0.372-0.714, respectively), while others were risk factors, i.e.: Not having a confidant (OR = 1.539,95%CI = 1.226-1.931), frequent argument with parents (OR = 1.735,95%CI = 1.343-2.24), feeling worried (OR = 2.364, 95%CI=1.528-3.656), chronic diseases (OR = 2.601,95%CI = 1.468-4.606), and mental illnesses (OR = 9.866,95%CI = 3.855-25.249).
   Conclusion
   More than half of adolescents experienced distress. The findings called for initiatives by experts in providing psychosocial support for adolescents.

TI  - Physicians, pharmacists, and dentists' knowledge and attitudes toward the use of electronic cigarettes
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: E-cigarettes (e-cigs) are typically promoted as a safer alternative to traditional cigarette smoking, particularly through social media platforms. E-cigs smoking is spreading at a high rate among young adults.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of e-cigs usage among Health Care Professionals (HCPs) in Jordan, as well as to investigate their knowledge and attitudes concerning e-cigs use.Methods: Eligible participants were asked to answer an electronic cross-sectional questionnaire. A total of 532 online questionnaires were completed. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess HCPs' knowledge and attitudes regarding e-cigs use.Results: Approximately 16.9 % of HCPs were e-cigs ever users. According to the multivariate analysis, HCPs who used conventional cigarettes were 7.3 times more likely to use e-cigs (p-value<0.001). Being a male was 2.8 times more likely than a female to have ever used e-cigs (p-value = 0.008). Those who lived alone were 3 times more likely to use e-cigs than those who lived with relatives or friends (p-value = 0.007). Furthermore, being exposed to e-cigs' secondhand smoke from a family member (p-value = 0.038), friend (p-value = 0.008) or roommate (p-value = 0.008) increased the likelihood of being an e-cigs ever-user. HCPs stated that they hadn't received adequate education regarding e-cigs during college study.Conclusions: The study's outcomes have uncovered the need for educational interventions to promote HCPs comfort upon dealing with e-cigs use. Moreover, there is a further need to focus on substance use education, including e-cigs, in health schools.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, risk perception and coping strategies among health care workers in Albania-evidence that needs attention
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted health care workers in many ways including mental health. This impact is usually underestimated in particular in developing countries. Objectives: The study aims to assess the level of anxiety, depression, risk perception, and coping strategies of Albanian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associated factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted from April to May 2020 by recruiting health care personnel through the snowballing method. Data collection was carried out through social media using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) by Google forms. Participants were recruited from all health care sectors including doctors, nurses, etc. working in both the public and private sectors.
   Results: 410 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Most participants were nurses (59.3%), female (78.5%), and belonged to the age group 26-40 years (46.3%). Mild levels of anxiety were expressed in 26.9% of participants while 7.2% of them expressed moderate levels. 23.1% and 12.1% of participants expressed respectively mild and moderate depression levels. High levels of risk perception were found. A statistical association was found between occupation (p = 0.011), gender (p = 0.031), providing care for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.011), and the availably of mental health support in the workplace. Poor coping strategies were reported among participants.
   Conclusions: Mental health support should be a priority of the healthcare system in particular for young health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients. It can improve the mental health status of health care workers and their family members, impacting the quality of care provided.

T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: The future and progress of a country is dependent on the children today. The advent of social media has been a double-edged sword by the way it has brought us closer and also resulted in anonymous ways of mental distress to children, which is already being tested by violent school environments and pressure to succeed resulting in the prevalence of different mental illness. Parents and school authorities should ensure that their children grow and thrive in the best and safest environment possible. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Mental Health Programme on promoting mental health characteristics among adolescents in a school located in Coimbatore. Method: A quasi experimental one group pre-test and post-test design was adapted for the study. A sample of 195 students were selected using stratified random proportionate sampling technique and made to answer the pre-test questionnaire followed by the mental health programme intervention. They were then made to answer the post-test questionnaire and the data was analysed. The data collection was initiated on June 2015 and ended on October 2016, the entire process took approximately 48 weeks excluding holidays and examinations. Result: The pre-test mean score was 8.35 +/- 3.02 and the post-test mean score was 26.77 +/- 2.94 with a mean gain score of 18.42. The calculated paired 't' produced at value 62.278 which was found to be statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results of the present study concluded that the mental health promotion programme was effective in improving the mental health characteristics among adolescent children.

TI  - Prevalence and Risk Factors of Renal Stones Among the Bisha Population, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: In urolithiasis, urinary calculi are formed in the urinary system. Stone development does not initially result in any symptoms, but later renal colic, flank pain, hematuria, obstruction of urine flow, and/or hydronephrosis may indicate renal stone disease. In addition to age, gender, ethnicity, and local climate, urolithiasis can be caused by several other factors. The prevalence and recurrence rate of kidney stone disease is rising globally, while few effective treatment options currently exist. Methods: Between June and October 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted. An electronic questionnaire subdivided into three categories was used to determine the prevalence and identify the factors that increase the likelihood of developing urolithiasis among the population in Bisha. The collected data were reviewed and analyzed via IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Results: A total of 1,002 participants filled out the questionnaire. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to over 60 years, with an average age of 26.1 & PLUSMN; 13.9 years. There were 451 female participants (45%), and 927 (92.5%) were Saudis. According to the participants' body mass index, 98 (9.8%) were underweight, 388 (38.7%) were normal weight, 300 (29.9%) were overweight, and 216 (21.6%) were obese. The total number of participants with urolithiasis was 161 (16.1%), and 420 (41.9%) had a family history of renal stones. Urolithiasis was found to be significantly associated with family history, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, gout, and chronic kidney disease. Older age and female gender were also associated with the risk of having urolithiasis. Conclusion: This study found urolithiasis to be highly prevalent among the Bisha population. In terms of risk factors, body mass index, smoking, and diabetes were the most significant. Based on the findings of this study, the authors recommend more public education regarding urolithiasis and its risk factors, emphasizing the importance of preventing the disease and the ways of treating urolithiasis through medical campaigns and social media.

TI  - Impact of change in household hygiene conditions on morbidity in India: Evidence from longitudinal survey
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - The maintenance of good hygiene is more important to prevent communicable and infectious diseases. Therefore, the main aim of this study to assess the impact of change in household hygiene conditions on morbidity. The results from multivariate linear regression have shown that the percentage share of households members fell sick due to any short term morbidity were significantly higher (beta = 0.053, P < 0.001) among the households who had lived in the poor hygiene conditions in both years in 2005 and 2011 compared to the households who were lived in the better-off hygienic condition in both years in 2005 and 2011 after controlling various socio-economic variables. The household members who fell sick due to any short term morbidity had significantly declined (beta = -0.028, P < 0.04) among the households who were lived in the poor condition in 2005, but transformed into better off hygienic condition as a compared to the households who were lived in the poor hygienic condition in both years in 2005 and 2011. Similarly, the results from multinomial logistic regression shown that prevalence of any short term morbidity was significantly less likely among the households who were livid remain in the better-off hygienic condition in both years in 2005 and 2011 (2.8%; p < 0.01) as compared to other households who were lived remain in the poor hygiene conditions in 2005 and 2011 (4.8%). Findings of this study suggest that not only improve the water and sanitation facilities which are prerequisites for hygiene but also improve the hygienic behavior of the households through social media.

TI  - Media news on vaccines and vaccination: The content profile, sentiment and trend of the online mass media during 2015-2020 in India
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: The immunization coverage progress in India is relatively slower than anticipated. The rising internet and media penetration and online news contents are likely to shape the public vaccine sentiments and attitude. The measles-rubella immunization campaign in India experienced challenges in some states due to the social media and messaging. This study studied the profile and vaccine sentiments of the online media news in India. Methods: We retrieved the online news on immunization and vaccines published in English during November 2015 to May 2020. The news were analysed for contents and categorised as positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Results: Out of 2626 news retrieved, 1788 eligible ones were analysed. The news focused on immunization program in 59.1% and vaccine hesitancy in 7.7% items. While 42.5% news originated from national level, 33.2% were from six states. Measles-rubella was the leading vaccine in the news (23.2%) followed by coronavirus (12.8%), poliomyelitis (10.4%) and rotavirus (5.1%) vaccines. While 71.4% news conveyed positive sentiment, 23.8% and 4.7% had negative and neutral sentiments, respectively. The negative sentiments focused on adverse events, vaccine hesitancy and resistance. The news volume and negative sentiments were largely linked to the measles-rubella vaccination campaign phases in India. Conclusions: Negative vaccine news constitute a sizable proportion of the online news and can influence the public vaccine sentiment and attitude. The experiences of public response towards measles-rubella, pentavalent and human papillomavirus vaccines suggest necessity of comprehensive media mapping and tracking to guide appropriately to sustain the public vaccine confidence and improve coverage.

TI  - Psychosocial impacts on the Christchurch Muslim community following the 15 March terrorist attacks: a mixed-methods study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction On 15 March 2019, a white supremacist gunman opened fire in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayers, killing 51 people and injuring 40. The event was witnessed by at least 250 survivors and also live streamed on social media, leading to widespread and repeated exposure within the community. It is expected that survivors, families and community members will be at increased risk of developing mental disorders due to the scale and violence of these attacks. This protocol describes the first phase of a proposed longitudinal study to screen and assess the long-term impacts of the terrorist attack on members of the Christchurch Muslim community, to determine clinical need and facilitate access to appropriate interventions and to gain insights into working with such a traumatised, ethnically diverse population. It has been developed in close collaboration with members of that community. Methods and analysis A mixed-method design is described, combining self-report measures with a clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Participants include Christchurch Muslims aged 18 years and over, with a target sample size of n=200. Analyses will determine prevalence of major mental disorders, while regression analyses will model the relationship between pre-event features, trauma exposure and mental disorders. A small number of participants, stratified by exposure type, will also take part in a qualitative interview in English. All study information and self-report measures are provided in translations based on the ethnolinguistic composition of the group and are available in paper and online versions. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee 19/NTA/147. All participants provide informed consent, either written or online via REDCap software. The study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Findings will be disseminated initially to the impacted community, then by publication in scientific journals, presentations and to government agencies.

TI  - Contexts and consequences of dog bite incidents
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY BEHAVIOR-CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH
AB  - Dog bites are a contentious issue within the United Kingdom due to their effect on public health and increasing incidence. Despite multiple expert-led dog bite prevention schemes being available, there is limited evidence regarding the surrounding factors and likely causes of a dog bite (e.g., dog/human behavior). An online convenience sample questionnaire was distributed through social media between December 2015 and February 2016 targeting self-identified dog bite victims within the United Kingdom. A total of 484 responses were received. Victims were aged between 1 and 77 years when bitten. Most dogs (66.1%) were known to the victim. The most common context of a dog bite is related to interacting or attempting to interact with the dog (e.g., stroking, playing, handling, and restraining); however, in many cases, the dog approached the victim (50%). In 27% of cases, the dog was known to have bitten someone previously. If the upper extremities were bitten, it was likely the person approached the dog, whereas for the lower extremities, it was more likely the dog approached the person. Most injuries did not require medical treatment (62.3%), and there was no follow-on consequence for the dog involved (59.9%). Bites to an owner from their own dog were more likely to be seen as "accidental" and "unintentional" than bites from a less familiar dog. This study found contexts in which dog bites occur vary widely, and thus, a number of different prevention measures are required, including addressing repeat biters. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Privacy and Security in a Ubiquitous Health Information Technology World
T2  - NURSING INFORMATICS FOR THE ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE: PATIENT SAFETY, QUALITY, OUTCOMES, AND INTERPROFESSIONALISM, 2ND EDITION
AB  - We have reviewed background information on the protection of healthcare data under the HIPAA regulatory requirements established in 1996 and updates to that regulation enacted with the HITECH Act to increase the protection of data. Each component of HIPAA was discussed, including transactions, privacy, and security rules. We have discussed the enforcement component and how enforcement and audits have increased with sizable penalties for disclosures by organizations across the United States. In addition, we have examined other regulatory requirements, including state laws that can override federal law when considered more stringent with respect to protections. We have also discussed the importance of public trust and nursing roles that are important for establishing strong policies and procedures in protecting the PHI and identity of individuals whom we care for on a daily basis. Most issues with security breaches are related to vulnerabilities created by human errors; therefore, we have also related common incidences of HIPAA violations and reviewed why they occurred and how to mitigate these types of incidents while emphasizing the importance of SRAs in that process. Population health data and the " push and pull" between protecting privacy and disclosing adequate information to address epidemiologic and other research questions were discussed. Also examined was whether we as a nation have the right balance between open government and public disclosure of healthcare data for the common good versus potential risks of disclosing public domain data that might be used to identify individuals. New threats regarding cybersecurity were reviewed with special attention as to why these new threats are occurring, what they are, and what we can do as an industry to guard against these -exposures. Technical terms related to cybersecurity were noted and used within the context of threats that all healthcare professionals should be aware of to help guard against disclosures. Finally, an exercise is presented to consider the SRA tool established by the ONC and the Office of Civil Rights to assess organizations for adequate protections.

TI  - Do neurosurgeons follow the guidelines? A world-based survey on severe traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is going to be the third-leading cause of death worldwide, according to the WHO. Two European surveys suggested that adherence to brain trauma guidelines is poor. No study has compared compliance between low-(LMICs) and high-income (UHICs) countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate differences in the management of severe TBI patients, comparing low-and high-income, and adherence to the BTF guidelines. METHODS: A web-based survey was spread through the Global Neuro Foundation, different neurosurgical societies, and social media. RESULTS: A total of 803 neurosurgeons participated: 70.4 from UHICs and 29.6% from LMICs. Hypertonic was administered as an early measure by the 73% and 65% of the responders in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P=0.016). An invasive intracranial pressure monitoring was recommended by the 66% and 58% of the neurosurgeons in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P<0.001). Antiseizure drugs (P<0.001) were given most frequently in LMICs as, against recommendations, steroids (87% vs. 61% and 86% vs. 81%, respectively). In the LMICs both the evacuation of the contusion and decompressive craniectomy were performed earlier than in UHICs (30% vs. 17% with P<0.001 and 44% vs. 28% with P=0.006, respectively). In the LMICs, the head CT control was performed mostly between 12 and 24 hours from the first imaging (38% vs. 23%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The current Guidelines on TBI do not always fit to both the resources and circumstances in different countries. Future research and clinical practice guidelines should reflect the greater relevance of TBI in low resource settings.

TI  - A cross-sectional study to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding <i>Zika</i> virus among nursing students in a tertiary care center of central India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Recently, the Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a major concern across the world. ZIKV can primarily spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Till now, ZIKV is considered an incurable infectious disease. As Zika is an emerging disease of an international concern with the ongoing speculation about a potential outbreak in India in the future, the present study was conducted with an aim to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding ZIKV among nursing students.
   Materials and Methods: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 240 nursing students during 2019, and data were collected using a pretested, predesigned, standardized, and self-administered questionnaire. The ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical committee before the conduct of the study. All tests were performed at 5% level of significance.
   Results: The present study has included 240 nursing students (228 female students and 12 male students). The most common source of information related to ZIKV was social media among 75.6% of the students and 46.7% of the participants has low knowledge regarding ZIKV. Surprisingly, about one-tenth of the participants (14.2%) made an attempt to gain more knowledge about ZIKV, and nearly one-fifth of the participants were not using any method at all (17.1%) to prevent mosquito bites.
   Conclusion: This study showed inadequate knowledge among nursing students which will be future health care providers about ZIKV infection. The awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and maintained among health care providers to face any possible emergence in the region.
   The following core competencies are addressed in this article: Medical knowledge, Patient care, Practice-based learning, and Systems-based practice.

TI  - Physical activity, resilience, emotions, moods, and weight control, during the COVID-19 global crisis
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives This study aimed at exploring the relationships between physical activity, weight control, and psycho-social aspects of the COVID-19 lockdown, which have characterized the Israeli population's behavior during the COVID-19 global crisis. Design Cross-sectional survey research. Methods Participants included 1855 men and women aged 18 and above, from different regions in the country and representing different sectors. They were recruited through the social media in a "snowball" sampling, and filled out a self-administered six-part survey: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the positive and negative affect scales (PANAS), the Conor and Davidson resilience scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive symptoms, and questions regarding weight change based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Results Routine physical activity (PA) was reported by 76.3% of the participants before the lockdown, 19.3% stopped exercising during this period, and 9.3% began exercising during the lockdown. The participants who were physically active during the lockdown period reported a higher level of resilience and positive feelings, and a lower level of depression, compared with those who were not physically active. People who were physically active during the lockdown maintained their weight compared with those who were inactive. Concerning weight change, 44.8% of the respondents maintained their weight, and a higher percentage of people reported weight gain than those who reported weight loss. Conclusions Continuous PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were associated with higher resilience and positive emotions, and depressive symptoms, in people aged 18 and above. Although a causal link cannot be established, in light of the results of the present study, encouraging physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense of self-efficacy, as well as to maintaining weight during a crisis.

TI  - Promoting vaccination during rapid HIV testing: Recommendations from men who have sex with men in California
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
AB  - Community-based rapid HIV testing is effective for reaching racial-ethnically diverse men who have sex with men (MSM), offering an opportunity for bundled health promotion interventions. Given MSM experience a heightened prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and meningococcal disease, we examined their preferences for bundling rapid HIV testing with an intervention to promote vaccination against these infections. In 2020, we conducted five virtual focus groups (N = 25 participants) in English and Spanish with MSM in Southern California's Inland Empire. Participants discussed their knowledge about HPV and meningitis vaccination and attitudes toward receiving vaccination information and referrals during rapid HIV tests. We used the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique to systematically analyse the data. Participants had a mean age of 30, were socioeconomically diverse, and predominantly (68%) Hispanic. 96% had ever been tested for HIV, while only 28% were vaccinated against HPV and/or meningitis. Most participants were unaware of MSM's elevated risk for HPV and meningitis and were eager to receive vaccination information from LGBTQ+-friendly providers. However, many participants emphasised rapid HIV testing was stressful and anticipated feeling overwhelmed if presented with vaccination information in this setting. Preferred formats for vaccine promotion included pamphlets and resources that could be discretely accessed online, supported by broader advertising featuring diverse MSM on social media, dating apps, and posters in the community. Overall, our findings suggest that bundling health promotion messages with rapid HIV testing may be ineffective, as the anxiety associated with taking an HIV test may interfere with such messages and their impact.

TI  - Food allergen knowledge, attitude and practices among UK consumers: A structural modelling approach
T2  - FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Food allergies are becoming more prevalent and affect up to 1-2% of adults and 5-8% of children in the UK. This study investigated the food allergen knowledge, attitude towards food allergens and food allergy management practices among food allergic and intolerant consumers and/or their family members and carers. Questionnaires were distributed at three major Free From events in the UK in 2017 and 2018. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used as a confirmatory technique to determine the model's validity. Cereals containing gluten, milk and eggs were the most common triggers reported by the consumers. Other trigger foods such as chocolate, garlic, maize, onions, red and white meat, spices, and fruits such as apples and cherries were also reported. Consumers demonstrated very good understanding on the severity of allergic reactions, prevention method and hidden egg ingredients. Overall, consumers were relatively good in the knowledge section. The participants were motivated in their personal allergen avoidance towards food allergens especially in checking food labels, preference for more free from product choices and handwashing. Consumers did not rely on dietary apps or social media to find out about allergen-free food products. Both knowledge and attitude did not translate into food allergy management practices. Significant correlation between knowledge and attitude was identified suggesting that as knowledge decreases, so will their attitude scores. This study suggests that targeted and systematic food allergy management topics and peer support could be used to improve consumers' knowledge and attitude to positively impact food allergen handling practices.

TI  - Phenotypic Environmental Sensitivity and Mental Health During Pregnancy and Post Partum: Protocol for the Experiences of Pregnancy Longitudinal Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Mental health problems during pregnancy and post partum are common and associated with negative short- and long-term impacts on pregnant individuals, obstetric outcomes, and child socioemotional development. Socio-environmental factors are important predictors of perinatal mental health, but the effects of the environment on mental health are heterogeneous. The differential susceptibility theory and the environmental sensitivity framework suggest that individuals differ in their degree of sensitivity to positive and negative environments, which can be captured by individual phenotypes such as temperament and personality. While there is strong evidence for these models in childhood, few studies examined them in adults, and they were not examined in pregnancy.Objective: The primary objective of the Experiences of Pregnancy study is to explore whether childhood and current environments are associated with mental health and well-being in pregnancy and whether these effects depend on individual sensitivity phenotypes (personality). This study also aims to gather important psychosocial and health data for potential secondary data analyses and integrative data analyses. Methods: We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study. The study was not registered elsewhere, other than this protocol. Participants will be recruited through social media advertisements linking to the study website, followed by an eligibility call on Zoom (Zoom Video Communications). Participants must be aged 18 years or older, currently residing in the United States as citizens or permanent residents, and currently planning to continue the pregnancy. A minimum of 512 participants will be recruited based on power analyses for the main objectives. Since the data will also be a resource for secondary analyses, up to 1000 participants will be recruited based on the available budget. Participants will be in their first trimester of pregnancy, and they will be followed at each trimester and once post partum. Data will be obtained through self-reported questionnaires assessing demographic factors; pregnancy-related factors; delivery, labor, and birth outcomes; early infant feeding; individual personality factors; childhood and current environments; mental health and well-being; attachment; and infant temperament. A series of measures were taken to safeguard the study from web robots and fraudulent participants, as well as to reduce legal and socialResults: The study received ethics approval in April 2023 from the University of Oklahoma-Norman Campus InstitutionalConclusions: The Experiences of Pregnancy study will extend theories of environmental sensitivity, mainly applied in children to the perinatal period. This will help better understand individual sensitivity factors associated with risk, resilience, plasticity, and receptivity to negative and positive environmental influences during pregnancy for pregnant individuals.

TI  - "Stop Waking the Dead": Internet Child Sexual Abuse and Perspectives on Its Disclosure
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
AB  - The phenomenon of Internet child sexual abuse (ICSA) has been receiving growing attention over the last decade, and studies have promoted knowledge with respect to the phenomenon's epidemiology, as well as to characteristics of the victims, perpetrators, and dynamics in these cases. The current retrospective study sought to delve into the disclosure component in cases of ICSA. The sample comprised 52 cases of adolescents who arrived at a child advocacy center (CAC) following ICSA. Analysis of these cases was targeted to capture the multifaceted nature of disclosure using those perspectives that could be documented by the CAC staff-of the practitioners, the adolescents, and their parents. Beyond the descriptive results regarding the victims and the nature of the abuse, the case analyses illustrate the disclosure process as experienced by the various parties involved, highlighting the challenging nature of this aspect of the phenomenon. For the parents, the disclosure experience can perhaps be best epitomized by the expression that was heard repeatedly-"Stop waking the dead"-an expression that indicated their wish to bring the subject to a close. The difficulty in disclosing such incidents was also illustrated by the fact that 20 children in the current sample were reluctant to collaborate during the CAC process. In fact, according to these data, most of the incidents were revealed following a police investigation rather than by a disclosure initiated by the children themselves. Focusing on this specific aspect of ICSA-that is, disclosure-enables a new perspective on it and stresses the need to further study it in such cases. A better understanding of the disclosure experience as it pertains to the individuals involved in cases of ICSA may improve and help modify future prevention and intervention efforts in the field.

TI  - Designing a Patient Portal for Patient-Centered Care: Cross-Sectional Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In recent literature, patient portals are considered as important tools for the delivery of patient-centered care. To date, it is not clear how patients would conceptualize a patient portal and which health information needs they have when doing so.
   Objective: This study aimed (1) to investigate health information needs, expectations, and attitudes toward a patient portal and (2) to assess whether determinants, such as patient characteristics, health literacy, and empowerment status, can predict two different variables, namely the importance people attribute to obtaining health information when using a patient portal and the expectations concerning personal health care when using a patient portal.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the Flemish population on what patients prefer to know about their digital health data and their expectations and attitudes toward using a patient portal to access their electronic health record. People were invited to participate in the survey through newsletters, social media, and magazines. We used a questionnaire including demographics, health characteristics, health literacy, patient empowerment, and patient portal characteristics.
   Results: We received 433 completed surveys. The health information needs included features such as being notified when one's health changes (371/396, 93.7%), being notified when physical parameters increase to dangerous levels (370/395, 93.7%), observing connections between one's symptoms or diseases or biological parameters (339/398, 85.2%), viewing the evolution of one's health in function of time (333/394, 84.5%), and viewing information about the expected effect of treatment (349/395, 88.4%). Almost 90% (369/412) of respondents were interested in using a patient portal. Determinants of patients' attachment for obtaining health information on a patient portal were (1) age between 45 and 54 years (P=.05); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested attitude (P=.008) toward shared decision making; and (3) commitment to question physicians' decisions (P=.03, R-2=0.122). Determinants of patients' expectations on improved health care by accessing a patient portal were (1) lower education level (P=.04); (2) neutral (P=.03) or interested attitude (P=.008) toward shared decision making; and (3) problems in understanding health information (P=.04; R-2=0.106).
   Conclusions: The interest in using a patient portal is considerable in Flanders. People would like to receive alerts or some form of communication from a patient portal in case they need to act to manage their health. Determinants such as education, attached importance to shared decision making, difficulties in finding relevant health information, and the attached importance in questioning the decisions of physicians need to be considered in the design of a patient portal.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice toward Testicular Cancer and Testicular Self-Examination among adolescents and young adults in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - WORLD FAMILY MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Testicular cancer incidence rates are increasing worldwide making it the most common malignancy in males aged 15 to 45 years. More than 90% of patients are cured with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone or a combination of them. This success depends on early and accurate disease diagnosis and the application of optimum treatment.
   Aim: to assess adults' awareness, attitude, and practice regarding testicular cancer (TC) and testicular self-examination (TSE) in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia.
   Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all adults in Aseer region. The study was conducted during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire which was developed by the researchers after intensive literature review and expert's consultation. Adults' awareness regarding testicular cancer (TC) was assessed covering its main domains including general definition, signs and symptoms, age of incidence, self-examination methods, and curability. The questionnaire was uploaded online, using social media platforms, by the researchers and their relatives and friends. All adults fulfilling the inclusion criteria who received the electronic questionnaire during the study period were invited to participate through filling out the questionnaire.
   Results: The survey included 809 male participants who completed the questionnaire. Participants ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old with mean age of 26.9 12.7 years. The majority of participants (73.1%; 591) were single while 23.7% were married. Exactly 591 (73.1%) participants had heard about cancer tests and 651 (80.5%) knew it affects men. Regarding age susceptible to testicular cancer, 218 (26.9%) of the participants reported 15-40 years old. About 5.1% of the participants agreed that routine self-examination for TC is not important, 194 (24%) reported it is important.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that male adult's awareness about TC and TSE are inadequate and the proportion who are performing it is below the average. Also, male adults' attitude towards TSE and its importance was not promising.

TI  - Estimating the Size of the MSM Population in Metro Vancouver, Canada, Using Multiple Methods and Diverse Data Sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
AB  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV globally, regionally in Canada, and locally in Vancouver. Lack of reliable population size estimates of MSM impedes effective implementation of health care services and limits our understanding of the HIV epidemic. We estimated the population size of MSM residing in Metro Vancouver drawing on four data sources: the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a cross-sectional bio-behavioural MSM survey, HIV testing services data from sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics serving MSM, and online social networking site Facebook. Estimates were calculated using (1) direct estimates from the CCHS, (2) "Wisdom of the Crowds" (WOTC), and (3) the multiplier method using data from a bio-behavioural MSM survey, clinic-based HIV testing, and online social media network site Facebook. Data sources requiring greater public disclosure of sexual orientation resulted in our mid-range population estimates (Facebook 23,760, CCHS 30,605). The WOTC method produced the lowest estimate, 10,000. The multiplier method using STI clinic HIV testing data produced the largest estimate, 41,777. The median of all estimates was 27,183, representing 2.9% of the Metro Vancouver census male adult population, with an interquartile range of 1.1-4.5%. Using multiple data sources, our estimates of the MSM population in Metro Vancouver are similar to population prevalence estimates based on population data from other industrialized nations. These findings will support understanding of the HIV burden among MSM and corresponding public health and health services planning for this key population.

TI  - The Canadian version of the National Institutes of Health minimum dataset for chronic low back pain research: reference values from the Quebec Low Back Pain Study
T2  - PAIN
AB  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) minimum dataset for chronic low back pain (CLBP) was developed in response to the challenge of standardizing measurements across studies. Although reference values are critical in research on CLBP to identify individuals and communities at risk of poor outcomes such as disability, no reference values have been published for the Quebec (Canada) context. This study was aimed to (1) provide reference values for the Canadian version of the NIH minimum dataset among individuals with CLBP in Quebec, both overall and stratified by gender, age, and pain impact stratification (PIS) subgroups, and (2) assess the internal consistency of the minimum data set domains (pain interference, physical function, emotional distress or depression, sleep disturbance, and PIS score). We included 2847 individuals living with CLBP who completed the baseline web survey of the Quebec Low Back Pain Study (age: 44.0 +/- 11.2 years, 48.1% women) and were recruited through social media and healthcare settings. The mean score was 6.1 +/- 1.8 for pain intensity. Pain interference, physical function, emotional distress or depression, sleep disturbance, and PIS scores were 12.9 +/- 4.1, 14.4 +/- 3.9, 9.8 +/- 4.4, 13.0 +/- 3.6, and 26.4 +/- 6.6, respectively. Emotional distress or depression showed floor effects. Good-to-excellent internal consistency was found overall and by language, gender, and age subgroups for all domains (alpha: 0.81-0.93) and poor-to-excellent internal consistency for PIS subgroups (alpha: 0.59-0.91). This study presents reference values and recommendations for using the Canadian version of the NIH minimum dataset for CLBP that can be useful for researchers and clinicians.

TI  - Link Between the Female Athlete Triad and Gymnastics-Related Injury in Retired Collegiate Gymnasts
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE
AB  - Objectives:To compare gymnastics-related injuries between former collegiate gymnasts who did and did not report components of the female athlete triad (Triad) during college, including disordered eating or menstrual irregularity. We hypothesized that athletes reporting these 2 triad symptoms would have higher rates of time loss injury and injuries requiring surgery.Design:Retrospective case-control.Setting:Online survey.Patients:Four hundred seventy former collegiate gymnasts.Interventions:Athletes completed online survey distributed through social media.Main Outcome Measures:Participants were grouped based on self-reported menstrual irregularity and disordered eating during college. We compared time loss injuries, injuries resulting in surgery, and injury locations between the groups using & chi;(2) analyses.Results:Seventy percent (n = 328) of participants in this study reported a time loss college injury without surgery, and 42% (n = 199) reported an injury during college that required surgical treatment. A significantly greater proportion of gymnasts with only disordered eating reported a time loss gymnastics injury (without surgery) compared with those who reported only menstrual irregularity during college (79% vs 64%; P =0 .03). A significantly greater proportion of the disordered eating-only group reported a spine injury compared with the menstrual irregularity-only group (P = 0.007) and the group who reported neither menstrual irregularity nor disordered eating (P = 0.006).Conclusions:College gymnasts who experienced disordered eating were more likely to experience a nonsurgical time loss injury while in college, as well as spine injury compared with those with menstrual irregularity. Sports medicine providers should be aware of the association between injuries and individual components of Triad in gymnasts beyond bone stress injuries.

TI  - Assessment of the Prevalence of the Use of Nasal Decongestants Among the General Population in Saudi Arabia
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background A topical nasal decongestant (NDC) is widely prescribed in ENT practice and used as self-medication because it is available over the counter, which makes it an easily accessible medication. Due to its common and long-term use, it is associated with serious nasal complications. It is commonly self-administrated in many otolaryngology diseases like the common cold, sinusitis, and acute or chronic rhinitis. The long-term usage of nasal decongestants is associated with significantly increased side effects. AimTo assess the prevalence of the usage of nasal decongestants among the general population in Saudi Arabia ad the pattern of its use. MethodologyA questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was applied to level all available populations in Saudi Arabia. Participants with ages aged 10 to 60 years old in Saudi Arabia were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected from participants using a predesigned online questionnaire. The questionnaire included the participant's demographic data, NDC use, and pattern of use. The questionnaire was uploaded online by researchers and their friends using social media platforms. ResultsA total of 1456 participants completed the study questionnaire. Participants ages ranged from 10 to 60 years with a mean age of 26.9 +/- 12.4 years old. Exact 585 (40.2%) participants were males and 1270 (87.2%) were from urban regions. A total of 657 (45.1%) respondents reported using nasal decongestants while 799 (54.9%) did not use NDC. As for the duration of use, 70.8% used NDC for less than five days and 13.5% used it for 5-15 days. The most reported causes of using NDC were nasal obstruction (62.7%) and common cold (25.7%). ConclusionsIn conclusion, the study revealed that the frequency of using nasal decongestants was common (45.1%) in the study. More efforts should be paid to improve public awareness regarding indications, duration of use, and method of using nasal decongestants to avoid rebound reactions that may affect patients' daily life activities.

TI  - Hands-Up program: protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial of a combined 6-week exercise and education intervention in adults aged 50-65 with a distal radius fracture
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction This pilot study will determine the feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence for the online combined exercise and education programme (Hands-Up) compared with usual care.
   Methods and analysis The proposed randomised controlled trial will be a pilot feasibility study with a 1:1 randomisation to the Hands-Up programme or usual physical therapy. The programme setting is an online home exercise and education program. Outcome assessments will take place at the Roth|McFarlane Hand and Upper Limb Clinic in London, Ontario, which is a tertiary care academic centre. 74 people aged 50-65 years after distal radius fracture will be recruited. Purposeful recruitment will be conducted to include a sufficient number of men in the study. The Hands-Up program includes both exercise and education. Participants will engage in approximately 45 min of a full-body home exercise routine followed by 30 min of education in an online program. The educational modules will focus on fall prevention, nutrition for osteoporosis and learning about osteoporosis. Participants will engage in the program online, twice a week for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome of the study is feasibility. The study will be considered feasible if participants attend >60% of the sessions, 74 participants are enrolled in 12 months and >75% of participants attend the final study visit. For the secondary outcome, physical and self-report outcomes will be assessed.
   Ethics and discussion This study has been approved by the institutional ethics review board. The viability of an online exercise and education program for people after distal radius fracture between the ages of 50 and 65 will be evaluated in an attempt to help better prevent, diagnose and manage osteoporosis. This study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, international conferences and social media.

TI  - The prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia and the association of physical exercise with quality of life of uninvestigated dyspepsia patients in Indonesia: An internet-based survey
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB  - Background Epidemiological data on the prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia (UD) and its impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Indonesian population are still lacking. There is no study investigating the association between exercise and the HRQOL in UD patients. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of UD and its association with physical exercise, and its impact on HRQOL in Indonesian patients with UD. Methods This was a population-based, cross-sectional study, conducted using an internet-based questionnaire which was randomly distributed throughout Indonesia using the social media. The questionnaire contained socio-demographic details, exercise levels, Rome III criteria for dyspepsia, and SF-NDI (Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index). The frequency, duration, the intensity of exercise, and the classification of exercise according to ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) were included in the assessment. The screening for UD was conducted using the Rome III criteria and the SF-NDI score was calculated to assess the HRQOL in patients with UD. Results A total of 2725 valid responses were collected. The overall prevalence of UD in the study was 49.75%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that gender (female) and lack of exercise were independently associated with UD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.74-2.47, p < 0.001 and OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.42-2.07, p < 0.001). The median SF-NDI score among 1295 UD subjects in non-exercising and exercising groups was 21.00 and 18.00 (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated the prevalence of UD and the association between exercise and HRQOL among UD patients in Indonesia.

TI  - The Impact of Hypothyroidism on Satisfaction with Care and Treatment and Everyday Living: Results from E-Mode Patient Self-Assessment of Thyroid Therapy, a Cross-Sectional, International Online Patient Survey
T2  - THYROID
AB  - Background: Hypothyroid patients often report dissatisfaction and poor quality of life. This survey explored the impact of hypothyroidism on patient satisfaction, everyday living, experiences with health care professionals, and influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors.Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey targeting an international population of hypothyroid patients. Multilevel regression modeling was used for analyses.Results: The total number of responses was 3915 from 68 countries. Satisfaction with care and treatment was not associated with type of treatment for hypothyroidism. Having no confidence and trust in health care professionals was strongly associated with dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Controlling for all other variables, significant differences were found among satisfaction rates between countries. A weak inverse relationship was found between satisfaction with care and treatment and impact on everyday living (p < 0.001). Respondents taking levothyroxine (LT4) alone were more likely to report a positive impact on everyday living (pooled odds ratio 2.376 [confidence interval: 0.941-5.997]) than respondents taking liothyronine-containing treatments.Conclusions: Low levels of satisfaction with care and treatment for hypothyroidism were strongly associated with lack of confidence and trust and negative experiences with health care professionals. Differences in responses between countries were noted, implying the potential influence of national health care systems, socioeconomic and cultural factors. Contrary to widespread anecdotes in social media, this large-scale survey shows no association between type of treatment for hypothyroidism and patient satisfaction, as well as better outcomes on everyday living associated with LT4, compared with liothyronine-containing treatments.

TI  - Symptom profiles of community cases infected by influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Respiratory viruses that were suppressed through previous lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have recently started to co-circulate with SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the clinical characteristics and symptomatology of different respiratory viral infections can help address the challenges related to the identification of cases and the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variants' evolutionary patterns. Flu Watch (2006-2011) and Virus Watch (2020-2022) are household community cohort studies monitoring the epidemiology of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, in England and Wales. This study describes and compares the proportion of symptoms reported during illnesses infected by common respiratory viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 symptom profile increasingly resembles that of other respiratory viruses as new strains emerge. Increased cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing are associated with the emergence of the Omicron strains. As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, monitoring the evolution of its symptomatology associated with new variants will be critical for clinical surveillance.

TI  - UK IBD Twin Registry: Concordance and Environmental Risk Factors of Twins with IBD
T2  - DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES
AB  - Background and Aims Twin studies have long been used to infer heritability. Within the 'omics era, twin cohorts have even greater research potential. This study describes the formation of the UK IBD Twin Registry and analysis of concordance and environmental factors. Method Twin pairs with IBD were recruited by advertising via IBD charities and social media, re-tracing a dormant IBD database and clinician referral. Details of zygosity, concordance, disease history and environmental factors were assessed. Pair concordance was calculated, and environmental factors were analysed with logistic regression models adjusted for zygosity and concordance. Results Ninety-one twin pairs were included in the analysis; forty-two with CD and forty-nine with UC. More MZ twin pairs with CD were concordant compared with DZ pairs, thus inferring heritability (Chi-sq. 15.6. P < 0.001). In UC, MZ concordance was also numerically greater. Cigarette smoking was predictive of CD (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.07 P = 0.02); there may be an independent association with cannabis smoking (OR 2.59 95% CI 0.89 to 7.55 P = 0.08). Breastfeeding was protective against UC (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.93, P = 0.03), but not CD. Self-reports of less occurrences of gastroenteritis than peers were protective against future UC onset (OR 0.33 95% CI 0.15 to 0.74, P = 0.01). Method of delivery, parental attitudes towards hygiene and recall of diet did not impact future IBD concordance. Conclusions This study supports the heritability of IBD. Twin study analysis was able to elucidate environmental factors associated with IBD.

TI  - Association between Suicidal Behaviors in Adolescence and Negative Emotions, the Level of Stress, Stress Coping Strategies and the Quality of Sleep
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Suicidal behaviors in adolescents stem from complex processes deeply rooted in various spheres of life and functioning. The study was aimed at assessing the relationship between selected negative emotions, the quality of sleep, the level of perceived stress as well as stress coping strategies and suicidal ideation and attempts among high school students. The examined group consisted of adolescents aged 16-18 recruited by social-media groups in Poland. The study was based on a diagnostic survey with the application of CAWI method. The other research tools applied in the study included: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Modified, Perceived Stress Scale-10, How do you cope?-Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale as well as the authors' own questionnaire on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Anxiety, depression, aggression and insomnia as well as a high level of stress were statistically more common in girls than in boys (p < 0.001). The high level of negative emotions and insomnia, in turn, increased the risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 3.59, 95% CI: 2.13-6.06 and OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.60-3.46), as well as suicide attempts (OR = 6.29, 95% CI: 2.93-14.80 and OR = 3.29, 95% CI: 2.07-5.35). Additionally, high level of stress was associated with more than twice larger odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.13-4.63). Significantly higher prevalence of suicidal ideation (p = 0.017) and suicide attempts (p = 0.016) was observed in girls. A high level of negative emotions and stress accompanied by a low quality of sleep are factors predisposing people to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide.

TI  - Patient perspectives on the pathway to psoriatic arthritis diagnosis: results from a web-based survey of patients in the United States
T2  - BMC RHEUMATOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThere are limited real-world data on the diagnostic experiences of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), including medical care sought and potential barriers to diagnosis. We aim to describe patient experiences related to receiving a PsA diagnosis.MethodsOurs was a mixed-method, 2-phase study. Phase 1 comprised concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with clinical experts and adults diagnosed with PsA to develop a cross sectional, web-based survey. US adults with a self-reported PsA diagnosis were recruited through a patient support community (CreakyJoints), an online patient research registry (ArthritisPower), and social media outreach. In Phase 2, the online survey collected data on sociodemographics, clinical symptoms, disease burden, and diagnosis history of survey respondents with PsA.ResultsOf the 203 respondents included, 172 (84.7%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 51.6 (10.8) years. The time between seeking medical attention and receiving a diagnosis was <6months for 69 respondents, 6months to 4years for 68 respondents, and<greater than or equal to>5years for 66 respondents. Most respondents sought care from general practitioners (79.8%) and rheumatologists (66.5%). Common initial symptoms that led respondents to seek medical attention were joint pain (70.0%) and stiffness (53.7%). Among the initial symptoms that led respondents to seek care, joint pain, swollen joints, and sausage-like fingers or toes (indicating dactylitis) were more common among respondents with shorter time to diagnosis, whereas stiffness, fatigue, enthesitis (indicated by foot problems, tendon and ligament pain), and back pain were more common among respondents with longer time to diagnosis. Common misdiagnoses were psychosomatic issues (26.6%) and osteoarthritis (21.7%). Respondents with shorter times to diagnosis had lower frequencies of misdiagnosis.ConclusionsRespondents with PsA reported delays in diagnosis and misdiagnoses on their journey to a PsA diagnosis. Symptom differences, such as enthesitis and stiffness, were noted among respondents with shorter vs longer time to diagnosis. Increased understanding of diagnostic barriers may lead to earlier diagnosis and appropriate management to improve outcomes.

TI  - Risk factors for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs participating in canine agility
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - Background Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) is one of the most common causes of pelvic limb lameness in dogs. Risk factors for CCLR include breed (especially large and giant breeds), body weight, gender and spay/neuter status, and age. Few studies have evaluated physical activity and fitness indicators, however, as risk factors for disease. This study used an online questionnaire distributed primarily via social media to assess risk factors for CCLR in dogs actively engaged in agility training or competition to determine demographic and physical activity factors associated with rupture. Results Data from 260 dogs with CCLR were compared to similar data from 1006 dogs without CCLR. All dogs were actively training or competing in agility at the time of CCLR or the time of data submission, respectively. Physical characteristics associated with increased risk of CCLR included younger age, spayed female sex, greater body weight, and greater weight to height ratio. Agility activities associated with increased odds ratios included competition in events sponsored by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC), competing at novice and intermediate levels, and competing in fewer than 10 events/year. Odds ratios were lower in dogs that competed in events sponsored by United Kingdom Agility International (UKI). Other activities associated with increased odds ratio for CCLR included involvement in flyball activities and short walks or runs over hilly or flat terrain on a weekly basis. Activities associated with decreased odds ratio included involvement in dock diving, barn hunt, nosework, or lure coursing/racing activities and participation in core balance and strength exercises at least weekly. Conclusions These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that body weight and spay/neuter status are risk factors for CCLR in dogs. This is the first report to demonstrate that risk of CCLR in agility dogs is decreased in dogs that engage in regular core strengthening exercises, compete more frequently, compete at higher levels, and compete in more athletically challenging venues.

TI  - People with dyssomnia showed increased vulnerability to CoVID-19 pandemic: a questionnaire-based study exploring the patterns and predictors of sleep quality using the latent class analysis technique in Indian population
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: CoVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have impacted the sleep quality and the overall wellbeing of mankind. The present epidemiological study measured various aspects of sleep disturbance such as sleep quality, daytime impairments, negative emotionality, sleep hygiene, and well-being associated with CoVID-19 pandemic among the Indian population.
   Methods: This cross-sectional voluntary online survey (using Google form) was communicated across the country from 4th June to 3rd July 2020 through mail and social media applications. The responses received (N = 450) were categorized and validated using the latent class analysis and logistic regression tests respectively, and the classes and subclasses derived were profiled. These techniques are used for the first time in a CoVID-19 sleep study.
   Results: Out of the three classes derived from the LCA, people with severe dyssomnia belonging to class 1 (33.3%) showed high daytime impairments, negative emotionality and high vulnerability towards CoVID-19 pandemic measures. In addition, the two subclasses derived from the severe dyssomnia group; one with negative emotionality predominance and the other with excessive daytime sleepiness, were similarly affected by CoVID-19 measures. People with moderate dyssomnia (class 2, 28.5%) showed frequent arousals with daytime impairments and the majority (38.2%) which fell in to class 3, the 'no dyssomnia' category, were not impacted by CoVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusion: People with existing sleep problems or those who were vulnerable to the same were the ones affected by CoVID-19 pandemic. Those with inadequate emotional coping styles have showed heightened vulnerability. Proper medical and cognitive interventions are highly recommended for this population. No or moderate dyssomnia categories (class 3 and 2 respectively) were less impacted by CoVID-19. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Factors associated with the severity of hypertension among Malaysian adults
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - High blood pressure is a worldwide problem and major global health burden. Whether alone or combined with other metabolic diseases, high blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study is a secondary data analysis from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015, a population-based study that was conducted nationwide in Malaysia using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. A total of 15,738 adults >= 18-years-old were recruited into the study, which reports the prevalence of hypertension stages among adults in Malaysia using the JNC7 criteria and determinants of its severity. The overall prevalence of raised blood pressure was 66.8%, with 45.8% having prehypertension, 15.1% having Stage 1 hypertension, and 5.9% having Stage 2 hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, a higher likelihood of having prehypertension was observed among respondents with advancing age, males (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.41-3.12), Malay ethnicity (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.44), lower socioeconomic status, and excessive weight. The factors associated with clinical hypertension (Stages 1 and 2) were older age, rural residency (Stage 1 OR = 1.22, Stage 2 OR = 1.28), Malay ethnicity (Stage 2 OR = 1.64), diabetes (Stage 2 OR = 1.47), hypercholesterolemia (Stage 1 OR = 1.34, Stage 2 OR = 1.82), being overweight (Stage 1 OR = 2.86, Stage 2 OR = 3.44), obesity (Stage 1 OR = 9.01, Stage 2 OR = 13.72), and lower socioeconomic status. Almost 70% of Malaysian adults are at a risk of elevated blood pressure. The highest prevalence was in the prehypertension group, which clearly predicts a future incurable burden of the disease. Public health awareness, campaigns through mass and social media, and intervention in the work place should be a priority to control this epidemic.

TI  - Change in screen time and overuse, and their association with psychological well-being among US-wide school-age children during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) years 2018-21
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Previous studies on screen use and children's mental health during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic focused only on the timeframe during the pandemic, on children between narrow age ranges, only among a subset of children who have previously reported COVID-related severe family economic hardship or worries, or did not distinguish between instructive versus recreational device usage. Thus, in this study, we analyzed trends, specifically related to recreational screen use, and associations with psychological well-being (PWB) in the years before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic, among a wide range of school-aged children, widely across the nation. Methods Using the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) years 2018-21, we analyzed a large random sample of school-aged children (6-17 years old) across the US (n = 88,823). We developed PWB issue scores (PWBIS) using self-reported measures relevant to this age group, and constructed regression models to assess the magnitude of the contribution of the pandemic on recreational screen use and PWB. Results The prevalence of recreational screen overuse and PWBIS increased significantly during the pandemic, compared to prior years. We also detected a notable effect of the pandemic on increased PWBIS, as well as its interaction term finding that it strengthened the association between screen time and PWBIS (p < 0.01 across all regression models). Conclusions Accordingly, our results demonstrate the importance of the pandemic itself as an independent adverse factor and effect measure modifier for screen overuse and PWB more generally among all school-age children widely across the US. Our study used the most current data available, and future studies to evaluate whether these effects are persistent in the years after the pandemic are important.

TI  - Stay-at-home, <i>Safe at Home</i>? A survey of parental home safety practices before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: To slow the spread of COVID-19, many nonessential businesses, daycares, and schools closed, and areas imposed "stay-at-home " orders. Closures led to young children spending more time at home, traditionally, the place where more than one-half of unintentional pediatric injuries occur. The objective of the current study was to describe parental safety perceptions and confidence, safety device purchase and installation, and injury prevention practices and behaviors, in homes with children 6 years of age and younger, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a convenience sample of US participants, 18 years or older, was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021. Parents of children (<= 6 years) were recruited via social media ads and posts on Facebook and Twitter and invited to complete an anonymous, online survey about their home safety practices before and during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Upon completion, parents could participate in a prize drawing to receive one of five $100 gift cards.Results: A total of 499 participants completed the survey. Most (47.9%) were 45-54 years of age and reported the amount of time at home increased for them (93.9%) and their children (90.6%) during the stay-at-home period. Thirty-seven percent (36.9%) of parents considered their homes safe but recognized room for improvement and felt confident in their ability to make their homes safe for their children (72.8%). From the time before until the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were in place, parents increased their home injury prevention practices (42.3%). Parents that had identified unsafe areas in the home before the stay-at-home order were significantly more likely to increase their safety behaviors, take childproofing actions, and purchase or install safety devices during the stay-at-home order (p < 0.0001). Parents with younger children (5 years) were significantly more likely than parents with older children to take childproofing actions (p < .0001) including purchasing and installing safety devices (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Spending more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic may have helped the sampled parents, especially those with younger children, identify unsafe areas in their homes and encourage them to modify their behaviors, and purchase and install safety devices to help make their homes safer for their children.

TI  - Assessment of determinants and quality of life of university students with social phobias in a coastal city of south India
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Social phobia is a common psychiatric disorder, and its onset happens usually around late adolescence period. Therefore, early diagnosis and its management is essential in any educational setting.
   Objectives: To identify university students with social phobia, to find out its determinants and to observe its impact on their quality of life.
   Methods: The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Social Phobia Inventory Questionnaire and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire were used.
   Results: The mean age of the 450 student participants was 20.6 +/- 1.6 years. Majority [312(69.3%)] were males and majority [305(67.8%)] were native of urban areas. Of the total, 169(37.6%) were found to have social phobia. Among them, 114(67.5%) had mild, 47(27.8%) had moderate and 8(4.7%) had severe social phobia. Family history of anxiety disorders (P=0.006), embarrassment with own socio-economic status (P=0.001) and past history of failure in academic examinations (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the presence of social phobia among the participants. Preference of interaction using social media instead of face to face communication with people (P=0.013), and by texting rather than calling the person (P=0.002) were seen significantly more among those with social phobia. The mean quality of life scores was found to be deteriorating significantly with increasing intensity of social phobia among students (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Social phobia was seen among more than one-third of the participants. Counselling centers are therefore required to address this problem at universities. This will also help to improve the quality of life and the socializing skills of those affected.

TI  - Self-reported bio-psycho-social factors partially distinguish patellar tendinopathy from other knee problems and explain patellar tendinopathy severity in jumping athletes: A case-control study
T2  - PHYSICAL THERAPY IN SPORT
AB  - Objective: To determine what combinations of self-reported factors distinguish patellar tendinopathy (PT) from other knee problems, and explain PT severity variance.Design: Case-control study.Setting: Social media, private practice and National Health Service.Participants: An international sample of jumping athletes diagnosed with either PT (n = 132; 30.7 +/- 8.9 years; 80 males; VISA-P= 61.6 +/- 16.0) or another musculoskeletal knee condition (n = 89; 31.8 +/- 9.9 years; 47 males; VISA-P= 62.9 +/- 21.2) by a clinician in the last 6 months.Main outcome measures: We considered clinical diagnosis (case = having PT vs control = having other knee problems) as the dependent variable. Severity and sporting impact were defined by VISA-P and availability, respectively.Results: A model comprising seven factors distinguished PT from other knee problems; training duration (OR = 1.10), sport type (OR = 2.31), injured side (OR = 2.28), pain onset (OR = 1.97), morning pain (OR = 1.89), condition acceptability (OR = 0.39) and swelling (OR = 0.37). Sports-specific function (OR = 1.02) and player level (OR = 4.11) explained sporting availability. 44% of PT severity variance was explained by quality of life (0 = 0.32), sports-specific function (0 = 0.38) and age (0 =-0.17).Conclusion: Sports-specific, biomedical and psychological factors partially distinguish PT from other knee problems. Availability is mainly explained by sports-specific factors, while psychosocial factors impact on severity. Adding sports-specific and bio-psycho-social factors into assessments could help better iden-tification and management of jumping athletes with PT.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Restricted fluid bolus versus current practice in children with septic shock: the FiSh feasibility study and pilot RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: There has been no randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fluid bolus therapy in paediatric sepsis in the developed world despite evidence that excess fluid may be associated with harm.
   Objectives: To determine the feasibility of the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) trial - a RCT comparing restricted fluid bolus (10 ml/kg) with current practice (20 ml/kg) in children with septic shock in the UK.
   Design: (1) Qualitative feasibility study exploring parents' views about the pilot RCT. (2) Pilot RCT over a 9-month period, including integrated parental and staff perspectives study.
   Setting: (1) Recruitment took place across four NHS hospitals in England and on social media. (2) Recruitment took place across 13 NHS hospitals in England.
   Participants: (1) Parents of children admitted to a UK hospital with presumed septic shock in the previous 3 years. (2) Children presenting to an emergency department with clinical suspicion of infection and shock after 20 ml/kg of fluid. Exclusion criteria were receipt of > 20 ml/kg of fluid, conditions requiring fluid restriction and the patient not for full active treatment (i.e. palliative care plan in place). Site staff and parents of children in the pilot were recruited to the perspectives study.
   Interventions: (1) None. (2) Children were randomly allocated (1 : 1) to 10-or 20-ml/kg fluid boluses every 15 minutes for 4 hours if in shock.
   Main outcome measures: (1) Acceptability of FiSh trial, proposed consent model and potential outcome measures. (2) Outcomes were based on progression criteria, including recruitment and retention rates, protocol adherence and separation between the groups, and collection and distribution of potential outcome measures.
   Results: (1) Twenty-one parents were interviewed. All would have consented for the pilot study. (2) Seventy-five children were randomised, 40 to the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and 35 to the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group. Two children were withdrawn. Although the anticipated recruitment rate was achieved, there was variability across the sites. Fifty-nine per cent of children in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and 74% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group required only a single trial bolus before shock resolved. The volume of fluid (in ml/kg) was 35% lower in the first hour and 44% lower over the 4-hour period in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group. Fluid boluses were delivered per protocol (volume and timing) for 79% of participants in the 10-ml/kg fluid bolus group and for 55% in the 20-ml/kg fluid bolus group, mainly as a result of delivery not being completed within 15 minutes. There were no deaths. Length of hospital stay, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfers, and days alive and PICU free did not differ significantly between the groups. Two adverse events were reported in each group. A questionnaire was completed by 45 parents, 20 families and seven staff were interviewed and 20 staff participated in focus groups. Although a minority of site staff lacked equipoise in favour of more restricted boluses, all supported the trial.
   Conclusions: Even though a successful feasibility and pilot RCT were conducted, participants were not as unwell as expected. A larger trial is not feasible in its current design in the UK.
   Future work: Further observational work is required to determine the epidemiology of severe childhood infection in the UK in the postvaccine era.

TI  - Protocol for validation of the 4AT, a rapid screening tool for delirium: a multicentre prospective diagnostic test accuracy study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome of rapid onset, commonly precipitated by acute illness. It is common in older people in the emergency department (ED) and acute hospital, but greatly under-recognised in these and other settings. Delirium and other forms of cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, commonly coexist. There is a need for a rapid delirium screening tool that can be administered by a range of professional-level healthcare staff to patients with sensory or functional impairments in a busy clinical environment, which also incorporates general cognitive assessment. We developed the 4 'A's Test (4AT) for this purpose. This study's primary objective is to validate the 4AT against a reference standard. Secondary objectives include (1) comparing the 4AT with another widely used test (the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)); (2) determining if the 4AT is sensitive to general cognitive impairment; (3) assessing if 4AT scores predict outcomes, including (4) a health economic analysis.
   Methods and analysis 900 patients aged 70 or over in EDs or acute general medical wards will be recruited in three sites (Edinburgh, Bradford and Sheffield) over 18 months. Each patient will undergo a reference standard delirium assessment and will be randomised to assessment with either the 4AT or the CAM. At 12 weeks, outcomes (length of stay, institutionalisation and mortality) and resource utilisation will be collected by a questionnaire and via the electronic patient record.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted in Scotland and England. The study involves administering tests commonly used in clinical practice. The main ethical issues are the essential recruitment of people without capacity. Dissemination is planned via publication in high impact journals, presentation at conferences, social media and the website www.the4AT.com.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of Health Care Workers about Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background and Objectives: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency. Health Care Workers (HCWs) with sound knowledge and practices can help curb the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of HCWs about COVID-19 and compare physicians and non-physicians in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted among HCWs in Saudi Arabia in March and April 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire having four sections including; socio-demographic and professional profile, knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19. Questionnaire link was sent through social media. Descriptive analysis was used for assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice and Chi-square test was used for comparing physicians and non-physicians. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0.
   Results: A total of 398 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Only 45% of the participants had correct knowledge about the agent while about 97% knew that close contact with infected person is the most important risk factor. Only 63% had correct knowledge about the role of antibiotics in COVID-19 treatment. Majority of the HCWs were worried and most frequently reported worry was risk to family. Carrying infection to home was most commonly reported fear, 92%. Cleaning hands often or always was 11.5% and 87% respectively. About 71% wore mask during work. Knowledge was better among physicians compared to non-physicians while attitude and practices were comparable between the two groups.
   Conclusion: We found that there was poor knowledge about causative agent and role of antibiotics for COVID-19 but for mode of transmission and prevention there was good knowledge. There were widely prevalent worries and fears among the participants. Overall, there were good infection control practices among the HCWs. Interventions are needed to improve knowledge and address worries and fears of HCW. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press International B.V.

TI  - Using Digital Tools to Study the Health of Adults Born Preterm at a Large Scale: e-Cohort Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Preterm birth is a global health concern. Its adverse consequences may persist throughout the life course, exerting a potentially heavy burden on families, health systems, and societies. In high-income countries, the first children who benefited from improved care are now adults entering middle age. However, there is a clear gap in the knowledge regarding the long-term outcomes of individuals born preterm.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting and following up an e-cohort of adults born preterm worldwide and provide estimations of participation, characteristics of participants, the acceptability of questions, and the quality of data collected.
   Methods: We implemented a prospective, open, observational, and international e-cohort pilot study (Health of Adult People Born Preterm-an e-Cohort Pilot Study [HAPP-e]). Inclusion criteria were being an adult (aged =18 years), born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), having internet access and an email address, and understanding at least 1 of the available languages. A large, multifaceted, and multilingual communication strategy was established. Between December 2019 and June 2021, inclusion and repeated data collection were performed using a secured web platform. We provided descriptive statistics regarding participation in the e-cohort, namely, the number of persons who registered on the platform, signed the consent form, initiated and completed the baseline questionnaire, and initiated and completed the follow-up questionnaire. We also described the main characteristics of the HAPP-e participants and provided an assessment of the quality of the data and the acceptability of sensitive questions.
   Results: As of December 31, 2020, a total of 1004 persons had registered on the platform, leading to 527 accounts with a confirmed email and 333 signed consent forms. A total of 333 participants initiated the baseline questionnaire. All participants were invited to follow-up, and 35.7% (119/333) consented to participate, of whom 97.5% (116/119) initiated the follow-up questionnaire. Completion rates were very high both at baseline (296/333, 88.9%) and at follow-up (112/116, 96.6%). This sample of adults born preterm in 34 countries covered a wide range of sociodemographic and health characteristics. The gestational age at birth ranged from 23+6 to 36+6 weeks (median 32, IQR 29-35 weeks). Only 2.1% (7/333) of the participants had previously participated in a cohort of individuals born preterm. Women (252/333, 75.7%) and highly educated participants (235/327, 71.9%) were also overrepresented. Good quality data were collected thanks to validation controls implemented on the web platform. The acceptability of potentially sensitive questions was excellent, as very few participants chose the "I prefer not to say" option when available.
   Conclusions: Although we identified room for improvement in specific procedures, this pilot study confirmed the great potential for recruiting a large and diverse sample of adults born preterm worldwide, thereby advancing research on adults born preterm.

TI  - Fibromyalgia syndrome in medical students
T2  - EGYPTIAN RHEUMATOLOGIST
AB  - Aim of the work: To investigate the frequency of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) among medical students and its stratifications. Patients and methods: The work included 513 medical students from Kafrelsheikh University. The 2010 and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) fibromyalgia classification criteria were used to determine the presence of FMS. The chronic pain grade questionnaire was used to assess pain severity and impact on daily activities, recreational, social and family activities, and ability to work. Results: The students were 296 females (57.7 %) and 217 males (42.3 %). 64 (12.5 %) fulfilled the 2010 criteria (F:M 2.8:1) (p = 0.015). The frequency of female affection was 15.9 % (47/296) compared to 7.83 % (17/217) in male. 37 (7.2 %) fulfilled 2016 criteria and only six cases (9.3 %) were known to have FMS. The frequency of FMS in students of the first 3 years (basic science) and the following 3 years (clinical) was 14.1 % and 9.5 %, respectively. Considering the chronic pain grade, there was a significant difference (p < 0.0001) in all pain items, daily recreational, social, family activities, and ability to work between those with and without FMS. 213 (41.5 %) had knowledge about FMS and the source of their information was from social media (39.4 %), their academic study (26.8 %), web pages (25.4 %) and friends (8.5 %). Conclusion: Fibromyalgia is highly frequent among medical students, especially females of basic years with a high impact on recreational, social, family activities, and ability to work. Medical students should be considered a "high-risk" group for FMS and should be educated about it and managed accordingly. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Evaluation of medication adherence among patients with chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB  - Background Medication adherence in chronic diseases patients is a worldwide concern. Not achieving the goal of treatments because of non-adherence will lead to more complications and eventually may lead to death. In Saudi Arabia, we have insufficient data for interpretation. Hence, this study aims to have a better perspective at the number of the non-adherent patients with chronic diseases to their medications and its associated factors.
   Material and Method Cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among chronic diseases patients living in Saudi Arabia throughout social media and hospital visits from August 2018 to April 2019. A three-section questionnaire consists of patient's health, medications and adherence characteristics. Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS) was used to identify the level of adherence among chronic diseases patients. Univariate descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test with one-way ANOVA were used as bivariate analysis. Finally, significant predictors of medical adherence with adjusted coefficient were determined by multivariable linear regression.
   Results A total of 385 patients were included in the analysis for the current study. Overall, 96.62% (n = 372) were non-adherent to their medications according to ARMS scale. Multiple linear regression model found types of co-morbidities, medication dosage form and dosage regimen to be independent predictors of medical adherence.
   Conclusion Medication adherence is alarmingly low among chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. There is a clear need for in-depth understanding for barriers. It is therefore important to conduct a qualitative study.
   What's newWhat's known
   Medication adherence is a critical factor in treatment success. Low adherence to the medication is a common problem among chronic disease patients. Moreover, the majority of the studies in Saudi Arabia showed low adherence rate, and it focused in one single chronic disease only despite that patient may have more.
   Most patients had more than one single chronic disease, so this study aims to take a snapshot to capture the adherence rate among patients who are suffering from chronic disease Saudi Arabia and its associated factors. This can help in understanding medication adherence behavior in clinical practice.

TI  - Protocol for a 2-year longitudinal study of eating disturbances, mental health problems and overuse injuries in rock climbers (CLIMB)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Rock climbing is a rapidly growing sport in which performance may be affected by participant's weight and leanness, and there may be pressure on athletes with respect to their eating behaviour and body weight. However, there is sparse research performed on climbers, constituting a knowledge gap which the present study aims to fill. The primary outcomes of the study are to examine disordered eating and overuse injuries in rock climbers. Secondary variables are body image, indicators of relative energy deficiency, mental health problems, compulsive training, perfectionism, sleep quality and bone density.Method and analysis This prospective longitudinal study aims to recruit Swedish competitive rock climbers (>13 years) via the Swedish Climbing Federation. A non-athlete control group will be recruited via social media (n=equal of the climbing group). Data will be collected using streamlined validated web-based questionnaires with three follow-ups over 2 years. Inclusion criteria for rock climbers will be a minimum advanced level according to International Rock-Climbing Research Association. The non-athlete control group is matched for age and gender. Exclusion criteria are having competed at an elite level in any sport as well as training more often than twice per week. Statistical analyses will include multinominal logistic regression, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). We will assess effect measure modification when relevant and conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of lost to follow-up.Ethics and dissemination The Rock-Climbers' Longitudinal attitudes towards Injuries, Mental health and Body image study, CLIMB, was approved by the Swedish ethics authority (2021-05557-01). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed research papers, reports, research conferences, student theses and stakeholder communications.

TI  - Public Knowledge, Practice, and Attitude Regarding Cancer Screening: A Community-Based Study in Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - (1) Background: Cancer screening tests discover cancer at early stages, even before symptoms appear. When abnormal tissues or a malignant mass is found early, treatment and cure rates are improved. In late stages, the cancer may have grown and metastasized. This can negatively affect cancer treatment and reduce the overall survival rate. Screening tests are performed when a person is asymptomatic. Public awareness about cancer screening is crucial for the success of cancer screening programs and for consequently decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate due to cancer. (2) Aim: Assess the knowledge and perception of the community regarding cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. (3) Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study targeting the general population of Saudi Arabia was conducted from January to June 2022. The data were collected using a structured validated electronic questionnaire. The study questionnaire covered participants' personal data, medical history, source of data, and participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice items. The questionnaire was used as a digital survey and was distributed electronically to the target population. (4) Results: A total of 1313 participants completed the study questionnaire. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 67 years, with a mean age of 28.3 +/- 11.4 years old. Overall, 60.4% of the study participants knew about cancer screening. Regarding the benefits of cancer screening, 91.8% of the participants reported knowing that the early detection of cancer helps treatment, and 81.1% knew that the early detection of cancer improves treatment outcomes. Moreover, 441 (33.6%) of the participants had good knowledge regarding cancer and cancer screening, while 872 (66.4%) had poor levels of knowledge. Furthermore, 106 (8.1%) of the participants underwent cancer screening. (5) Conclusions: The study results revealed that participants' awareness regarding cancer and cancer screening was low, especially for approaches to reduce cancer risk. Additionally, the study participants' practice regarding cancer screening was low. The health care authority should plan for population-based efficacious cancer screening programs. In addition, cancer screening information and the benefits of early detection can be disseminated through social media to target the desired populations.

A1  - MUNCO Registry
TI  - Factors Associated with Mortality in Coronavirus-Associated Mucormycosis: Results from Mycotic Infections in COVID-19 (MUNCO) Online Registry
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. MUNCO is an international database used to collect clinical data on cases of CAM in real time. Preliminary data from the Mycotic Infections in COVID-19 (MUNCO) online registry yielded 728 cases from May to September 2021 in four South Asian countries and the United States. A majority of the cases (694; 97.6%) consisted of a mucormycosis infection. The dataset allowed for the analysis of the risk factors for adverse outcomes from CAM and this analysis is presented in this paper. Methods: The submission of cases was aided by a direct solicitation and social media online. The primary endpoints were full recovery or death measured on day 42 of the diagnosis. All patients had histopathologically confirmed CAM. The groups were compared to determine the contribution of each patient characteristic to the outcome. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to model the probability of death after a CAM diagnosis. Results: The registry captured 694 cases of CAM. Within this, 341 could be analyzed as the study excluded patients with an unknown CAM recovery status due to either an interruption or a lack of follow up. The 341 viable cases consisted of 258 patients who survived after the completion of treatment and 83 patients who died during the period of observation. In a multivariable logistic regression model, the factors associated with an increased risk of mortality include old age (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, p = 0.001), history of diabetes mellitus (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.01-11.9, p = 0.02) and a lower BMI (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, p = 0.03). Mucor localized to sinus disease was associated with 77% reduced odds of death (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.57, p = 0.001), while cerebral mucor was associated with an increased odds of death (OR = 10.96, 95% CI 4.93-24.36, p = <= 0.0001). Conclusion: In patients with CAM, older age, a history of diabetes and a lower body mass index is associated with increased mortality. Disease limited to the sinuses without a cerebral extension is associated with a lower risk of mortality. Interestingly, the use of zinc and azithromycin were not associated with increased mortality in our study.

TI  - Understandability and Actionability of Audiovisual Patient Education on Epinephrine Auto-Injector
T2  - ASTHMA ALLERGY IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The internet and social media, which have become a part of daily life, have also become critical sources for obtaining health information. Anyone can upload videos on any topic on Youtube; however, Youtube does not guarantee that the uploaded videos contain the correct information. Failure to use or the misuse of epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs) can lead to fatal results. The aim of this study was analyze the reliability, understandability, and actionability of the videos on the use of epinephrine auto-injectors published on Youtube.Materials and Methods: The search term 'how to use epinephrine auto-injectors' was searched on YouTubeTM (http://www.youtube. com) on 04.10.2022 and the first 200 videos were reviewed. Information about the video was recorded and the Global Quality Scale (GQS), DISCERN (DISCERN is a brief questionnaire that provides users with a valid and reliable way of assessing the quality of written information on treatment choices for a health problem) and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) were evaluated.Results: Of the 112 videos, 86.6% of those included in the study were educational for the public. The duration of understandable videos was found to be significantly higher than non-understandable videos (p<0.001). A moderately positive correlation was found between the GQS scores and understandability scores (p<0.001) and between actionability scores (p<0.001). A moderately positive correlation was found between the DISCERN scores and understandability (p<0.001) and actionability scores (p<0.001). The understandability rate of the videos uploaded by physicians and non-physician health workers was found to be significantly lower than the other video uploaders (p<0.01). In the performed linear regression analysis, it was seen that the number of understandable videos published by physicians and non-physician healthcare professionals was significantly lower than the videos uploaded by other users. The number of understandable videos was significantly higher in long videos.Conclusion: There are severe problems regarding the videos' quality, reliability, understandability and actionability. It is thought that Youtube content on the use of EAIs in case of anaphylaxis should be improved.

TI  - A descriptive study on Bulgarian preclinical dental students' knowledge and attitude towards coronavirus disease 2019 precautions and cross-infection control practices
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL HEALTH AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: One year after the novel coronavirus pandemic, there is a sustained risk of further global spread and most countries continue to impose preventive measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current situation outlined a specific reformulation of dental education in Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria - initial transition of face-to-face classes towards electronic learning (e-learning) processes, and subsequently, a transition from online teaching toward hybrid education. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate preclinical dental students' knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 precautions as well as crossinfection control strategies.
   METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted online on 258 out of 516 preclinical dental students at the School of Dental Medicine, Sofia, using a self-administered questionnaire. Survey items were grouped in 3 general sections: educational experiences, students' knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 precautions and sources of relevant information as well as students' personal experiences during the current pandemic.
   RESULTS: A total of 169 students participated in the study (response rate: 65.5%). Of them, 98 (57.9%) were secondyear students, 42.6% were men, and their mean age was 21 +/- 1 years. Almost one-third of the participants indicated violation of disinfection and sterilization protocols (28.9%) and the presence of aerosol-generating procedures (27.2%) as the most important COVID-19 predisposing factors in dental practice. Vaccination was suggested as the most effective way of prevention against the COVID-19. Proposed infection control practices included strict cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization (87.6%), personal protective equipment (PPE) (85.8%), frequent ventilation (53.3%), and treatment after a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (or other) test (46.2%). Social media was considered as the main source for pandemic-related information (68.0%).
   CONCLUSION: In the light of COVID-19, dental students demonstrated a satisfactory level of knowledge regarding standard precautions in dental practice; however, more attention should be paid to additional transmission-based precautions to ensure the safety of educational and working environment.

TI  - Patients' Willingness and Perspectives Toward Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Regulatory Cell Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
T2  - CROHNS & COLITIS 360
AB  - Background: Inflammatory bowel disease is a life-changing disease resulting from recurrent intestinal inflammation. Current therapies (eg, steroids and biologics) are associated with mild to severe side effects, and none provide a cure. Recent research has focused on genetically engineering gut-specific anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells (CAR-Tregs) to control intestinal inflammation, a logistically and conceptually complex approach. The purpose of our study was to understand patients' willingness to try CAR-Treg given 2 hypothetical scenarios-in a clinical trial or as a new treatment.
   Methods: We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about their willingness to try CAR-Treg. The online survey was developed using patient focus groups and associated literature. We recruited participants through email and social media. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze closed-ended questions and inductive thematic analysis to analyze open-ended follow-up questions.
   Results: Survey participants indicated high willingness to try CAR-Treg therapy in both a clinical trial and as a new treatment. Willingness to try was not correlated with disease state or medication history. Women were less likely than men to indicate willingness to participate in a clinical trial. Participants' reasons for being willing to try CAR-Treg therapy included the wish to change their current treatment and the calling to participate in research. Participants that were not willing to try CAR-Treg mentioned the lack of long-term data and the success of their current therapy.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to investigate patient willingness to try CAR-Treg therapy. Our results demonstrate the promise of moving this therapy into clinical practice as most patients indicated willingness to try.
   Lay Summary
   We surveyed people living with inflammatory bowel disease about their willingness to try a new therapeutic approach currently developed in several research laboratories-chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T-regulatory cells-and found high willingness to try, independent of disease state or medication history.

TI  - Effect of visual presentation of atherosclerotic carotid plaque on adherence to secondary preventive therapy using mHealth technologies<i> (PreventiPlaque</i> app): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death worldwide. Although knowledge regarding diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically, secondary prevention remains insufficiently implemented due to failure among affected individuals to adhere to guideline recommendations. This has continued to lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Involving patients in their healthcare and facilitating their active roles in their chronic disease management is an opportunity to meet the needs of the increasing number of cardiovascular patients. However, simple recall of advice regarding a more preventive lifestyle does not affect sustainable behavioral lifestyle changes. We investigate the effect of plaque visualization combined with low-threshold daily lifestyle tasks using the smartphone app PreventiPlaque to evaluate change in cardiovascular risk profile.Methods: and study design: This randomized, controlled clinical trial includes 240 participants with ultrasound evidence of atherosclerotic plaque in one or both carotid arteries, defined as focal thickening of the vessel wall measuring 50% more than the regular vessel wall. A criterion for participation is access to a smartphone suitable for app usage. The participants are randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. While both groups receive the standard of care, the intervention group has additional access to the PreventiPlaque app during the 12-month follow-up. The app includes daily tasks that promote a healthier lifestyle in the areas of smoking cessation, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet. The impact of plaque visualization and app use on the change in cardiovascular risk profile is assessed by SCORE2. Feasibility and effectiveness of the PreventiPlaque app are evaluated using standardized and validated measures for patient feedback. Ethics and dissemination: This clinical trial is approved by the ethics committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany). Study results will be disseminated at conferences and in peer -reviewed journals. Information regarding the PreventiPlaque app is available via print media, social media channels, and on the authors' websites.

TI  - Knowledge and attitude on prevention of COVID-19 among community health workers in Nepal-a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundEmerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for public health and the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019is a reemerging case of an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corornavirus-2. Health care worker worldwide are at higher risk worldwide and the situation is the same in Nepal. The knowledge and attitude of health workers will certainly mark the outcome towards this pandemic. So, this study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of community health workers towards the prevention of COVID-19 virus.MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among the community health workers of various provinces of Nepal. A semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire was prepared in Google form and circulated to the sampled health workers through various social media platforms like face book, messenger, Instagram and g-mails. A total of 650 invitations were send and among them 420 responded and among them only 399 provided complete response. Responses containing anonymized data was collected analyzed in using SPSS-version-20. The results were interpreted and was checked with various demographic and enabling factors using chi-square test and logistic regression model. Also, ethical approval was taken from NHRC (Nepal Health Research Council (protocol registration number: 360/2020P) prior to the conduction of study.ResultsOut the total sample size of 450, we took 399 responses taking into consideration all the inclusion criteria. So, from 399 valid response, 230 (47.6%) were males and 169 (42.4%) were females. 380 (95.2%) employed participants thought that wearing PPE will reduce the chances of getting COVID-19, majority of the participants 80.5% (321) responded that COVID-19 will successfully be controlled and staffs receiving excellent support from palika had high knowledge level. Knowledge level was significantly associated with the enabling factor "support from palika" (P =0.045).45.9% of the respondents had no availability of COVID-19 response medical items for prevention of COVID-19 at their respective health facilities. Also the logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of knowledge level was 2 times higher (AOR=1.913 at 95% CI: 1.266-2.891) compared to the female participants (Ref- female).ConclusionsProper and adequate knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 is a paramount in the prevention and control of SARS-COV-2. Health care workers are knowledgeable about COVID-19 and are proactively practicing the preventive measures to minimize the spread of infection but some lack optimistic attitude. Hence, the constantly updated educational programs related to COVID-19 will surely contribute to improving the healthcare workers knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19.

TI  - Promoting 'testicular awareness': Co-design of an inclusive campaign using the World Café Methodology
T2  - HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
AB  - Introduction: Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged 15-44 years in many countries. Most men with testicular cancer present with a lump. Testicular symptoms are more likely to occur secondary to benign diseases like epididymo-orchitis, a common sexually transmitted infection. Gender and sexual minorities are at an increased risk of testicular diseases and health disparities. The aim of this study was to co-design an inclusive community-based campaign to promote testicular awareness.Methods: This study uses the World Cafe methodology. Participation was sought from Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ friendly organisations, testicular cancer survivors, health policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic designers. Participants engaged in three rounds of conversations to co-design the campaign. Data were collected using drawing sheets, artefact cards, sticky notes, coloured markers and a voice recorder. Deductive thematic analysis was conducted.Results: Seventeen individuals participated in the study. Six themes emerged from the analysis as follows: (i) online communication; (ii) offline communication; (iii) behavioural targeting and education; (iv) campaign frequency and reach; (v) demographic segmentation; and (vi) campaign identity. The use of social media for campaign delivery featured strongly in all conversations. Participants also recommended offline communication using posters and radio/television advertisements to scale up the campaign and achieve wider reach. Advertisements to overcome embarrassment surrounding testicular health were particularly recommended. Participants emphasised that campaign delivery must be dynamic whilst ensuring that the health-promoting messages are not diluted or lost. They stressed the importance of being inclusive and tailoring the campaign to different age groups, gender identities and sexual orientations.Conclusions: Study recommendations will be used to design and deliver the campaign. Future research will be needed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, cost and effect of the campaign on promoting testicular awareness and early detection of testicular diseases.Patient or Public Contribution: A participatory research approach was used to co-design the campaign with members of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ (LGBTQ+) friendly organisations, LGBTQ+ student bodies, LGBTQ+ staff networks, LGBTQ+ sports clubs, men's health organisations, testicular cancer survivors, health policy makers, media and marketing experts and graphic designers.

TI  - Individuals with currently untreated mental illness: causal beliefs and readiness to seek help
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
AB  - Aims. Many people with mental illness do not seek professional help. Beliefs about the causes of their current health problem seem relevant for initiating treatment. Our aim was to find out to what extent the perceived causes of current untreated mental health problems determine whether a person considers herself/himself as having a mental illness, perceives need for professional help and plans to seek help in the near future.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we examined 207 untreated persons with a depressive syndrome, all fulfilling criteria for a current mental illness as confirmed with a structured diagnostic interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The sample was recruited in the community using adverts, flyers and social media. We elicited causal explanations for the present problem, depression literacy, self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need for professional help, help-seeking intentions, severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression), and whether respondents had previously sought mental healthcare.
   Results. Most participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder (n = 181, 87.4%) and/or neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 120, 58.0%) according to the ICD-10. N = 94 (45.4%) participants had never received mental health treatment previously. Exploratory factor analysis of a list of 25 different causal explanations resulted in five factors: biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma, current stress and unhealthy behaviour. Attributing the present problem to biomedical causes, person-related causes, childhood trauma and stress were all associated with stronger self-identification as having a mental illness. In persons who had never received mental health treatment previously, attribution to biomedical causes was related to greater perceived need and stronger help-seeking intentions. In those with treatment experience, lower attribution to person-related causes and stress were related to greater perceived need for professional help.
   Conclusions. While several causal explanations are associated with self-identification as having a mental illness, only biomedical attributions seem to be related to increase perceived need and help-seeking intentions, especially in individuals with no treatment experiences. Longitudinal studies investigating causal beliefs and help-seeking are needed to find out how causal attributions guide help-seeking behaviour. From this study it seems possible that portraying professional mental health treatment as not being restricted to biomedical problems would contribute to closing the treatment gap for mental disorders.

TI  - Exploring Abnormal Behavior Patterns of Online Users With Emotional Eating Behavior: Topic Modeling Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Emotional eating (EE) is one of the most significant symptoms of various eating disorders. It has been difficult to collect a large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies of this symptom have been conducted. To provide adequate support for online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system (PSS).
   Objective: This study aimed to analyze the behavior patterns of emotional eaters as the first step to designing a personalized intervention system.
   Methods: The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze behavioral data on EE. Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit, were analyzed. This dataset included all posts and feedback from July 2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. In addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated. Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of 90.64% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users with EE behaviors. The expert group that labeled the dataset to train the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. The experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0). Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA.
   Results: The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic: addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. The 5 main topics of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation, automatic bot feedback, and health information. The feedback topic distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior (overall P<.001).
   Conclusions: This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors. We discovered the possibility of the LDA topic model as an exploratory user study method for abnormal behaviors in medical research. We also investigated the possibilities of ML- and topic modeling-based classifiers to automatically categorize text-based behavioral data, which could be applied to personalized medicine in future research.

TI  - Relative Validity and Reproducibility of a New 44-Item Diet and Food Frequency Questionnaire Among Adults: Online Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Dietary questionnaires currently available which can assess the habitual diet are timely, costly, or not adapted well to the modern diet; thus, there is a need for a shorter food frequency e-Questionnaire (FFeQ) adapted to Western diets, in order to properly estimate energy and macronutrient intakes or rank individuals according to food and nutrient intakes. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative validity and reproducibility of a 30-minute and 44-item FFeQ in a sample of adults obtained from the general population.
   Methods: A sample of French adults was recruited through social media and an advertising campaign. A total of 223 volunteers completed the FFeQ twice at one-year intervals and were included in the reproducibility study. During that interval, 92 participants completed three-to-six 24-hour recalls and were included in the validity study. Nutrient and dietary intakes were computed for all validity and reproducibility participants. The level of agreement between the two methods was evaluated for nutrient and food group intakes using classification into quintiles of daily intake, correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots.
   Results: For relative validity, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.09 to 0.88 (unadjusted correlation coefficients, median: 0.48) and 0.02 to 0.68 (deattenuated and energy adjusted correlation coefficients, median: 0.50) for food group and nutrient intakes, respectively. The median proportion of subjects classified into the same or adjacent quintile was 73% and 66% for food and nutrient intakes, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement across the range of intakes. Regarding reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.33 to 0.72 (median: 0.60) and 0.55 to 0.73 (median: 0.64), for food and nutrient intakes, respectively.
   Conclusions: The FFeQ showed acceptable validity and reproducibility in a sample of adults based on their food and nutrient intakes. The FFeQ is a promising and low-cost tool that can be used in large-scale online epidemiological studies or clinical routines and could be integrated into evidence-based smartphone apps for assessing diet components.

TI  - Children's mobile-gaming preferences, online risks, and mental health
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study examined the relationships between children's mobile gaming preferences, online risks, and mental health. Data were obtained from a sample of 2,702 third and fourth grade students from 16 elementary schools in Taiwan and 9 schools in China. A self-administered questionnaire was used. The mental state of the children who participated in the study was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), while mobile gaming addiction was assessed using the short form of the Internet Gaming Disorders Scale (IGDS9-SF). The results showed that about 54% of children played mobile games with others (multi-player), while 31% played mobile games alone, and 15% did not play mobile games. Multiple logistic regression results indicated that behaviors such as participating in multi-player games, playing violent games, a poor parent-child relationship, and living in a rural area were associated with a greater risk of mobile gaming addiction. Involvement in multi-player games, playing violent games, mobile gaming addiction, and exposure to mobile violence/pornography were associated with greater risks of cyber aggression/victimization. Multiple regression results showed that being a multi-player, playing violent games, mobile gaming addiction, exposure to violence/pornography, exposure to cyber aggression/victimization, and having a poor parent-child relationship were associated with emotional and behavioral problems.

TI  - Awareness and Attitude Toward Refractive Error Surgery and Other Correction Methods in Aseer Region, Saudi Arabia: A Cross Sectional Study
T2  - BAHRAIN MEDICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO), reported that the most frequent vision problem is refractive error. It is experienced when the shape of the eye keeps light from focusing correctly on the retina. Refractive error proves to be a significant health issue as it is the most common cause of visual deterioration and the second leading cause of vision-loss internationally. There are many treatment modalities with public different preferences. Aim: to assess the awareness and attitude of the population with refractive error toward refractive correction methods particularly surgical procedures in Aseer region, Southern of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study targeting general population who lives in Asser region with refractive error. Data were collected using pre-structured electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire was used as a digital survey and distributed to all participants in a private and anonymous manner. Question was designed to elicit information in concise and objective manner. In addition, logics were used in the question so the subsequent answer would base on prior response. Final questionnaire was uploaded online using social media platforms. Results: A total of 402 participants with refractive errors completed the study questionnaire. Participants' ages ranged from 16 to 70 years with mean age of 30.1 +/- 12.9 years old. The most reported refractive error type was myopia (61.9%) followed by astigmatism (23.6%), and hyperopia (14.4%). The most reported refractive error corrective method was spectacles (72.4%), followed by refractive surgery (16.2%), spectacles with lenses (9.2%), and only lenses (2.2%). Exact of 239 (59.5%) of the study participants were aware of the surgical procedure for refractive error correction while a total of 118 (29.4%) of the study participants expect refractive surgeries to be dangerous. Conclusions: In conclusion, the current study revealed that myopia was the most reported refractive error and spectacles was the most used corrective method followed by surgery. Cosmetic issue with complications (eye infections) were the main factors behind refusing non-surgical modalities. Also, participants showed considerable awareness regarding surgical procedure and the attitude towards surgical approaches was not bad where vast majority think it is not dangerous.

TI  - Identifying and Understanding Communities Using Twitter to Connect About Depression: Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Depression is the leading cause of diseases globally and is often characterized by a lack of social connection. With the rise of social media, it is seen that Twitter users are seeking Web-based connections for depression.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify communities where Twitter users tweeted using the hashtag #MyDepressionLooksLike to connect about depression. Once identified, we wanted to understand which community characteristics correlated to Twitter users turning to a Web-based community to connect about depression.
   Methods: Tweets were collected using NCapture software from May 25 to June 1, 2016 during the Mental Health Month (n=104) in the northeastern United States and Washington DC. After mapping tweets, we used a Poisson multilevel regression model to predict tweets per community (county) offset by the population and adjusted for percent female, percent population aged 15-44 years, percent white, percent below poverty, and percent single-person households. We then compared predicted versus observed counts and calculated tweeting index values (TIVs) to represent undertweeting and overtweeting. Last, we examined trends in community characteristics by TIV using Pearson correlation.
   Results: We found significant associations between tweet counts and area-level proportions of females, single-person households, and population aged 15-44 years. TIVs were lower than expected (TIV 1) in eastern, seaboard areas of the study region. There were communities tweeting as expected in the western, inland areas (TIV 2). Counties tweeting more than expected were generally scattered throughout the study region with a small cluster at the base of Maine. When examining community characteristics and overtweeting and undertweeting by county, we observed a clear upward gradient in several types of nonprofits and TIV values. However, we also observed U-shaped relationships for many community factors, suggesting that the same characteristics were correlated with both overtweeting and undertweeting.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Web-based communities, rather than replacing physical connection, may complement or serve as proxies for offline social communities, as seen through the consistent correlations between higher levels of tweeting and abundant nonprofits. Future research could expand the spatiotemporal scope to confirm these findings.

TI  - Handling Web Bias 2019 Chairs' Welcome and Workshop Summary
T2  - COMPANION OF THE 11TH ACM CONFERENCE ON WEB SCIENCE (WEBSCI' 19)
CP  - 11th ACM Conference on Web Science (WebSci)
AB  - A key aspect of the Web Science conference is exploring the ethical challenges of technologies, data, algorithms, platforms, and people in the Web as well as detecting, preventing and predicting anomalies in web data including algorithmic and data biases. Handling Web Bias (HWB) is a new workshop focusing on best practices for identifying and handling web bias. Awareness of the problems of algorithmic and data bias has been growing but even with careful review of the algorithms and data sets, it may not be possible to delete all unwanted bias, particularly when systems learn from historical data that encodes cultural biases. This workshop will take a rich and cross-domain approach to this complicated problem, providing a venue for researchers to move beyond awareness of the problem of algorithmic and data bias to focus on practical strategies for handling it.
   HWB'19 is a three-quarter-day workshop including two keynotes and a session of discussion papers.
   The first keynote is from Alan Mislove, professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. He will speak about "Measuring bias in social network ad targeting and delivery".
   The second keynote is from Jean Garcia-Gathright, a research scientist at Spotify. She will speak about "Fair machine learning in industry: from research to practice".
   We also have a session highlight two discussion papers. First, Nina Cesare and Elaine Nsoesie from the Department of Global Health at Boston University along with Christian Grant from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma will present their work "Understanding Demographic Bias and Representation in Social Media Health Data". Second, Taha Hassan from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech will present his work "On Bias in Social Reviews of University Courses".
   In recent years, a collection of workshops and conferences have been founded to explore issues of fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics as they intersect with research in a diverse set of technical areas (e.g., FAT-ML to explore issues of fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning, FAT-IR to explore these issues in information retrieval and others). Many of these emerging venues have been highly multi-disciplinary bringing together researchers from computing, law, policy, ethics, anthropology and art. Given the fundamentally multi-disciplinary nature of the Web Science conference, we hope the Handling Web Bias workshop will provide a vibrant venue to discuss these important issues within the Web Science community.
   We thank the ten members of our program committee: Francesco Bonchi (ISI, Italy), Michael Ekstrand (Boise State, USA), Leo Ferres (UDD, Chile), Fosca Gianotti (ISTI/CNR, Italy), Krishna Gummadi (Max Planck Institute, Germany), Darakhshan Mir (Buckell Univ, USA), Chiara Renso (ISTI/CNR, Italy), Drew Roselli (Parallel-M, USA), Livia Ruback (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Nisha Talagala (USA).
   HWB 2019 was jointly organized by NTENT (Carlsbad, CA, USA), Northeastern University at Silicon Valley (San Jose, CA, USA), and Clarkson University (Potsdam, NY, USA). The workshop proceedings are published by ACM DL as part of The Web Science 2019 Companion Proceedings.

TI  - Advancing cluster randomised trials in children's therapy: a survey of the acceptability of trial behaviours to therapists and parents
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions in children's therapy are rare. This is, in part, due to the challenges of the acceptability of common trial designs to therapists and service users. This study investigated the acceptability of participation in cluster randomised controlled trials to therapists and service users. Methods A national electronic survey of UK occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, service managers, and parents of children who use their services. Participants were recruited by NHS Trusts sharing a link to an online questionnaire with children's therapists in their Trust and with parents via Trust social media channels. National professional and parent networks also recruited to the survey. We aimed for a sample size of 325 therapists, 30 service managers, and 60 parents. Trial participation was operationalised as three behaviours undertaken by both therapists and parents: agreeing to take part in a trial, discussing a trial, and sharing information with a research team. Acceptability of the behaviours was measured using an online questionnaire based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability constructs: affective attitude, self-efficacy, and burden. The general acceptability of trials was measured using the acceptability constructs of intervention coherence and perceived effectiveness. Data were collected from June to September 2020. Numerical data were analysed using descriptive statistics and textual data by descriptive summary. Results A total of 345 survey responses were recorded. Following exclusions, 249 therapists and 40 parents provided data which was 69.6% (289/415) of the target sample size. It was not possible to track the number of people invited to take the survey nor those who viewed, but did not complete, the online questionnaire for calculation of response rates. A completion rate (participants who completed the last page of the survey divided by the participants who completed the first, mandatory, page of the survey) of 42.9% was achieved. Of the three specified trial behaviours, 140/249 (56.2%) therapists were least confident about agreeing to take part in a trial. Therapists (135/249, 52.6%) reported some confidence they could discuss a trial with a parent and child at an appointment. One hundred twenty of 249 (48.2%) therapists reported confidence in sharing information with a research team through questionnaires and interviews or sharing routine health data. Therapists (140/249, 56.2%) felt that taking part in the trial would take a lot of effort and resources. Support and resources, confidence with intervention allocation, and sense of control and professional autonomy over clinical practice were factors that positively affected the acceptability of trials. Of the 40 parents, twelve provided complete data. Most parents (18/40, 45%) agreed that it was clear how trials improve children's therapies and outcomes and that a cluster randomised trial made sense to them in their therapy situation (12/29, 30%). Conclusions Using trials to evaluate therapy interventions is, in principle, acceptable to therapists, but their willingness to participate in trials is variable. The willingness to participate may be particularly influenced by their views related to the burden associated with trials, intervention allocation, and professional autonomy.

TI  - A Technology-Based Intervention Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men and Nonbinary People (The Conectad@s Project): Protocol for A Vanguard Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: In many parts of the world, including Brazil, uptake for biomedical interventions has been insufficient to reverse the HIV epidemic among key populations at high risk for HIV, including men who have sex with men. Young MSM (YMSM), particularly Black YMSM, have high HIV incidence, low viral suppression, and low preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence. Therefore, novel approaches to increase the HIV biomedical interventions uptake by YMSM are urgently needed.
   Objective: We describe the Conectad@s Project, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence and incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, the onset of sexual risk behavior, and barriers to biomedical interventions among YMSM aged 18 to 24 years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and (2) conduct a technology-based adherence intervention study to promote a rapid linkage of YMSM to HIV care or prevention, and support and sustain adherence.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey will be conducted with 400 YMSM recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) adapted for social media-based sampling, preceded by a formative phase. HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing will be conducted, including early HIV infection biomarker detection. Behavioral, partnership, network, and structural measures will be collected through structured questionnaires. All individuals recruited for the survey will have access to HIV risk assessment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, prevention counseling, and a technology-based adherence intervention. Those who accept the adherence intervention will receive weekly text messages via a social networking app (WhatsApp) for 24 weeks, with follow-up data collected over 48 weeks.
   Results: The Conectad@s project has been approved by our local institutional review board (#CAAE 26086719.0.0000.4262) in accordance with all applicable regulations. Questionnaires for the RDS survey and intervention were developed and tested in 2020, formative interviews were conducted in January and February 2021 to guide the development of the RDS, and enrollment is planned to begin in early 2022.
   Conclusions: The Conectad@s Project is a vanguard study that, for the first time, will apply digital RDS to sample and recruit YMSM in Brazil and rapidly connect them to ART, PrEP, or prevention counseling through a technology-based adherence intervention. RDS will allow us to estimate HIV prevalence among YMSM and measure HIV infection biomarkers in the context of the onset of risky behavior. The data will lay the groundwork to adapt and implement HIV prevention strategies, identify barriers to the earliest HIV infection diagnosis, immediate ART or PrEP initiation, and detect new clusters of HIV transmission.

TI  - Bayesian reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions highlights substantial proportion of negative serial intervals
T2  - EPIDEMICS
AB  - Background: The serial interval is a key epidemiological measure that quantifies the time between the onset of symptoms in an infector-infectee pair. It indicates how quickly new generations of cases appear, thus informing on the speed of an epidemic. Estimating the serial interval requires to identify pairs of infectors and infectees. Yet, most studies fail to assess the direction of transmission between cases and assume that the order of infections -and thus transmissions -strictly follows the order of symptom onsets, thereby imposing serial intervals to be positive. Because of the long and highly variable incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, this may not always be true (i.e an infectee may show symptoms before their infector) and negative serial intervals may occur. This study aims to estimate the serial interval of different SARS-CoV-2 variants whilst accounting for negative serial intervals. Methods: This analysis included 5 842 symptomatic individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst 2 579 households from September 2020 to August 2022 across England & Wales. We used a Bayesian framework to infer who infected whom by exploring all transmission trees compatible with the observed dates of symptoms, based on a wide range of incubation period and generation time distributions compatible with estimates reported in the literature. Serial intervals were derived from the reconstructed transmission pairs, stratified by variants.Results: We estimated that 22% (95% credible interval (CrI) 8-32%) of serial interval values are negative across all VOC. The mean serial interval was shortest for Omicron BA5 (2.02 days, 1.26-2.84) and longest for Alpha (3.37 days, 2.52-4.04).Conclusions: This study highlights the large proportion of negative serial intervals across SARS-CoV-2 variants. Because the serial interval is widely used to estimate transmissibility and forecast cases, these results may have critical implications for epidemic control.

TI  - Different temperature thresholds for antipyretic intervention in critically ill children with fever due to infection: the FEVER feasibility RCT
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
AB  - Background: Fever accelerates host immune system control of pathogens but at a high metabolic cost. The optimal approach to fever management and the optimal temperature thresholds used for treatment in critically ill children are unknown.
   Objectives: To determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different temperature thresholds for antipyretic management.
   Design: A mixed-methods feasibility study comprising three linked studies -(1) a qualitative study exploring parent and clinician views, (2) an observational study of the epidemiology of fever in children with infection in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and (3) a pilot RCT with an integrated-perspectives study.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from (1) four hospitals in England via social media (for the FEVER qualitative study), (2) 22 PICUs in the UK (for the FEVER observational study) and (3) four PICUs in England (for the FEVER pilot RCT).
   Participants: (1) Parents of children with relevant experience were recruited to the FEVER qualitative study, (2) patients who were unplanned admissions to PICUs were recruited to the FEVER observational study and (3) children admitted with infection requiring mechanical ventilation were recruited to the FEVER pilot RCT. Parents of children and clinicians involved in the pilot RCT.
   Interventions: The FEVER qualitative study and the FEVER observational study had no interventions. In the FEVER pilot RCT, children were randomly allocated (1 : 1) using research without prior consent (RWPC) to permissive (39.5 degrees C) or restrictive (37.5 degrees C) temperature thresholds for antipyretics during their PICU stay while mechanically ventilated.
   Main outcome measures: (1) The acceptability of FEVER, RWPC and potential outcomes (in the FEVER qualitative study), (2) the size of the potentially eligible population and the temperature thresholds used (in the FEVER observational study) and (3) recruitment and retention rates, protocol adherence and separation between groups and distribution of potential outcomes (in the FEVER pilot RCT).
   Results: In the FEVER qualitative study, 25 parents were interviewed and 56 clinicians took part in focus groups. Both the parents and the clinicians found the study acceptable. Clinicians raised concerns regarding temperature thresholds and not using paracetamol for pain/discomfort. In the FEVER observational study, 1853 children with unplanned admissions and infection were admitted to 22 PICUs between March and August 2017. The recruitment rate was 10.9 per site per month. The majority of critically ill children with a maximum temperature of >37.5 degrees C received antipyretics. In the FEVER pilot RCT, 100 eligible patients were randomised between September and December 2017 at a recruitment rate of 11.1 per site per month. Consent was provided for 49 out of 51 participants in the restrictive temperature group, but only for 38 out of 49 participants in the permissive temperature group. A separation of 0.5 degrees C (95% confidence interval 0.2 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C) between groups was achieved. A high completeness of outcome measures was achieved. Sixty parents of 57 children took part in interviews and/or completed questionnaires and 98 clinicians took part in focus groups or completed a survey. Parents and clinicians found the pilot RCT and RWPC acceptable. Concerns about children being in pain/discomfort were cited as reasons for withdrawal and non-consent by parents and non-adherence to the protocol by clinicians.
   Limitations: Different recruitment periods for observational and pilot studies may not fully reflect the population that is eligible for a definitive RCT.
   Conclusions: The results identified barriers to delivering the definitive FEVER RCT, including acceptability of the permissive temperature threshold. The findings also provided insight into how these barriers may be overcome, such as by limiting the patient inclusion criteria to invasive ventilation only and by improved site training. A definitive FEVER RCT using a modified protocol should be conducted, but further work is required to agree important outcome measures for clinical trials among critically ill children.

TI  - Characterizing mood disorders in the AFFECT study: a large, longitudinal, and phenotypically rich genetic cohort in the US
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - There has recently been marked progress in identifying genetic risk factors for major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD); however, few systematic efforts have been made to elucidate heterogeneity that exists within and across these diagnostic taxa. The Affective disorders, Environment, and Cognitive Trait (AFFECT) study presents an opportunity to identify and associate the structure of cognition and symptom-level domains across the mood disorder spectrum in a prospective study from a diverse US population. Participants were recruited from the 23andMe, Inc research participant database and through social media; self-reported diagnosis of MD or BD by a medical professional and medication status data were used to enrich for mood-disorder cases. Remote assessments were used to acquire an extensive range of phenotypes, including mood state, transdiagnostic symptom severity, task-based measures of cognition, environmental exposures, personality traits. In this paper we describe the study design, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort. In addition we report genetic ancestry, SNP heritability, and genetic correlations with other large cohorts of mood disorders. A total of 48,467 participants were enrolled: 14,768 with MD, 9864 with BD, and 23,835 controls. Upon enrollment, 47% of participants with MD and 27% with BD indicated being in an active mood episode. Cases reported early ages of onset (mean = 13.2 and 14.3 years for MD and BD, respectively), and high levels of recurrence (78.6% and 84.9% with >5 episodes), psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication use. SNP heritability on the liability scale for the ascertained MD participants (0.19-0.21) was consistent with the high level of disease severity in this cohort, while BD heritability estimates (0.16-0.22) were comparable to reports in other large scale genomic studies of mood disorders. Genetic correlations between the AFFECT cohort and other large-scale cohorts were high for MD but not for BD. By incorporating transdiagnostic symptom assessments, repeated measures, and genomic data, the AFFECT study represents a unique resource for dissecting the structure of mood disorders across multiple levels of analysis. In addition, the fully remote nature of the study provides valuable insights for future virtual and decentralized clinical trials within mood disorders.

TI  - Social listening - revealing Parkinson's disease over day and night
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background Nocturnal symptoms in Parkinson's disease are often treated after management of daytime manifestations. In order to better understand the unmet needs of nocturnal symptoms management, we analyzed the characteristics and burden of nocturnal symptoms from patients' perspectives and explored their changes over time. Overall symptoms (occurring at day or night) were collected to compare whether the unmet needs related to nocturnal symptoms and to overall symptoms are different. Methods We used a Social Listening big-data technique to analyze large amounts of Parkinson's disease symptoms in dialogues available from social media platforms in 2016 to 2018. These symptoms were classified as either overall symptoms or nocturnal symptoms. We used share of voice (SOV) of symptoms as a proportion of total dialogues per year to reflect the characteristics of symptoms. Negative sentiment score of symptoms was analyzed to find out their related burden. Results We found the SOV for overall motor symptoms was 79% and had not increased between 2016 and 2018 (79%, p = 0.5). The SOV for non-motor symptoms was 69% and had grown by 7% in 2018 (p < 0.01). The SOV for motor complications was 9% and had increased by 6% in 2018 (p < 0.01). The SOV of motor symptoms was larger than non-motor symptoms and motor complications (p < 0.01). The SOV of non-motor symptoms was larger than motor complications (p < 0.01). For nocturnal symptoms, 45% of the analyzed PD population reported nocturnal symptoms in 2018, growing by 6% (p < 0.01). The SOV for nocturnal-occurring motor symptoms was higher than most non-motor symptoms. However, non-motor symptoms had the higher increases and evoked higher negative sentiment regardless of whether they occurred during the day or night. For symptoms that can occur at either day or night, each nocturnal symptom was rated with a higher negative sentiment score than the same symptom during the day. Conclusions The growing SOV and the greater negative sentiment of nocturnal symptoms suggest management of nocturnal symptoms is an unmet need of patients. A greater emphasis on detecting and treating nocturnal symptoms with 24-h care is encouraged.

TI  - Incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus post COVID-19 vaccination: A cross-sectional study in India
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Several sociodemographic variables, including ethnic inequality, have been identified as potentially influencing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at least 70-85% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus post-vaccination.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and side effects were collected.
   Results: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25-34 years (38.6%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7% had received Covishield and 17.8% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1% have received both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9% had received only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated individuals had a gap of 4-5 weeks for the second dose (37.1%) followed by 5-6 weeks (11.2%). Post-vaccination 50.8% had experienced muscle pain, 46% had experienced fatigue, 36.5% weakness, and 12.3% back pain. Among vaccinated 26% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and 44.5% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the second time experienced either through vaccination or infection demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening complications.
   Conclusion: Although more than 50% of the vaccinated individuals experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high acceptance rate (74%) of vaccination among the participants. The vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to the non-vaccinated individuals.

TI  - Using Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Assess the Adopt Intention of a Proposed IoT-Based Health Management Tool
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Advancements in IoT technology contribute to the digital progress of health science. This paper proposes a cloud-centric IoT-based health management framework and develops a system prototype that integrates sensors and digital technology. The IoT-based health management tool can collect real-time health data and transmit it to the cloud, thus transforming the signals of various sensors into shared content that users can understand. This study explores whether individuals in need tend to use the proposed IoT-based technology for health management, which may lead to the new development of digital healthcare in the direction of sensors. The novelty of this research lies in extending the research perspective of sensors from the technical level to the user level and explores how individuals understand and adopt sensors based on innovatively applying the IoT to health management systems. By organically combining TAM with MOA theory, we propose a comprehensive model to explain why individuals develop perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and risk regarding systems based on factors related to motivation, opportunity, and ability. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the online survey data collected from respondents. The results showed that perceived usefulness and ease of use positively impacted adoption intention, Perceived ease of use positively affected perceived usefulness. Perceived risk had a negative impact on adoption intention. Readiness was only positively related to perceived usefulness, while external benefits were positively related to perceived ease of use and negatively related to perceived risk. Facilitative conditions were positively correlated with perceived ease of use and negatively correlated with perceived risk. Technical efficacy was positively related to perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Overall, the research model revealed the cognitive mechanism that affects the intention of individuals to use the system combining sensors and the IoT and guides the digital transformation of health science.

TI  - A Task-Technology-Identity Fit Model of Smartwatch Utilisation and User Satisfaction: A Hybrid SEM-Neural Network Approach
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB  - Smartwatches are wearable devices intended to be smartphone companions that capture health data and ease access to notifications. They have also become personalisable standing as a fashion statement. This combination resulted in staggering adoption rates recently leading to question whether smartwatch users' choice and use satisfaction emerge from utility features or from its fashion characteristics. This paper proposes and validates a fit theory to investigate the antecedents of adopters' satisfaction. Besides evaluating fit with identity, the model assesses both perceived and actual task-technology fit of smartwatches. A questionnaire-based quantitative approach is used to collect data from about 300 smartwatch users in Qatar. To test the proposed model, data is analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Furthermore, ANN sensitivity analysis ranks the importance of the fit factors affecting users' choice during pre- and post-adoption stages. Both task-technology and technology-identity fit factors are quasi-equally important in explaining 62% of satisfaction variance. ANN analysis revealed that post-adoption satisfaction is primarily attributed to smartwatches' ability to fit with users' identity and secondarily to its perceived fit with tasks. Nevertheless, pre-adoption choice of smartwatches is mainly guided by their functionality. This paper is the first to propose and validate an integrated task-technology-identity fit model to explain smartwatch utilization and users' satisfaction. The originality also lies in assessing actual task-technology fit and as perceived by users. Employing two modes of analysis revealed extra insights too.

TI  - Survey of Clinician Experiences of Telepsychiatry and Tele-Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to implement telepsychiatry across practice models. Objective: We sought to evaluate the overall success of this change and to identify what types of practice settings, provider groups, and patient groups were best served by telepsychiatry and telepsychotherapy utilization. We were particularly inter-ested in how providers of consultation-liaison psychiatry adapted to remote care. Methods: An anonymous provider survey querying demographics, education, training, technological experience, practice setting, treatment modalities, patient groups, transition process, and outcomes was made openly available via social media and professional listservs. We used multivariable regression modeling to evaluate for predictors of the positive outcomes of overall satisfaction, subjective ability to diagnose and treat patients adequately using exclusively telepsychiatric platforms, and patient satisfaction by proxy. Results: Three hundred thirty-three respondents, mostly young (59.4% younger than 50 years), female (69.7%), and physicians (67.9%), completed the survey. One hundred ninety-seven (59.1%) worked in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Of the total, 85.9% gave affirmative answers to overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression models found that satisfaction was predicted by general comfort with technology (P < 0.001), but negatively correlated with having technical issues (P < 0.001), a priori skepticism (P < 0.001), clinician being male (P = 0.004), and treating LGBTQ+ patients (P = 0.022). Completeness was associated with having training in tele-health (P = 0.039) and general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) but negatively associated with treating LGBTQ+ patients (P = 0.024) or inpatients (P = 0.002). Patient satisfaction by proxy was positively associated with general comfort with technology (P < 0.001) and the respondent being a nonphysician (P = 0.004) and negatively associated with encountering a technical issue (P = 0.013) or treating inpatients (P = 0.045). Consultation-liaison psychiatrists had similar results overall and were more likely to have other staff assist in making televisits effective (mean [standard deviation]: -1.25 [3.57] versus -2.76 [3.27], P < 0.001) especially if consultative (mean [standard deviation]: -0.87 [3.67] versus -2.39 [3.01], P = 0.010). Conclusions: This study suggests high rates of overall satisfaction in telepsychiatry adoption, even in consultation -liaison psychiatry. There is distinct benefit in bolstering training, providing technical support, and addressing skepticism. Future research should include patient surveys and control groups and should focus on vulnerable populations such as sexual and gender minorities.

TI  - Use of nutritional food labels and consumers' confidence in label information
T2  - REVISTA DE NUTRICAO-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB  - Objective
   This investigation evaluated the use of food labels and consumers' perception of the reliability of food labels nutritional information.
   Methods
   This is a transversal exploratory quantitative investigation, carried out in Curitiba, Brazil. A total of 536 students from a public institution participated in the survey answering a structured questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact test were performed considering a significance level of 5%.
   Results
   The participants' mean age was 21.11 +/- 2.83 years, and 59.3% were female. It was noticed that 41.6% of consumers used the nutritional information sometimes and 14.7% always, mainly because they liked to know what they were buying and consuming (35.8%). Lack of patience (29.5%) and concern about the composition of the food purchased (34.2%) were the main reasons for not using the information provided. commonly used nutrition claim was "trans fat-free" (42.5%) and the type of food in which nutrition labeling was used most was milk and dairy products (42.0%). Frequent use of nutritional information was higher among women (p<0.01) and among those who practice physical activity (p=0.04). Many individuals relied on food labels nutritional information (61.9%), but out of these, 43.6% did not use that information at the time of purchase. There was no difference between respondents' confidence in the information, sociodemographic and health data.
   Conclusion
   Many people still do not use the label nutrition information. Efforts should be made to change this scenario. Changes in nutrition labeling can help modify this situation, with the use of clearer label information, more easily understood, that does not raise any doubts in the consumers' mind.

TI  - Is It Just About Physical Health? An Online Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jordan in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background
   Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at national and international levels were directed to mitigate the spread of the disease and its physical harm, paying less attention to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at early stages of the pandemic. Objectives
   This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions have explored our study's second and third aims. Results
   A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR = 0.64, P = 0.022; 95% CI: 0.44-0.94), and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, P = 0.048; 95% CI: 0.01-0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, P = 0.049; 95% CI: 1.10-3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR = 2.49, P = 0.007; 95% CI: 1.29-4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media platforms (n = 269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning as their most distressing concern. Conclusion
   The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. We recommend a nationwide psychological support program to be incorporated into Jordan's preparedness plan and response strategy in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Knowledge user survey and Delphi process to inform development of a new risk of bias tool to assess systematic reviews with network meta-analysis (RoB NMA tool)
T2  - BMJ EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE
AB  - Background Network meta-analysis (NMA) is increasingly used in guideline development and other aspects of evidence-based decision-making. We aimed to develop a risk of bias (RoB) tool to assess NMAs (RoB NMA tool). An international steering committee recommended that the RoB NMA tool to be used in combination with the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool (i.e. because it was designed to assess biases only) or other similar quality appraisal tools (eg, A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 [AMSTAR 2]) to assess quality of systematic reviews. The RoB NMA tool will assess NMA biases and limitations regarding how the analysis was planned, data were analysed and results were presented, including the way in which the evidence was assembled and interpreted. Objectives Conduct (a) a Delphi process to determine expert opinion on an item's inclusion and (b) a knowledge user survey to widen its impact. Design Cross-sectional survey and Delphi process. Methods Delphi panellists were asked to rate whether items should be included. All agreed-upon item were included in a second round of the survey (defined as 70% agreement). We surveyed knowledge users' views and preferences about the importance, utility and willingness to use the RoB NMA tool to evaluate evidence in practice and in policymaking. We included 12 closed and 10 open-ended questions, and we followed a knowledge translation plan to disseminate the survey through social media and professional networks. Results 22 items were entered into a Delphi survey of which 28 respondents completed round 1, and 22 completed round 2. Seven items did not reach consensus in round 2. A total of 298 knowledge users participated in the survey (14% respondent rate). 75% indicated that their organisation produced NMAs, and 78% showed high interest in the tool, especially if they had received adequate training (84%). Most knowledge users and Delphi panellists preferred a tool to assess both bias in individual NMA results and authors' conclusions. Response bias in our sample is a major limitation as knowledge users working in high-income countries were more represented. One of the limitations of the Delphi process is that it depends on the purposive selection of experts and their availability, thus limiting the variability in perspectives and scientific disciplines. Conclusions This Delphi process and knowledge user survey informs the development of the RoB NMA tool.

TI  - BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE AND THE LIFE SCIENCES
T2  - ETHICS AND INTEGRITY IN HEALTH AND LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH
AB  - Big Data analysis is one of the key challenges to the provision of health care to emerge in the last few years. This challenge has been spearheaded by the huge interest in the "4Ps" of health care (predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory). Big Data offers striking development opportunities in health care and life sciences. Healthcare research is already using Big Data to analyze the spatial distribution of diseases such as diabetes mellitus at detailed geographic levels. Big Data is also being used to assess location-specific risk factors based on data of health insurance claims. Other studies in systems medicine utilize bioinformatics approaches to human biology which necessitate Big Data statistical analysis and medical informatics tools. Big Data is also being used to develop electronic algorithms to forecast clinical events in real time, with the intent to improve patient outcomes and thus reduce costs.
   Yet, this Big Data era also poses critically difficult ethical challenges, since it is breaking down the traditional divisions between what belongs to public and private domains in health care and health research. Big Data in health care raises complex ethical concerns due to use of huge datasets obtained from different sources for varying reasons. The clinical translation of this Big Data is thus resulting in key ethical and epistemological challenges for those who use these data to generate new knowledge and the clinicians who eventually apply it to improve patient care.
   Underlying this challenge is the fact that patient consent often cannot be collected for the use of individuals' personal data which then forms part of this Big Data. There is also the added dichotomy of healthcare providers which use such Big Data in attempts to reduce healthcare costs, and the negative impact this may have on the individual with respect to privacy issues and potential discrimination.
   Big Data thus challenges societal norms of privacy and consent. Many questions are being raised on how these huge masses of data can be managed into valuable information and meaningful knowledge, while still maintaining ethical norms. Maintaining ethical integrity may lack behind in such a fast-changing sphere of knowledge. There is also an urgent need for international cooperation and standards when considering the ethical implications of the use of Big Data-intensive information.
   This chapter will consider some of the main ethical aspects of this fast-developing field in the provision of health care, health research, and public health. It will use examples to concretize the discussion, such as the ethical aspects of the applications of Big Data obtained from clinical trials, and the use of Big Data obtained from the increasing popularity of health mobile apps and social media sites.

TI  - Scenario prediction of public health emergencies using infectious disease dynamics model and dynamic Bayes
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB  - This study was aimed to discuss the predictive value of infectious disease dynamics model (IDD model) and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for scenario deduction of public health emergencies (PHEs). Based on the evolution law of PHEs and the meta-scenario representation of basic knowledge, this study established a DBN scenario deduction model for scenario deduction and evolution path analysis of PHEs. At the same time, based on the average field dynamics model of the SIR network, the dimensionality reduction process was performed to calculate the epidemic scale and epidemic time based on the IDD model, so as to determine the calculation methods of threshold value and epidemic time under emergency measures (quarantine). The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) epidemic was undertaken as an example to analyze the results of DBN scenario deduction, and the infectious disease dynamics model was used to analyze the number of reproductive numbers, peak arrival time, epidemic time, and latency time of the COVID epidemic. It was found that after the M1 measure was used to process the S1 state, the state probability and the probability of being true (T) were the highest, which were 91.05 and 90.21, respectively. In the sixth stage of the development of the epidemic, the epidemic had developed to level 5, the number of infected people was about 26, and the estimated loss was about 220 million yuan. The comprehensive cumulative foreground (CF) values of O1 similar to O3 schemes were -1.34, -1.21, and -0.77, respectively, and the final CF values were -1.35, 0.01, and-0.08, respectively. The final CF value of O2 was significantly higher than the other two options. The household infection probability was the highest, which was 0.37 and 0.35 in Wuhan and China, respectively. Under the measures of home quarantine, the numbers of confirmed cases of COVID in China and Wuhan were 1.503 (95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.328 similar to 1.518) and 1.729 (95% CI = 1.107 similar to 1.264), respectively, showing good fits with the real data. On the 21st day after the quarantine measures were taken, the number of COVID across the country had an obvious peak, with the confirmed cases of 24495, and the model prediction value was 24085 (95% CI = 23988 similar to 25056). The incubation period 1/q was shortened from 8 days to 3 days, and the number of confirmed cases showed an upward trend. The peak period of confirmed cases was advanced, shortening the overall epidemic time. It showed that the prediction results of scenario deduction based on DBN were basically consistent with the actual development scenario and development status of the epidemic. It could provide corresponding decisions for the prevention and control of COVID based on the relevant parameters of the infectious disease dynamic model, which verified the rationality and feasibility of the scenario deduction method proposed in this study.

TI  - SEPSIS. Educational and Best Practice Frontiers. Beyond the Boundaries of Fatality, Enhancing Clinical Skills and Precision Medicine
T2  - THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Dissemination and exploitation of knowledge regarding affordable clinical skills and innovative precision medicine, two current topics in active development in medicine, may contribute to improve also sepsis management. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is strongly related to all body organs or to systemic diseases and to the quality of the best-practice in use, which is particularly critical in surgical or intervention techniques. Trauma, surgical and mini-invasive procedures, vascular or endoscopic interventions, otolaryngology, obstetrics-gynecological and urological procedures, malnutrition, dental, skin, chronic liver, kidney and respiratory disease are frequently involved. Accordingly, apart from the clinical risk analysis and management of the process of care, the actual factors that may be easily neglected are the techniques used, the personal skills of the health professionals and the quality of the equipment. The quest for biomarkers consistent with the unmet needs of medical doctors and of their patient and the efforts for overcoming bacterial antibiotic resistances are currently the main foci of medical research. In addition, in this regard, research and innovation would benefit from greater knowledge, skills and use of bioinformatics and omics. The caveats related to in-silico approaches must be flagged: algorithms may equally warrant scientific innovations or hide the lack of them; a patient is more than a set of covariates. Epidemiology and prevention includes all the actions suitable for achieving an adequate hygiene and immunization of populations and for safer hospital policies and procedures during Patients' stays. In any subset, the most unresolved critical point in sepsis is a timely diagnosis. This is impaired by low degrees of suspicion for the possibility of emerging sepsis, by the shortage of use of the simplest microbiological testing but, equally or more, by the insufficient diffusion of non-invasive imaging skills suitable to detect and monitor the emerging sites and sources of infection. In primary care, in emergency facilities, in hospital wards and in intensive care units, inclusion of appropriate knowledge, skills, expertise and imaging equipment must be extended as much as possible. The low cost of UltraSound machines and of increasing bioinformatics literacy by e-learning, makes such investments affordable even in limited-resources contexts. Frontier educational and best practice intervention enhancing affordable clinical skills and innovative precision medicine may lead beyond the boundaries of fatal outcomes in sepsis.

TI  - Using Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Monitor Behavioral Changes During COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, countries have adopted nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and full lockdown. An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed.
   Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID -19.
   Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background.
   Results: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more.
   Conclusions: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.

TI  - Family resilience and neighborhood factors affect the association between digital media use and mental health among children: does sleep mediate the association?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB  - The associations between digital media use and mental well-being among children and adolescents have been inconclusive. We examined (i) the associations between digital media use and mental health outcomes, anxiety, depression, and ADHD, (ii) whether family resilience and neighborhood factors attenuate the associations, and (iii) whether sleep mediates these associations. We used the National Survey of Children's Health data from 2019 to 2020. A total of 45,989 children's (6-17 years) data were analyzed in this study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between digital media use and anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Path models and Paramed command in STATA were used to test the role of sleep as a mediator of these associations. The prevalence of heavy digital media users (who spent 4 or more hours per day) among the analytic sample was 30.52%, whereas anxiety was 13.81%, depression was 5.93%, and ADHD was 12.41%. Children in the heavy media user group had 63% increased odds of anxiety (95% CI: 1.32-2.01) and 99% increased odds of depression (95% CI: 1.35-2.94) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, compared to the children in light media user group (who spent < 2 h per day), and these relations were significant at 0.01 level. However, family resilience and community factors significantly attenuated the effect of digital media use on anxiety and depression. Sleep did not mediate the associations between digital media use and anxiety or depression.Conclusions: Family resilience and neighborhood factors protect against the harmful effects of digital media use. Further research is needed to examine the relationships of media contents, the presence of electronic devices in bedrooms, and sleep quality with mental health.

TI  - Verification of the Goldilocks Hypothesis: the association between screen use, digital media and psychiatric symptoms in the Growing Up in Ireland study
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Aims This study aims to replicate Przybylski and Weinstein (Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017), using a large population cohort to examine the validity of the proposed Goldilocks Hypothesis, which states that moderate digital media engagement may be beneficial and that both high and low usage may have a negative relationship with mental wellbeing.
   Methods Using the GUI98 cohort, we used separate weekday and weekend time-based categorical variables indicating time spent online, playing video games, watching TV/films as well as a frequency variable indicating multiscreening, and their associations with SDQ internalizing and externalizing symptoms using linear and quadratic regression parameters. We followed procedures for confounder adjustments outlined in Przybylski and Weinstein (Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017).
   Results As hypothesized by the Goldilocks Hypothesis, time spent online watching TV/films at the weekend and multiscreening all had curvilinear relationships with internalizing and externalizing symptoms with significantly higher symptoms for no time as well as for higher exposures. internalizing and externalizing symptoms increased with time spent playing video games.
   Conclusions This brief report supports the Goldilocks Hypothesis, that suggests that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may instead be beneficial, even necessary in a world becoming ever more increasingly reliant on digital media (Przybylski and Weinstein in Psychol Sci 28(2):204-215, 2017).

TI  - Demand for Health Information on COVID-19 among Vietnamese
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus, Vietnam introduced its first national partial lockdown on April 1st, 2020. The public relied on online sources, whether through official websites or phone-based applications, to acquire up-to-date health information, provide accurate instructions, and limit misinformation. This study aims to provide insight regarding the current level of awareness of the pandemic, and to identify associated factors in Vietnamese participants to recommend necessary interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based survey during the first week of the lockdown period. There were 341 observations collected using a snowball sampling technique. A Tobit multivariable regression model was used to identify factors associated with the demand for each category of health information. The most requested information was the latest updated news on the epidemic, followed by information about disease symptoms and updated news on the outbreak. The prevalence of diverse socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnic factors in Vietnam requires consideration of the specific health information needs of unique groups. Identifying group-specific demands would be helpful to provide proper information to fulfill each population group's needs.

TI  - Public Interest in Acne on the Internet: Comparison of Search Information From Google Trends and Naver
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease primarily affecting young adults. Given that the internet has become a major source of health information, especially among the young, the internet is a powerful tool of communication and has a significant influence on patients.
   Objective: This study aimed to clarify the features of patients' interest in and evaluate the quality of information about acne vulgaris on the internet.
   Methods: We compared the search volumes on acne vulgaris with those of other dermatological diseases using Google Trends from January 2004 to August 2019. We also determined the search volumes for relevant keywords of acne vulgaris on Google and Naver and evaluated the quality of answers to the queries in KnowledgeiN.
   Results: The regression analysis of Google Trends data demonstrated that the patients' interest in acne vulgaris was higher than that for other dermatological diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (beta=-20.33, 95% CI -22.27 to -18.39, P<.001) and urticaria (beta=-27.09, 95% CI -29.03 to -25.15, P<.001) and has increased yearly (beta=2.38, 95% CI 2.05 to 2.71, P<.001). The search volume for acne vulgaris was significantly higher in the summer than in the spring (beta=-5.04, 95% CI -9.21 to -0.88, P=.018) and on weekends than on weekdays (beta=-6.68, 95% CI -13.18 to -0.18, P=.044). The most frequently searched relevant keywords with "acne vulgaris" and "cause" were "stress," "food," and "cosmetics." Among food, the 2 highest acne vulgaris-related keywords were milk and wheat in Naver and coffee and ramen in Google. The queries in Naver KnowledgeiN were mostly answered by a Korean traditional medicine doctor (53.4%) or the public (33.6%), but only 12.0% by dermatologists.
   Conclusions: Physicians should be aware of patients' interest in and beliefs about acne vulgaris to provide the best patient education and care, both online and in the clinic.

TI  - Awareness about prostate cancer and its screening in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia population
T2  - UROLOGY ANNALS
AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a global burden on public health; it has been ranked as the second common cancer worldwide, with 1.3 million new cases in 2018. Developed countries have a higher incidence than in developing countries. Because of the lack of studies on PCa in Saudi Arabia, our study aims to measure the awareness about PCa and knowledge of PCa screening practices among men in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study conducted among males in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from 2(nd) to 10(th) July 2020, using a validated questionnaire. The sample size was 1212 participants. Data collected through an online questionnaire. All data analyses performed using (SPSS) software, using the Chi-square test for bivariate analysis. All levels of significance were set at P < 0.05. Results: We collected 1212 completed surveys, with mean ages of 36 years (standard deviation 12.77). We found that 77% of participants heard about PCa, and 52.5% heard about PCa screening tests. This study showed that only 10.6% of all participants had good knowledge, 41.9% had fair knowledge, and 47.5% had poor knowledge. Only 3.9% of participants had experienced the prostate-specific antigen test. Conclusion: The study showed that the level of knowledge of PCa is low. Thus, community and individuals should collaborate to increase awareness by having more awareness campaigns, disseminating the information through the media, and encouraging men to do screening tests as indicated. In addition, including more Saudi Arabia cities in future studies is preferable to have more precise outcomes.

TI  - Evaluation of sleep quality, psychological states and subsequent self-medication practice among the Bangladeshi population during Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Due to the extended lockdown imposed for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many people have experienced problematic sleep patterns and associated health issues worldwide. This study was conducted to assess the sleep quality and psychological states of the Bangladeshi population during the COVID-19 pandemic, respondent's behavioral traits as well as psychological or sleep-related problems induced self-medication practice among the respondents, along with the probability of development of drug dependency.
   Methods: The survey was conducted among 2941 respondents from 25th November 2020 to 4th December 2020 where the responses were analyzed by SPSS V22.
   Results: 10-29.5% experienced a significant degree of sleep problems whereas some experienced severe anxiety and depression. The associations between the behavioral traits and parameters concerning sleep quality, anxiety and depression showed 5% level of significance in all cases. Self-medication practice of sleep aids during this pandemic was reported by 7.14% of the respondents, with a greater percentage belonging to the female or senior age group. Tendency to repeatedly self-medication was observed in 18.86% of this self-medicating populace, and a greater number of male (10.26%) respondents displayed such tendency as opposed to their female (8.6%) equivalents. However, 48.10% of the respondents reported perceptions of improved physical and/or psychological health following self-medication, and this trait was predominant in men (52.14%).
   Conclusion: Results showed a significant number of Bangladeshi populaces were suffering from psychological issues during this COVID-19 which also influenced a certain number of people towards self-medication practice where signs of drug dependency were observed in a significant number of respondents.

TI  - Casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for traumatic brain injury in the Global Neurotrauma Outcomes Study: a prospective observational cohort study
T2  - LANCET NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognised as being responsible for a substantial proportion of the global burden of disease. Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for patients with TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on this patient population. We aimed to characterise differences in casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI across different levels of human development.
   Methods We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience sample of hospitals identified by open invitation, through international and regional scientific societies and meetings, individual contacts, and social media. Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each hospital's 30-day study period were all eligible for inclusion, with the exception of patients undergoing insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor only, ventriculostomy placement only, or a procedure for drainage of a chronic subdural haeinatoma. The primary outcome was mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation if the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were stratified according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite of life expectancy, education, and income measures-into very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI, and low HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the effect of HDI on mortality while accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and between-country variation.
   Findings Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57 countries, collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20%) records were from countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33%) from countries in the high HDI tier, 614 (38%) from countries in the medium HDI tier, and 154 (9%) from countries in the low HDI tier. The median age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the oldest patients in the very high HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the youngest in the low HDI tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common procedures were elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69 [45%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the medium HDI tier (189 [31%]) and high HDI tier (173 [32%]), and evacuation of a supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high HDI tier (155 [47%]). Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 18% (299 of 1635). After adjustment for casernix, the odds of mortality were greater in the medium HDI tier (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.55-5.2) and high HDI tier (2.26, 1.23-4.15), but not the low HDI tier (1.66, 0.61-4.46), relative to the very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in mortality (median OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.17-2.49).
   Interpretation Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI differed considerably in their admission characteristics and management across human development settings. Level of human development was associated with mortality. Substantial opportunities to improve care globally were identified, including reducing delays to surgery. Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests changes at an institutional level could influence outcome and comparative effectiveness research could identify best practices.

TI  - Recent increases in depressive symptoms among US adolescents: trends from 1991 to 2018
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundMental health problems and mental health related mortality have increased among adolescents, particularly girls. These trends have implications for etiology and prevention and suggest new and emerging risk factors in need of attention. The present study estimated age, period, and cohort effects in depressive symptoms among US nationally representative samples of school attending adolescents from 1991 to 2018.MethodsData are drawn from 1991 to 2018 Monitoring the Future yearly cross-sectional surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students (N=1,260,159). Depressive symptoms measured with four questions that had consistent wording and data collection procedures across all 28years. Age-period-cohort effects estimated using the hierarchical age-period-cohort models.ResultsAmong girls, depressive symptoms decreased from 1991 to 2011, then reversed course, peaking in 2018; these increases reflected primarily period effects, which compared to the mean of all periods showed a gradual increase starting in 2012 and peaked in 2018 (estimate=1.15, p<0.01). Cohort effects were minimal, indicating that increases are observed across all age groups. Among boys, trends were similar although the extent of the increase is less marked compared to girls; there was a declining cohort effect among recently born cohorts, suggesting that increases in depressive symptoms among boys are slower for younger boys compared to older boys in recent years. Trends were generally similar by race/ethnicity and parental education, with a positive cohort effect for Hispanic girls born 1999-2004.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are increasing among teens, especially among girls, consistent with increases in depression and suicide. Population variation in psychiatric disorder symptoms highlight the importance of current environmental determinants of psychiatric disorder risk, and provide evidence of emerging risk factors that may be shaping a new and concerning trend in adolescent mental health.

TI  - Online help for people with suicidal thoughts provided by charities and healthcare organisations: a qualitative study of users' perceptions
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Internet use is common among people with suicidal feelings and a considerable amount of suicide help material is available online. Despite attempts to promote formal help sites (e.g. governmental and charity sector) in internet search results, users' evaluation of these sites is lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to explore distressed users' perceptions of formal online help and their experiences of using this in times of crisis. Methods In-depth interview study of 53 adults reporting suicide-related internet use. Results While highly valued in relation to general mental health problems, formal sites were not perceived to meet the different needs of those experiencing suicidal thoughts, and did not engage individuals in crisis. Sites were criticised for being impersonal, dispassionate, too focused on information-giving, and lacking solutions that were novel or sensitive to reasons why an individual may choose to seek help online. Most participants criticised the tendency for sites to signpost to offline services as their primary response. Participants desired immediacy and responsive online help incorporating 'live chat', self-help tools, opportunities to interact with others and lived-experience content. Positive accounts of seeking online help described sites incorporating these features. Conclusions Formal online help services should be reappraised to ensure they meet users' needs for immediacy and responsive help to capitalise upon the opportunity available for suicide prevention.

TI  - Behavior-related risk factors for opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma among rural people living along the mekong river in five greater mekong subregion countries
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
CP  - NTD-Asia-International-Research-Network Conference
AB  - Opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma (OV-CCA) is a major public health problem in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Countries, the poorest region in Asia. People in this region have similar traditions or respect the same religion. There is no difference in lifestyle and food culture. Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar (a reference area). This study provided the behavior-related risk factors for OV-CCA among people in five GMS Countries which would be a major jigsaw puzzle leading to proactive surveillance for OV-CCA prevention in the future.

TI  - Risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers and the general community: a prospective cohort study
T2  - LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Data for front-line health-care workers and risk of COVID-19 are limited. We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk.
   Methods We did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms. We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test. The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509.
   Findings Among 2 035 395 community individuals and 99 795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34 435 272 person-days. Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11.61, 95% CI 10.93-12.33). To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3.40, 95% CI 3.37-3.43). Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors.
   Interpretation In the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers. Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Do children's expectations about future physical activity predict their physical activity in adulthood?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Much of the population fails to meet recommended physical activity (PA) levels, but there remains considerable individual variation. By understanding drivers of different trajectories, interventions can be better targeted and more effective. One such driver may be a person's physical activity identity (PAI)-the extent to which a person perceives PA as central to who they are.
   Methods: Using survey information and a unique body of essays written at age 11 from the National Child Development Study (N = 10 500), essays mentioning PA were automatically identified using the machine learning technique support vector classification and PA trajectories were estimated using latent class analysis. Analyses tested the extent to which childhood PAI correlated with activity levels from age 23 through 55 and with trajectories across adulthood.
   Results: 42.2% of males and 33.5% of females mentioned PA in their essays, describing active and/or passive engagement. Active PAI in childhood was correlated with higher levels of activity for men but not women, and was correlated with consistently active PA trajectories for both genders. Passive PAI was not related to PA for either gender.
   Conclusions: This study offers a novel approach for analysing large qualitative datasets to assess identity and behaviours. Findings suggest that at as young as 11 years old, the way a young person conceptualizes activity as part of their identity has a lasting association with behaviour. Still, an active identity may require a supportive sociocultural context to manifest in subsequent behaviour.

TI  - <i>Trichinella</i> spp. infection in European polecats (<i>Mustela putorius</i> Linnaeus, 1758) from Romania
T2  - HELMINTHOLOGIA
AB  - The European polecat (Mustela putorius Linnaeus, 1758) is in decline in Romania, often living near human settlements, from mountains to lowlands. They feed on a wide variety of small animals, including rodents, such as mice or rats. The occurrence of this parasite in polecats from Romania was mentioned only once in 1991, but the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular biology. The study aimed to investigate the occurrence of Trichinela spp. in European polecats from Romania and to identify the parasite species by molecular tools. A total of 75 wild European polecats were examined by trichinoscopy and artificial digestion. A large number of animals were examined because of their wide distribution in Romanian territory and their presence near human settlements. For species determination, the positive muscle samples and the larvae recovered from artificial digestion were collected for DNA isolation and further processed by means of Multiplex PCR.
   Only two polecats from southern Romania tested positive for Trichinella spp. infection. During trichinoscopy examination, 48 (in a polecat from Giurgiu County) and 78 (in a polecat from Ialomia County) cysts were found in the tested (56 samples/animal) tissue samples. Artificial digestion revealed infection with 2466 larvae/100 g of muscle in the polecat from Ialomia and 254/100 g in the polecat from Giurgiu. The Multiplex PCR indicated the occurrence of Trichinella spiralis in the polecat from Giurgiu and a co-infection with T. spiralis and T. britovi in the polecat from Ialomia.
   The current study confirms through molecular biology, the occurrence of T. spiralis and T. britovi, as well as the occurrence of co-infection with these two Trichinella species in European polecats from Romania.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COMPUTER SCIENCE WEEK MULTICONFERENCE (ACSW 2019)
CP  - Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference (ACSW)
AB  - Play based systems, such as computer games, have proven effective as tools to enhance our human understanding, skills and capabilities in a number of real world activities. The active pursuit of gamification and applied games for tasks from education to design, training and simulation continues to grow. The field of healthcare is one key area offering significant potential. Raising the question of whether play based assistive tools, as a means to create greater understanding of serious medical conditions, and the health and lifestyle impacts they cause, can be effective. This research involved both the review of play based systems that are dedicated to assisting with diabetes, as well as the development of a new watch based mobile App designed specifically to assist players (both diabetic as well as broader community) in understanding the complex nature of managing diabetes. Diabetes is listed as the sixth leading cause of death worldwide and its improved management is listed as a priority by the world health organization. The results from the randomized control trial of the new watch based tool showed that participants who used the play based watch App, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of their understanding of the condition and its management. This highlights the potential of play based digital tools to bring greater understanding of complex medical conditions to patients, care givers and the broader population.

TI  - Can a documentary increase help-seeking intentions in men? A randomised controlled
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background We investigated whether a public health intervention-a three-part documentary called Man Up which explored the relationship between masculinity and mental health, well-being and suicidality-could increase men's intentions to seek help for personal and emotional problems.
   Methods We recruited men aged 18 years or over who were not at risk of suicide to participate in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned (1: 1) via computer randomisation to view Man Up (the intervention) or a control documentary. We hypothesised that 4 weeks after viewing Man Up participants would report higher levels of intention to seek help than those who viewed the control documentary. Our primary outcome was assessed using the General Help Seeking Questionnaire, and was analysed for all participants. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616001169437, Universal Trial Number: U1111-1186-1459) and was funded by the Movember Foundation.
   Results Three hundred and fifty-four men were assessed for eligibility for the trial and randomised to view Man Up or the control documentary. Of these, 337 completed all stages (nine participants were lost to follow-up in the intervention group and eight in the control group). Linear regression analysis showed a significant increase in intentions to seek help in the intervention group, but not in the control group (coef.=2.06, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.63, P=0.01).
   Conclusions Our trial demonstrates the potential for men's health outcomes to be positively impacted by novel, media-based public health interventions that focus on traditional masculinity.

TI  - The prevalence of internet addiction and its association with quality of life among clinically stable patients with major depressive disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Internet addiction (IA) is associated with mental health problems but its impact on quality of life (QOL) is understudied. We examined the prevalence of IA and its association with QOL in clinically stable patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey between September 2020 and July 2021, the Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief version scale (WHOQOL-BREF) were administered to 1267 patients with MDD. Logistic regression was used to examine the correlates of IA, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the association between IA and QOL."
   Results: The prevalence of IA (IAT total scores >= 50) was 27.2 % (95 % CI: 24.7 %-29.6 %) in MDD patients. Compared to patients without IA, those with IA had lower QOL (F( 1, 1267) = 19.1, P < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that higher education (senior high school and above; OR = 1.85, 95 % CI: 1.13-3.03), family history of psychiatric disorders (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI: 1.08-2.73), and higher PHQ-2 total score (OR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.14-1.32) were positively associated with IA while older age (OR = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.91-0.96) was inversely related to IA.
   Conclusion: IA is much more common in clinically stable patients with MDD compared to the reported figures in the general population. It would be prudent to screen and monitor internet use in MDD patients and treat those with IA.

TI  - Deprivation and exposure to public activities during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB  - Background Differential exposure to public activities may contribute to stark deprivation-related inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes but has not been directly investigated. We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus Watch-a large community cohort study based in England and Wales-reported differential exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the autumn-winter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation. Methods Participants (n=20 120-25 228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during 3 weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants' residential postcode using English or Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed-effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period. Results Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) range across time points: 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR: 3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR: 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR: 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR: 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods. Conclusion Differential exposure to essential public activities-such as attending workplaces and visiting essential shops-is likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes. Public health interventions to reduce exposure during essential activities and financial and practical support to enable low-paid workers to stay at home during periods of intense transmission may reduce COVID-related inequalities.

TI  - Management of Fracture Risk in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Building a UK Consensus Through Healthcare Professional and Patient Engagement
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
AB  - Introduction: Osteoporosis and bone fractures are common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Current national guidance on COPD management recommends addressing bone health in patients, however, does not detail how. This consensus outlines key elements of a structured approach to managing bone health and fracture risk in patients with COPD.
   Methods: A systematic approach incorporating multifaceted methodologies included detailed patient and healthcare professional (HCP) surveys followed by a roundtable meeting to reach a consensus on what a pathway would look like.
   Results: The surveys revealed that fracture risk was not always assessed despite being recognised as an important aspect of COPD management by HCPs. The majority of the patients also stated they would be receptive to discussing treatment options if found to be at risk of osteoporotic fractures. Limited time and resource allocation were identified as barriers to addressing bone health during consultations. The consensus from the roundtable meeting was that a proactive systematic approach to assessing bone health should be adopted. This should involve using fracture risk assessment tools to identify individuals at risk, investigating secondary causes of osteoporosis if a diagnosis is made and reinforcing non-pharmacological and preventative measures such as smoking cessation, keeping active and pharmacological management of osteoporosis and medicines management of corticosteroid use. Practically, prioritising patients with important additional risk factors, such as previous fragility fractures, older age and long-term oral corticosteroid use for an assessment, was felt required.
   Conclusion: There is a need for integrating fracture risk assessment into the COPD pathway. Developing a systematic and holistic approach to addressing bone health is key to achieving this. In tandem, opportunities to disseminate the information and educational resources are also required.

TI  - Child and adolescent musculoskeletal pain (CAM-Pain) feasibility study: testing a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data from children and adolescents who consult about a musculoskeletal condition in UK general practice
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives Test a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data from children and adolescents who consult their general practitioner about a musculoskeletal condition.
   Design Prospective cohort feasibility study.
   Setting 13 general practices in West Midlands of England.
   Participants Patients aged 8-19 years who consult their general practice about a musculoskeletal condition. Patients were identified via a relevant musculoskeletal Read code entered at the point of consultation.
   Outcome measures Feasibility was assessed in terms of study processes (recruitment rates), data collection procedures (duration, response variability), resource utilisation (mail-outs) and ethical considerations (acceptability).
   Results From October 2016 to February 2017, an eligible musculoskeletal Read code was entered on 343 occasions, 202 patients were excluded (declined, n=153; screened not suitable, n=49) at the point of consultation. The remaining 141 patients were mailed an invitation to participate (41.1%); 46 patients responded to the invitation (response rate: 32.6%), of which 27 patients consented (consent rate: 19.1%). Participants mean age was 13.7 years (SD 2.7) and current pain intensity was 2.8 (SD 2.7). All participants completed the 6-week follow-up questionnaire. All participants found the interview questions to be acceptable and would consider participating in a similar study in the future. The majority of general practitioners/nurse practitioners, and all of the research nurses reported to be adequately informed about the study and found the study processes acceptable.
   Conclusion The expected number of participants were identified and invited, but consent rate was low (<20%) indicating that this method is not feasible (eg, for use in a large prospective study). Recruiting children and adolescents with musculoskeletal conditions in a primary care setting currently presents a challenge for researchers. Further work is needed to identify alternative ways to conduct studies in this population in order to address the current knowledge gap in this field.

TI  - Coping Mechanisms and Resources for Patients Suffering from Rosacea
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC CLINICS
AB  - Rosacea has significant quality of life impact. The authors review the literature and Internet sources pertaining to rosacea to identify coping mechanisms and resources available to patients with rosacea. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify pertinent articles. The term "rosacea" was searched in combination with "patient resources," "coping," "dealing with," "blog," "forum," "support," "nonpharmacologic," and "psychological." There are several social and educational coping resources available to patients with rosacea. These may optimize quality of life and psychosocial outcomes in patients with rosacea.

TI  - Data mining and machine learning techniques applied to public health problems: A bibliometric analysis from 2009 to 2018
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The objective of this paper is to present a bibliometric analysis of the applications of Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the context of public health from 2009 to 2018. A systematic review of the literature was conducted considering three major scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct. This enabled an analysis of the number of papers by journal, the countries where the applications were carried out, which databases are more commonly used, the most studied topics in public health, and the techniques, programming languages and software applications most frequently used by researchers. Our results showed a slight increase in the number of papers published in 2014 and a significative increase since 2017, focusing mostly on infectious, parasitic and communicable diseases, chronic diseases and risk factors for chronic diseases. The Journal of Medical Internet Research and PLoS ONE published the highest number of papers. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were the most common technique, while R and WEKA were the most common programming language and software application, respectively. The U.S. was the most common country where the studies were conducted. In addition, Twitter was the most frequently used source of data by researchers. Hence, this paper provides an overview of the literature on DM and ML in the field of public health and serves as a starting point for beginner and experienced researchers interested in this topic.

TI  - Urban flood modelling combining cellular automata framework with semi-implicit finite difference numerical formulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Urban flooding is increasingly pervasive, with dreadful impacts on people and development assets. Whilst the frequency of occurrence of this hazard, mainly from pluvial events, is of fundamental importance in climate change and earth sciences research, the severity of its impacts motivates major debates within the context of flood risk management and sustainable urban development. The present study focuses on the development of a novel flood model, as a contribution to meeting the challenges of flood risk assessment within data poor urban areas such as in Nigeria. The new model combines the full functionality of cellular automata (CA) framework with a semi-implicit finite difference numerical scheme (SIFDS), whilst the resulting algorithms were programmed within MATLAB (TM) programming platform. In this study, computation complexity and distributed topographic data requirement, both which are associated with flood modelling, and which tend to present a major limitation to flood modelling in the developing countries (DCs) are being addressed. A highly urbanized area within the Lagos metropolis of Nigeria was chosen as a case study to validate the model and to simulate the July 10th 2011 flooding event. A 2-m horizontal resolution LiDAR DEM, published Manning's friction coefficients and rainfall intensity, were used as data inputs into the new flood model. Simulated results compared well with actual flooding inundations, reported by urban residents, and detailed in some literature and by the media. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between predicted flood depth and estimated values is 0.968. It is expected that the challenges of urban flooding in Lagos particularly and in the DCs generally will be better addressed if robust, but low-cost flood models are developed and utilized in the assessment of flood damage.

TI  - A Comparative NLP-Based Study on the Current Trends and Future Directions in COVID-19 Research
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - COVID-19 is a global health crisis that has altered human life and still promises to create ripples of death and destruction in its wake. The sea of scientific literature published over a short time-span to understand and mitigate this global phenomenon necessitates concerted efforts to organize our findings and focus on the unexplored facets of the disease. In this work, we applied natural language processing (NLP) based approaches on scientific literature published on COVID-19 to infer significant keywords that have contributed to our social, economic, demographic, psychological, epidemiological, clinical, and medical understanding of this pandemic. We identify key terms appearing in COVID literature that vary in representation when compared to other virus-borne diseases such as MERS, Ebola, and Influenza. We also identify countries, topics, and research articles that demonstrate that the scientific community is still reacting to the short-term threats such as transmissibility, health risks, treatment plans, and public policies, underpinning the need for collective international efforts towards long-term immunization and drug-related challenges. Furthermore, our study highlights several long-term research directions that are urgently needed for COVID-19 such as: global collaboration to create international open-access data repositories, policymaking to curb future outbreaks, psychological repercussions of COVID-19, vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 variants and their long-term efficacy studies, and mental health issues in both children and elderly.

TI  - Structure and trends of externalizing and internalizing psychiatric symptoms and gender differences among adolescents in the US from 1991 to 2018
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Purpose We aimed to estimate the structure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and potential time dynamics in their association. This is understudied among adolescents, despite increasing internalizing and decreasing externalizing symptoms in recent years.
   Methods We analyzed data from US Monitoring the Future cross-sectional surveys (1991-2018) representative of school-attending adolescents (N = 304,542). Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood estimation method and promax rotation resulted in a two-factor solution (factor correlation r = 0.24) that differentiated eight internalizing and seven conduct-related externalizing symptoms. Time-varying effect modification linear regression models estimated the association between standardized internalizing and externalizing symptoms factor scores over time overall and by gender.
   Results In 2012, trends in average factor scores diverged for internalizing and externalizing factors. The average standardized internalizing factor score increased from - 0.03 in 2012 to 0.06 in 2013 and the average externalizing factor score decreased from - 0.06 in 2011 to - 0.13 in 2012. We found that for every one-unit increase in standardized internalizing factor score, standardized externalizing factor score increased by 0.224 units in 2010 (95% CI: 0.215, 0.233); the magnitude of this increase was 22.3% lower in 2018 (i.e., 0.174 units; 95% CI: 0.160, 0.188). Decoupling of internalizing and externalizing symptoms began earlier among boys (similar to 1995) than among girls (similar to 2010).
   Conclusion The decoupling of internalizing and externalizing symptoms among adolescents suggests that changes in the prevalence of shared risk factors for adolescent psychiatric symptoms affect these dimensions in opposing directions, raising the importance of considering symptoms and their risk factors together in prevention and intervention efforts.

TI  - Equine helminth prevalence and management practices on Australian properties as shown by coprological survey and written questionnaire
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context Parasite control is an essential part of a broader equine health-management strategy and is often completely administered by the horse owner, with little or no supporting evidence on which to base decisions. Practical and sound advice relies on knowledge of the resident parasite species, the anthelmintic resistance status of important species, and the strategies currently being utilised by owners and managers of horses. Much of this farm-level information is lacking in the Australian literature. Aims The present study aimed to gather both farm- and horse-level prevalence data for four important equine helminth species and to gather information on the current worm-management practices conducted on Australian horse farms. Methods We conducted a coprological survey of cyathostomins,Strongylus vulgaris,Parascarisspp. and equine tapeworm on 102 horse properties, using a combination of classical and molecular parasitological methods, including a tapeworm polymerase chain reaction developed as part of the study. A questionnaire canvasing horse owners on internal parasite-control practices was also distributed. Key results Cyathostomin were present on all farms surveyed andS. vulgaris, despite being considered rare, was present on 7.8% (95% CI: 3.9-15.0) of farms. The prevalence ofParascarisspp. and equine tapeworm was 33.3% (95% CI: 19.6-50.6) and 3.9% (95% CI: 1.5-10.1) respectively. Questionnaire responses showed that the majority (85.0%) of horse owners administer anthelmintics at regular intervals of 12 weeks or less, and only 2.6% utilise faecal egg counts to inform treatment decisions. Conclusions Prevalence data confirmed the endemic nature of cyathostomin andP. equoruminfections, as well as low levels of tapeworm andS. vulgarisinfections on Australian horse farms. Worm-management practices were reminiscent of traditional interval-style treatment regimens that rely heavily on macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics. Implications These results suggest a need for more strategic approaches to internal-parasite control in horses to slow the development of anthelmintic resistance. Such programs need to consider the risk of re-establishment of the pathogenicS. vulgarisin significant numbers.

TI  - Failure of leadership in US academic medicine after George Floyd's killing by police and amidst subsequent unrest
T2  - ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - The horrific nature of George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis Police Department officer on May 25, 2020 sparked an enduring stretch of nationwide protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. During periods of crisis, anchor institutions may exert leadership by issuing pub-lic statements to communicate shared institutional values, enhance morale, and signal direction in the face of crisis. In our analysis of public statements issued by 56 leading U.S. medical schools, we found that nearly all identified George Floyd by name, and a majority noted the role of racism or acknowledged the Black community specifically. Fewer referenced the act resulting in Floyd's death or made explicit reference to the police. Far fewer explicitly used terms denoting active support, like "antiracism" or "Black Lives Matter." Only a minority of institutions made reference to the killing of George Floyd by the police, and most failed to address this country's targeted, historically engrained, and sustained oppression of Black people through white supremacy. Thus, there remain significant opportunities for U.S. medical schools to exert meaningful leadership in public health. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Multi-tissue Transcriptome Analysis of Human Metabolites Guides Interpretability of Associations Based on Multi-SNP Models for Gene Expression
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
AB  - There is particular interest in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) gene-level tests based on multi-SNP predictive models of gene expression-for identifying causal genes at loci associated with complex traits. However, interpretation of TWAS associations may be complicated by divergent effects of model SNPs on phenotype and gene expression. We developed an iterative modeling scheme for obtaining multi-SNP models of gene expression and applied this framework to generate expression models for 43 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We characterized the performance of single- and multi-SNP models for identifying causal genes in GWAS data for 46 circulating metabolites. We show that: (A) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression than did the top cis-eQTL (median 2-fold improvement); (B) predicted expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (false discovery rate < 0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite pairs, but, after stepwise conditional analyses, 90% were dominated by a single eQTL SNP; (C) among the 35% of associations where a SNP in the expression model was a significant cis-eQTL and metabolomic-QTL (met-QTL), 92% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in multi-SNP models; and (D) using a "truth'' set of causal genes at 61 met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67%), but the positive predictive value was low, as only 8% of TWAS associations (19% when restricted to colocalized associations at met-QTLs) involved true causal genes. These results guide the interpretation of TWAS and highlight the need for corroborative data to provide confident assignment of causality.

TI  - Cancer and Risk ofCOVID-19 Through a General Community Survey
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
AB  - Individuals with cancer may be at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and adverse outcomes. However, evidence from large population-based studies examining whether cancer and cancer-related therapy exacerbates the risk of COVID-19 infection is still limited. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 29 through May 8, 2020. Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared with participants without cancer, those living with cancer had a 60% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test. Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of a positive test. The association between cancer and COVID-19 infection was stronger among participants >65 years and males. Future studies are needed to identify subgroups by tumor types and treatment regimens who are particularly at risk for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes.

TI  - Tracking Changes in Mobility Before and After the First SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Using Global Positioning System Data in England and Wales (Virus Watch): Prospective Observational Community Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that individuals may change adherence to public health policies aimed at reducing the contact, transmission, and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after they receive their first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination when they are not fully vaccinated. Objective: We aimed to estimate changes in median daily travel distance of our cohort from their registered addresses before and after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: Participants were recruited into Virus Watch starting in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants, and vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onward. Between September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch participants to contribute toward our tracker subcohort, which uses the GPS via a smartphone app to collect data on movement. We used segmented linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Results: We analyzed the daily travel distance of 249 vaccinated adults. From 157 days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median daily travel distance was 9.05 (IQR 8.06-10.09) km. From the day of vaccination to 105 days after vaccination, the median daily travel distance was 10.08 (IQR 8.60-12.42) km. From 157 days prior to vaccination until the vaccination date, there was a daily median decrease in mobility of 40.09 m (95% CI -50.08 to -31.10; P<.001). After vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of 60.60 m (95% CI 20.90-100; P<.001). Restricting the analysis to the third national lockdown (January 4, 2021, to April 5, 2021), we found a median daily movement increase of 18.30 m (95% CI -19.20 to 55.80; P=.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and a median daily movement increase of 9.36 m (95% CI 38.6-149.00; P=.69) in the 30 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting high-volume geolocation data as part of research projects and the utility of these data for understanding public health issues. Our various analyses produced results that ranged from no change in movement after vaccination (during the third national lock down) to an increase in movement after vaccination (considering all periods, up to 105 days after vaccination), suggesting that, among Virus Watch participants, any changes in movement distances after vaccination are small. Our findings may be attributable to public health measures in place at the time such as movement restrictions and home working that applied to the Virus Watch cohort participants during the study period.

TI  - Solidarity and the problem of structural injustice in healthcare
T2  - BIOETHICS
AB  - The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice.
   It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry "costs" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity).
   Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity.
   In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders.
   Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see.
   In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social.
   Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering.
   As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states.
   Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock.
   According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate.
   These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective.
   For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves.
   I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice.
   There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
   They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available.
   In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required.
   Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases.
   For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases.
   This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson.
   The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view.
