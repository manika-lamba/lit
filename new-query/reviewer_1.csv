Empirical evidence about which communication strategies are effective around breastfeeding messaging is scarce. To fill this gap, we aimed to identify influencers in the largest available Twitter database using social network analysis (n = 10,694 users), inductively analyze tweets, and explore communication strategies, motivations, and challenges via semi-structured interviews. Influencers had diverse backgrounds within and beyond the scientific health community (SHC; 42.7\%): 54.7\% were from the general public and 3\% were companies. SHC contributed to most of the tweets (n = 798 tweets), disseminating guidelines and research findings more frequently than others (p < 0.001). Influencers from the general community mostly tweeted opinions regarding the current state of breastfeeding research and advocacy. Interviewees provided practical strategies (e.g., preferred visuals, tone, and writing style) to achieve personal and societal goals including career opportunities, community support, and improved breastfeeding practices. Complex challenges that need to be addressed were identified. Ideological differences regarding infant feeding may be hampering constructive communication, including differences in influencers' interpretation of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and in perspectives regarding which social media interactions encompass conflict of interest.","10.3390/ijerph18126181","6181",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000666522800001",NA,"Rehm, Martin/0000-0002-9553-7008 Caduff, Anita/0000-0002-2736-2170 Perez-Escamilla, Rafael/0000-0001-9416-8039",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6

In Nigeria, stillbirths are a common public health problem. However, limited attention has been given to the social ramifications of stillbirths. This study describes the social networks of women who have experienced a stillbirth and the factors influencing their social networks. Interviews and social network diagrams were used to collect data from 20 women about their social networks before and after stillbirth. Findings suggest that the experience of shame, unmet expectation of support, and a lack of trust led to relationship changes after stillbirth. Most participants met bereavement needs with their existing social networks before stillbirth, but many participants also experienced relationship losses (even among family networks).

Such method has been applied to many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO) returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to study drug policy.","10.1371/journal.pone.0282340","e0282340","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000996122900034","Ritter, Alison/K-1195-2012 ","/0000-0003-3582-3261",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11

Objective: Health conspiracy theories are gaining in popularity. This study's objective was to evaluate the Twitter social media network related to the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and apply social capital theory to analyze the unique social structures of influential users. As a strategy for web-based public health surveillance, we conducted a social network analysis to identify the important opinion leaders sharing the conspiracy, the key websites, and the narratives. Methods: A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using social network analysis. Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13, 2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. Tweets were retrieved via a dedicated Twitter application programming interface. More specifically, the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research Foundation) and Gephi. Results: There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users within the data set. This study found that the most influential user within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the magnetic vaccine conspiracy. There were also several other users that became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the network. Conclusions: Our study found that influential users were effective broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond their own networks of Twitter followers. We emphasize the need for trust in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be unpredictable. This study highlights the potential of influential users to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique social capital.","10.2196/43497","e43497","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:001005979900003","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/L-6071-2017 ","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/0000-0002-1027-0165 Fuster-Casanovas, Aina/0000-0001-9128-9580 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12

Method/process We study SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' personal (i.e., self-disclosure) and situational (i.e., social networks) attributes, using a mixed design of content analysis and social network analysis. Result/conclusion We compare users' within-person changes in self-disclosure and social networks in two phases (over half a year), drawing on Weibo Depression SuperTalk, an online community for depression, and find: Several network attributes strengthen social support, including network connectivity, global efficiency, degree centralization, hubs of communities, and reciprocal interactions. Users' self-disclosure attributes reflect positive changes in mental well-being and increased attachment to the community. Correlations exist between users' topological and self-disclosure attributes. A Poisson regression model extracts self-disclosure attributes that may affect users' received social support, including the writing length, number of active days, informal words, adverbs, negative emotion words, biological process words, and first-person singular forms. Innovation We combine social network analysis with content analysis, highlighting the need to understand SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' self-disclosure (content) and communication partners (social networks). Implication/contribution Authentic user data helps to avoid recall bias commonly found in self-reported data. A longitudinal within-person analysis of SNS' effects on well-being is helpful for policymakers in public health intervention, community managers for group organizations, and users in online community engagement.","10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1092884","1092884","1664-1078",NA,"WOS:000967089900001",NA,"Khoo, Zhao Wei/0009-0009-8469-7864 shi, jiayi/0000-0003-4215-3374",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16

For public health campaigns, how to diffuse the message broadly and efficiently in the social network is a classical problem, which is named Influence Maximization (IM). IM can be considered as an algorithmic problem of finding a small set of network users as seed nodes that maximizes the spread of influence for a piece of information under a certain influence cascade model. With a lot of researches focusing on this field, most existing solutions are proposed to extract seed nodes only considering pure topological structures. In practice, nodes in health-related networks are often abundantly accompanied with other types of meaningful information such as node attributes (identity), second-order proximity, and edge attributes (user relationship), while conventional IM models overlook these information. Therefore, a general framework for incorporating the heterogeneous information into an IM model could be potentially helpful to find underlying seed nodes in health-related networks. Moreover, the stability and the computational cost are also the main challenges that current IM models face. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose NE-IM (Network Embedding for Influence Maximization), a method that aspires to address both problems using representation learning. NE-IM composes of two components: Structure-based embedding and feature-based embedding. They are the projections of network structures and heterogeneous information respectively in a low dimensional space, so that each node in health-related network can be represented as a fix dimensional vector. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform baseline approaches.","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946391",NA,"2169-3536",NA,"WOS:000497163000067","ZHANG, hui jie/HTN-1690-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19

Most of the proposals have focused on dealing with static datasets gathered from social networks, which are processed and mined off-line. However, little work has been done on providing a general framework to analyse the highly dynamic data of social networks from a multidimensional perspective. In this paper, we claim that such a framework is crucial for including social data in PHS systems. Methods: We propose a dynamic multidimensional approach to deal with social data streams. In this approach, dynamic dimensions are continuously updated by applying unsupervised text mining methods. More specifically, we analyse the semantics and temporal patterns in posts for identifying relevant events, topics and users. We also define quality metrics to detect relevant user profiles. In this way, the incoming data can be further filtered to cope with the goals of PHS systems. Results: We have evaluated our approach over a long-term stream of Twitter. We show how the proposed quality metrics allow us to filter out the users that are out-of-domain as well as those with low quality in their messages. We also explain how specific user profiles can be identified through their descriptions. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed multidimensional model can be used to identify main events and topics, as well as to analyse their audience and impact. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed dynamic multidimensional model is able to identify relevant events and topics and analyse them from different perspectives, which is especially useful for PHS systems.","10.3390/ijerph17072289","2289",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000530763300121","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/ABF-5171-2021 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/K-9590-2014","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/0000-0002-8026-8351 Lanza Cruz, Indira Lazara/0000-0003-2413-2799 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/0000-0002-9155-269X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20

Background: Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has more recently been used to study health-related topics including obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence, quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and reproducibility. Methods: We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks, take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters. Results: We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also present an example of SNA.

Little attention has been paid to the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals. Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt MDRO transmission across a health care network.","10.1177/0033354920930213","0033354920930213","0033-3549","1468-2877","WOS:000540706300001","Rankin, Danielle A/AAT-8589-2021 ","Rankin, Danielle A/0000-0003-3018-3373 Matthews, Sarah/0000-0001-8372-1185","JUN 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28

However, given the different niches which platforms occupy in terms of information exchange, reliance on a single platform would provide an incomplete picture of public opinions. Based on the schema theory, this study suggests a `social media platform schema' to indicate users' different expectations based on previous usages of platform and argues that a platform's distinct characteristics foster distinct platform schema and, in turn, distinct nature of information. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine side effect -related discussions from Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube, each of which represents a different type of the platform, and found thematic and emotional differences across platforms. Thematic analysis using k-means clustering algorithm identified seven clusters in each platform.

Yet, little is known about the role of the park and recreation sector to such health sector initiatives. The purpose of our study was to analyse the flow of information across a multi-sectoral mental health group hiking programme in Canada. Design/methodology/approach: We used an online questionnaire to survey social service agency staff involved in delivering the programme in 63 communities. We collected data about their information seeking practices regarding four types of information: hiking and parks, mental health, funding sources, and the Mood Walks programme. Findings: Social network analysis confirmed that social service agencies turned to park and recreation sector partners for information about hiking and local hiking amenities but did not seek information from them about mental health, funding sources, or the programme itself. Practical implications: Park and recreation sector partners are viewed by other sectoral partners as sources of critical information in the delivery of this park-based health initiative. Research contribution: This study illustrates the utility of social network analysis in understanding multi-sectoral park-based health programmes and confirms the relevance of the park and recreation sector to public health initiatives in nature settings.","10.1080/23750472.2021.1932563",NA,"2375-0472","2375-0480","WOS:000655370700001","Rich, Kyle/AAH-2893-2019","Rich, Kyle/0000-0001-7552-4747","MAY 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31

Specifically, to study the potential level of exposure, the article models a uni-directional information-sharing pathway beginning when a Facebook user encounters a vaccine-related post with a YouTube video, follows this video to YouTube, and then sees a list of related videos automatically recommended by YouTube. The results demonstrate that despite the efforts by Facebook and YouTube, COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation in the form of anti-vaccine videos propagates on both platforms. Because of these apparent gaps in platform-led initiatives to combat misinformation, public health agencies must be proactive in creating vaccine promotion campaigns that are highly visible on social media to overtake anti-vaccine videos' prominence in the network. By examining related videos that a user potentially encounters, the article also contributes practical insights to identify influential YouTube channels for public health agencies to collaborate with on their public service announcements about the importance of vaccination programs and vaccine safety.","10.1177/20563051221150403","20563051221150403","2056-3051",NA,"WOS:001061149700001",NA,"Song, Melodie Yunju/0000-0002-3492-6835 Gruzd, Anatoliy/0000-0003-2366-5163",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online information, particularly information on social media. The first step toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization debate on social media platforms.Objective: We aimed to evaluate societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance.Methods: Social network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets published in English and French were collected through the Twitter application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised machine learning approach to natural language processing using a sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine hesitancy.Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) of the conversations on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) expressed criticism toward the government's handling of the pandemic.Conclusions: Social media content analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered, as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.","10.2196/28800","e28800",NA,"2564-1891","WOS:001129248500004","Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015 ","Benham, Jamie L/0000-0002-2233-4613 Fullerton, Madison/0000-0002-8345-2859 Tang, Theresa/0000-0001-8569-5953 Mourali, Mehdi/0000-0002-9969-3892 Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37

Algorithmic recommendation-based technology along with users' selective exposure and group pressure lead to online echo chambers, causing inefficiency in vaccination promotion. Avoiding or breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior. Objective: With the ultimate goal of eliminating the impact of echo chambers related to vaccine hesitancy on social media during public health emergencies, the aim of this study was to develop a framework to quantify the echo chamber effect in users' topic selection and attitude contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations; detect online opinion leaders and structural hole spanners based on network attributes; and explore the relationships of their behavior patterns and network locations, as well as the relationships of network locations and impact on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Methods: We called the Sina Weibo application programming interface to crawl tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user information on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Adopting social network analysis, we examined the low echo chamber effect based on topics in representational networks of information, according to attitude in communication flow networks of users under different interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual analyses were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and to explore their function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Results: Users showed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, whereas the opposite trend was found for the latter. Speakers, replicators, and monologists tended to be opinion leaders, whereas common users, retweeters, and networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and spanners tended to be ``bridgers{''} to disseminate diverse topics and communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, users who tended to echo a single topic could bridge multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also tended to serve as bridgers for different attitudes. Conclusions: This study not only revealed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine hesitancy, but further elucidated the underlying reasons from the perspective of users, offering insights for research about the form, degree, and formation of echo chambers, along with depolarization, social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination pattern of topic, and sentiment. Therefore, this work can help to provide strategies for public health and public opinion managers to cooperate toward avoiding or correcting echo chamber chaos and effectively promoting online vaccine campaigns.","10.2196/40701","e40701","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000964999100004",NA,"Wang, Dandan/0000-0002-5319-5820",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44

Because of the uncertainty and life-cycle characteristics of public health emergencies, emergency information release represents the process of time dynamics. At present, it is an inevitable trend to establish a collaborative mechanism for emergency information release of public health emergencies to improve the release efficiency and respond to public demand. To determine time evolution characteristics of organizational collaboration in emergency information release, this study took the response to COVID-19 from the central government of China as an example and conducted research based on social network analysis. Based on information from COVID-19-related press conferences held by China's central government, the emergency information release collaborative networks (EIRCNs), and Emergency Organizations-Emergency Information Release Matters (EOs-EIRMs) 2-mode network were constructed. With the time evolution, the tightness, convergence, stability, and connectivity of EIRCNs in public health emergencies presented the process of lowering and then raising. At different stages, the core emergency organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs continued to maintain a certain degree of activity. Their dynamic processes showed the characteristics of diversification rather than homogeneity. The time evolution of emergency information release matters (EIRMs) reflected the dynamic adjustment of the government's prevention and control measures and responded to the diversification of the public's understanding and protection needs during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further examined the driving factors and implementation mechanism of the time evolution characteristics of the collaborative mode of emergency information release. The implementation of EIRMs at different stages had different resource requirements, which were usually achieved by introducing new EOs (Adding resource increment) or increasing the collaborative frequencies among EOs (Activating resource stock). In addition, further research prospects and feasibility interpretation were proposed.","10.3389/fpubh.2022.970514","970514",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000891145900001",NA,"Dong, Changqi/0000-0002-2806-6824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48

The producers of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the public's willingness to comply with public health measures.

To contribute to that debate, we examined how health journalists from the mainstream news organizations in the U.S. used Twitter's @mention for sourcing during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a sample of public Twitter posts published by the journalists, we formed co-@mentioned networks (i.e., two sources were connected if @mentioned in the same post) to examine the structure of the networks and identify important sourcing informants. Among the results, elite sources (e.g., health journalists and health experts in the public sector) and influential users (i.e., verified users with a large number of followers and who post frequently) dominated the sourcing repertoire. Moreover, the networks were fragmented because the sources were clustered into several close-knit subgroups.

Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed methodology approach to analyze tweets with COVID-19-related hashtags. First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings Results - found very little misinformation and disinformation distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum engagement. Tweets by citizens focusing on personal experience or opinions received more retweets and likes compared to any other sender type. Similarly, celebrities received more replies than any other sender type. Practical implications - This study helps medical experts and government agencies understand the type of COVID-19 content and communication being shared on social media for population health purposes. Originality/value - This study offers insight into how social media users engage with COVID-19-related information on Twitter and offers a typology of categories of information shared about the pandemic.

Data Sources We used 2018 National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems data, a nationally representative cohort of the US public health systems. Study Design Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of tribal organization participation in public health networks and to understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574 respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of 258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services participating in the network and the scope of public health activities implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of tribal organizations remains low.","10.1111/1475-6773.14012",NA,"0017-9124","1475-6773","WOS:000806587300001",NA,"Owsley, Kelsey/0000-0002-3745-4976 Bauer, Kyla/0000-0003-0074-6374","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,64

Families consisting of child (aged 9-11 years), mother, and father were recruited from colonias on the Texas-Mexico border for participation in a 6-week father-focused, family-centered program concentrated on healthy eating and active living. Fathers reported up to 5 people with whom they were active most in the previous month before and after the program as well as how often they were active with the person and what activities they did most often. Multilevel regression models examined changes in networks. Fathers (n = 42; mean age = 39.07 years, SD = 7.45) were significantly more likely to report more frequent PA with others after the program as compared with before. General active play and conditional support were mentioned most frequently.

Industry funding is contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network analysis. Methods We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of funding, and THR stance. Results About 284 (20\%) out of 1405 authors were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors. E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association with undisclosed industry support. Conclusions Authors with industry support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be necessary to achieve funding parity.","10.1093/ntr/ntac250",NA,"1462-2203","1469-994X","WOS:000885661300001","Hendlin, Yogi/Q-9777-2019 ","Hendlin, Yogi/0000-0002-1714-6132 Vassey, Julia/0000-0003-3002-2000","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,74

Eliminating the disease requires collaboration among important government, community, healthcare providers and non-governmental organizations representatives working on schistosomiasis. The current level of cooperation and collaboration among these representatives in Oyo state, Nigeria is unknown. This study aimed to measure the extent and strength of collaboration among these representatives looking at three relationships: contact, collaboration and resource sharing activities using social network analysis method. Undertaking this research will support a better understanding of barriers against meeting the disease elimination deadline. The social network analysis found that the three relationships patterns had considerable clustering among representatives and few connections, signifying low interconnectedness across several representative groups. The contact and collaborative relationships were the most active, with the resource-sharing network having the lowest amount of interconnectedness. Representatives were more active in rural areas than urban, and representatives in the organized government and the public health system were the most active actors in the schistosomiasis control program. The schistosomiasis control program's representative's poor connectedness, unbalanced relationships patterns should be addressed in order to stimulate improvement and reach the WHO schistosomiasis elimination objective. BackgroundSchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease elimination requires collaboration between stakeholders, country ownership and the involvement of community-level stakeholders. The state of stakeholder relationship determines the ease and timeliness of meeting disease elimination targets. Mapping stakeholder relationships is critical for assessing gaps in the schistosomiasis control program implementation, and providing a roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study aimed to measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo state, Nigeria. Materials and methodsThis study used a Network Representative design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The study was conducted within Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North (urban) and Akinyele (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a link-tracing approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare, academia, and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed using Gephi software for network cohesion across the three networks. ResultsThe social network analysis revealed high clustering and low density across the three networks implying low cohesion across multiple stakeholder categories. The contact and collaborative networks were the most active with the lowest level of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network. Stakeholders were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and stakeholders within the organized governance and public health system were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control program. ConclusionThe low cohesion, high clustering and low network density among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis control program should be addressed in other to drive innovation and meet the WHO schistosomiasis elimination target.","10.1371/journal.pntd.0011266","e0011266","1935-2735",NA,"WOS:000970599600001","Diehl, Jan Carel/L-6621-2013","Onasanya, Adeola/0000-0001-9599-4316 Diehl, Jan Carel/0000-0002-4007-2282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,87

The data for the study were collected through a content analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally be conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health disasters, calling for a careful design of governance structures for disaster response.","10.3390/ijerph19010018","18",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000752645300001",NA,"Han, Ahreum/0000-0001-6519-0579 Lee, Keon-Hyung/0000-0003-1885-4314",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89

With the increasing use of social networks, relationships from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts. Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85\%. The evaluation shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time.","10.1007/s12559-020-09806-5",NA,"1866-9956","1866-9964","WOS:000604851700007",NA,"Beg, Mirza/0000-0001-5789-2933","JAN 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,91

This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of `actor-actants' and `issue-actants,' and between the adoption of `field' and `contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as \#hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the `echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.","10.1080/1369118X.2022.2032260",NA,"1369-118X","1468-4462","WOS:000753311300001","Cai, Xiaolan/HZH-9596-2023 ","Cai, Xiaolan/0000-0002-1708-7304 Khan, Md Irfanuzzaman/0000-0003-2671-7053 Holland, Kate/0000-0003-3873-5769 O'Neil, Mathieu/0000-0002-3537-9036","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,92

To date, however, the socioecological factors that determine whether, when or where wild animals take risks by interacting with humans and anthropogenic factors still remains unclear. We adopt a comparative approach to address this gap, using social network analysis (SNA). SNA, increasingly implemented to determine human impact on wildlife ecology, can be a powerful tool to understand how animal socioecology influences the spatiotemporal distribution of human-wildlife interactions. For 10 groups of rhesus, long-tailed and bonnet macaques (Macaca spp.) living in anthropogenically impacted environments in Asia, we collected data on human-macaque interactions, animal demographics, and macaque-macaque agonistic and affiliative social interactions. We constructed `human co-interaction networks' based on associations between macaques that interacted with humans within the same time and spatial locations, and social networks based on macaque-macaque allogrooming behaviour, affiliative behaviours of short duration (agonistic support, lip-smacking, silent bare-teeth displays and non-sexual mounting) and proximity. Pre-network permutation tests revealed that, within all macaque groups, specific individuals jointly took risks by repeatedly, consistently co-interacting with humans within and across time and space. GLMMs revealed that macaques' tendencies to co-interact with humans was positively predicted by their tendencies to engage in short-duration affiliative interactions and tolerance of conspecifics, although the latter varied across species (bonnets>rhesus>long-tailed). Male macaques were more likely to co-interact with humans than females. Neither macaques' grooming relationships nor their dominance ranks predicted their tendencies to co-interact with humans. Our findings suggest that, in challenging anthropogenic environments, less (compared to more) time-consuming forms of affiliation, and additionally greater social tolerance in less ecologically flexible species with a shorter history of exposure to humans, may be key to animals' joint propensities to take risks to gain access to resources. For males, greater exploratory tendencies and less energetically demanding long-term life-history strategies (compared to females) may also influence such joint risk-taking. From conservation and public health perspectives, wildlife connectedness within such co-interaction networks may inform interventions to mitigate zoonosis, and move human-wildlife interactions from conflict towards coexistence.","10.1111/1365-2656.13584",NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656","WOS:000692924900001","Ruppert, Nadine/D-7085-2016 Kaburu, Stefano Seraph Kiambi/H-8523-2013 Kodandaramaiah, Ullasa/B-9683-2009","Ruppert, Nadine/0000-0002-9760-0058 ","SEP 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,104

Contact tracing data could also be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set with diagnosed patients as ``nodes{''} and their epidemiological contact as ``edges{''} was created. Directed network perspective was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a ``source patient{''} towards a ``target patient{''}. Network measures of ``degree centrality{''} and ``betweenness centrality{''} were calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27\% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19\% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12) patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients. Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network component analysis identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95\% of total patients (1959) and 68.74\% of epidemiological contacts in the network. Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help improve the contact tracing activities.","10.1186/s12874-020-01119-3","233",NA,"1471-2288","WOS:000573626100001","Muniyandi, Malaisamy/JXL-6039-2024 Muniyandi, Malaisamy/AAF-2076-2021 ","Muniyandi, Malaisamy/0000-0002-1209-4062 senthil, sellappan/0000-0003-1983-7882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,105

The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help ``prove{''} that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.","10.1177/2053951720938405","2053951720938405","2053-9517",NA,"WOS:000554923700001",NA,"Mai, Philip/0000-0002-6950-1220 Gruzd, Anatoliy/0000-0003-2366-5163",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,106

The application of reproducible research principles founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions. We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories: conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results: Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the United States and China were the primary contributors to global coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and relevant research is required.

The Syrian migrants experience multiple uncertainties in their daily lives which are further compounded by multifaceted challenges of the post-disaster environment. Social media was used intensively and with impunity in this environment and thereby provides a window into the explicit and implicit dynamics of daily life after a disaster. We aimed to explore how a post-disaster environment potentially generates new uncertainties or exacerbating pre-existing ones for migrants through social media analysis with an indirect perspective, in the context of 2023-Earthquake in Turkiye and Syrian migrants. MethodsSocial network analysis was used to analyze Twitter-data with the hashtags `Syrian' and `earthquake' during a 10-day period beginning on March 22nd, 2023. We calculated network metrics, including degree-values and betweenness-centrality and clustered the network to understand groups. We analyzed a combination of 27 tweets with summative content analysis using a text analysis tool, to identify the most frequently used words. We identified the main points of each tweet and assessed these as possible contributors to post-disaster uncertainty among migrants by using inductive reasoning. ResultsThere were 1918 Twitter users, 274 tweets, 124 replies and 1726 mentions. Discussions about Syrian migrants and earthquakes were established across various groups (n(groups(edges > 15)) = 16). Certain users had a greater influence on the overall network. The nine most frequently used words were included under uncertainty-related category (n(most\_frequently\_used\_words) = 20); `aid, vote, house, citizen, Afghan, illegal, children, border, and leave'. Nine main points were identified as possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants. ConclusionThe post-disaster environment has the potential to exacerbate existing uncertainties, such as being an undocumented migrant, concerns about deportation and housing, being or having a child, inequality of rights between being a citizen and non-citizen, being in minority within minority, political climate of the host nation and access to education or to generate new ones such equitable distribution of aid, which can lead to poor health outcomes. Recognizing the possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants and addressing probable underlying factors might help to build more resilient and healthy communities.","10.3389/fpubh.2023.1204589","1204589",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:001044932900001","Aktuna, Gamze/A-1491-2019","Aktuna, Gamze/0000-0003-4575-7763",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,110

Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\% of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)).

To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. The low-carbon patent application is an important means to achieve these goals and promote public health. MethodsThis study analyzes the basic situation, spatial network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database. ResultsThe following findings are established. (1) From the number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing. (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including economic development, financial support, local scientific research level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level, the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban agglomerations.

This study examines a subject directory system related to Mental Health in the MedlinePlus portal and provides suggestions of optimisation to enhance the subject directory system. Method. A mixed research method combining social network analysis and inferential statistics was applied. Analysis. A structural and a semantic social network were built regarding the selected health topics related to mental health in the MedlinePlus portal. The two networks were compared and the outcomes were evaluated by domain experts. Results. Among the ninety-nine collected health topics related to mental health, three themes were identified through the visualisation analysis regarding grouped health topics. Patterns and characteristics of each theme group were discussed. As a result, fifty-five bidirectional and twenty-three unidirectional edges were identified and recommended to be added to the corresponding health topic pages. The recommended results indicate that the subject directory of specific mental health related topics is well constructed, while health consumer groups related topics might need more improvements. The optimised subject directory has significantly stronger semantic connection, and the results of the recommendations are consistent with the evaluation outcome of two domain experts. Conclusions. The findings of this study can provide ideas of optimising and enhancing the subject directory system to the public health portal creators and health professionals, and benefit health consumers for seeking health information online. The methodologies applied in this study may provide a novel way to investigate and enhance subject directories in general.","10.47989/irpaper876","876","1368-1613",NA,"WOS:000611778100039","zhu, yifan/JMR-2845-2023 Zhu, Yifan/GXH-6179-2022 ","Zhu, Yifan/0000-0002-3622-2858",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,122

Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing challenges in the development, implementation and evaluation of community pharmacy services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the foundation for building collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care. Objectives: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a collaborative initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in Andalucia (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders, differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder relationships. Method: Stakeholders were identified using the snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders and analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire was sent to 186 stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5) concerns; (6) whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they had with other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive qualitative content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis and social network analysis. Results: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated. The identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public health and science were the main driving interests. A collaboration network existed between the 96 stakeholders. Conclusion: This study revealed the magnitude of the social system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. A large array of stakeholders was identified and analyzed, and a group of critical stakeholders selected. Stakeholder characteristics such as attitude toward the initiative, potential contribution, desire for involvement, and the existing collaboration network, provided complementary information that was helpful for planning the process and stakeholder engagement.","10.1016/j.sapharm.2019.05.008",NA,"1551-7411","1934-8150","WOS:000507925300013","Marques-Sanchez, Pilar/Y-9161-2019 ","Marques-Sanchez, Pilar/0000-0002-1304-1552 Benrimoj, Shalom (charlie)/0000-0001-9768-7838 FRANCO-TRIGO, LUCIA/0000-0001-6833-6035",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,123

Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time. Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated. Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study.

The findings reveal that the small-world pattern and scale-free property of media citation networks contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19-related news around the world. Within the networks, a small number of media outlets from a few countries formed the backbone of the network to control the risk communication; meanwhile, many media of geographical and cultural similarities formed cross-border collaborative cliques in the periphery of the network. When the alert phase escalated from the national level to the global level, the network demonstrated a number of changes.

Mathematical models of transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data. However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within two secondary schools in England and test for associations between self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates from the local community were also sequenced to assess the representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission, increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age children may be an important source of community transmission.","10.1099/mgen.0.000993","000993","2057-5858",NA,"WOS:000974293800001","Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011 Holmes, Mark/JVO-1478-2024 ","Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958 Bellis, Katherine L/0000-0001-5368-7027 Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-5454-1625 Aggarwal, Dinesh/0000-0002-5938-8172",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,127

Social network analysis (SNA) is one mechanism to quantify and understand the factors leading to collaboration and effectiveness within these coalitions. This study aims to investigate network characteristics associated with perceived success and satisfaction in a health coalition and determine significant factors related to organizational collaborations. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the Olympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition (OPHCC) which aims to prevent chronic disease in rural Clallam County, Washington. Representatives (n = 21) from member organizations (n = 18) were asked to report on organization characteristics, perceived satisfaction in coalition activities, perceived success toward coalition's mission, and collaborations with other organizations in the coalition. Multilevel modeling used to analyze whether an organization's position within the coalition network was associated with their perceived satisfaction and perceived success. Exponential random graph modeling was used to examine what factors may impact collaboration ties between coalition members. Findings Organization representatives reported a total of 252 collaboration ties. In multilevel models, organization characteristics and network centrality scores accounted for between 61 and 68\% of variance displayed in satisfaction scores and 45-61\% of variance in perceived success scores. Exponential random graph modeling revealed activity level, for-profit status, and transitivity as significant factors in collaborative tie presence. Originality/value Encouraging consistent active participation, a balance of organizational type, and projects which require more than two collaborators may provide an environment for collaborative ties between organizations.","10.1108/JHOM-04-2020-0120",NA,"1477-7266","1758-7247","WOS:000576388300001","Patterson, Megan/U-5546-2018 ","Patterson, Megan/0000-0001-6876-2931 Prochnow, Tyler/0000-0001-7886-4456","OCT 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,129

Leveraging systems science methods offers opportunities to approach PA in a manner which embraces its inherent complexity. This study describes how participatory systems mapping and social network analysis (SNA) were used to understand the work of local and national level walking systems in Ireland. Methods Two adapted participatory action research workshops with multisectoral stakeholders were used to develop a systems map for walking in Cork, Ireland. The Global Action Plan for Physical Activity 2018-2030 (GAPPA) map was used as a framework to categorize workshop outcomes. Secondly, SNA methods were used to analyse the communication network between partners of Get Ireland Walking, a national walking promotion initiative, as defined within their strategic plan and the actual communication network as experienced by the partners. Results The systems mapping process allowed stakeholders to identify 19 suggested actions for the Cork walking system. The SNA found that there were considerably fewer communication ties between partners in the actual communication network than in the strategy defined network. Conclusion The systems mapping process was a useful catalyst for engaging stakeholders in cross-sectoral communication and the GAPPA was a practical way to organize workshop outcomes. Social network analysis methods highlighted that the communication network of a national level walking promotion partnership is not working as planned. Overall, the use of systems science methods can provide practical insights for local and national level walking systems.","10.1093/eurpub/ckac076",NA,"1101-1262","1464-360X","WOS:000848634100003",NA,"Lambe, Barry/0000-0002-8876-3189 Murphy, Niamh/0000-0002-0176-2897 Power, Dylan/0000-0001-6829-2757",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,130

May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the event had primary involvement from the United States and the United Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents, especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally. The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and global health.","10.7759/cureus.28997","e28997",NA,"2168-8184","WOS:000856781800007","Malhotra, Kashish/ABT-8009-2022 ","Malhotra, Kashish/0000-0002-6985-5731 Goyal, Kashish/0000-0002-6997-7691",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,134

Research on dietary factors related to MetS has attracted considerable attention in the recent decades. However, the research hotspots, knowledge structure, and theme trends for the dietary factors associated with MetS remain unknown, and have not yet been systematically mapped. This study aimed to review the research status of diet as a risk factor for MetS through bibliometric methods. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science database. Research hotspots were identified using biclustering analysis with the gCLUTO software, and knowledge structure was explored via social network analysis using the Ucinet software. Theme trends were investigated using evolutionary analysis with the SciMAT software. In total, 1,305 papers were analyzed. The research output on the dietary factors associated with MetS increased steadily. The research scope was gradually expanding and diverse. Overall, eight research hot spots, four key dietary nodes, and four motor themes on the dietary factors associated with MetS were identified. Fatty acids, dietary fiber, and polyphenols have been the focus of research in this field over the years. Evolutionary analysis showed that fish oil and vitamin C were well-developed research foci recently. Prebiotics was recognized as an emerging theme with certain developmental potential. These findings provide a better understanding of the research status of the dietary factors associated with MetS and a reference for future investigations.","10.3389/fnut.2021.655533","655533","2296-861X",NA,"WOS:000661012700001","wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023 liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023 Wu, Lijuan/JJG-0701-2023 Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023 li, Li/JPA-0218-2023 zhou, xian/JYQ-9844-2024 Wang, Guanhua/JXM-6373-2024 Zhang, Tie-Ning/GPK-5202-2022 XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023 liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023 Liu, Kai/IST-6808-2023 wen, Wen/KBB-1727-2024 chen, yuying/JNS-9778-2023 Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023 ","Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156 Wu, Qi-Jun/0000-0001-9421-5114 Zhang, Tie-Ning/0000-0003-4954-5370 cao, xia/0000-0001-9228-276X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,137

When carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's structure, and the centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure of the enforcement network became flatter, with a horizontal' management arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy implementation.","10.3390/su11020340","340",NA,"2071-1050","WOS:000457129900044","3107-2022 ","0000-0001-9631-9283 wu, jian nan/0000-0003-1795-7266",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,138

We used a mixed-methods approach to assess collaborative relationships between multiple government sectors and civil society and to suggest possible health promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the urban poor in deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in health promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods. Participants included stakeholders working for or engaging in governments (3), public health care institutions (5), social service providers (3), community-based organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based organisations (3). We conducted semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and then collected survey data. Quantitative data were analysed using social network analysis, and qualitative data were analysed through iterative and consensus processes. The social network analysis indicated that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and controlling informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and communication, (2) need of a coalition with a committed leading actor for future collaboration and (3) organisational and political silos within and across public sectors. Increased understanding of the current status of and challenges to collaboration can inform the planning and implementation of complex intervening strategies and policies tailored to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods.

We aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA. Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms. Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201, 100\%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6\%) and popularity (n=110, 54.7\%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for `similarity on popularity' (within the `similarity' category) to 28 for the `characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and nominated peers' (within the `nature of the relationships' category). Using the examples of `social isolation', `group membership', `individuals in a central position' (within the `position within the network' category) and `nominations of influential peers' (sub within the `popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public health intervention based on SNA.","10.1136/jech-2023-220980",NA,"0143-005X","1470-2738","WOS:001153345300001",NA,NA,"JAN 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,140

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. Methods In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. Results A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. Conclusion Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as usual.","10.5888/pcd18.200536","200536","1545-1151",NA,"WOS:000626189400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,145

To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel multivariate spatio-network model for jointly modelling all three of these behaviours, with inference conducted in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model is motivated by survey data from five schools in Los Angeles, California, and the results indicate the important roles that individual factors and friendship networks play in driving the uptake of these health behaviours.","10.1111/rssc.12531",NA,"0035-9254","1467-9876","WOS:000722928100001","Lee, Duncan/HPH-6789-2023 ","Gerogiannis, George/0000-0001-6067-0047","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,150

AIANs have the highest suicide rate compared to all other ethnic groups in the United States. Social relations are a salient fixture of AIAN culture. The primary aims of this study were to describe the personal networks of AI youth that have recently had a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation and to identify key network differences between the two groups. This study uses personal networks collected among AIs living on a reservation in the Southwest. Our sample included 46 American Indians that have recently attempted suicide or had suicidal ideation. We explored social network characteristics of the two groups descriptively as well as comparatively (t-tests). Our findings suggest that AI youth that have attempted suicide nominate more friends in their networks that have used alcohol and drugs compared to the networks of AI youth that have recent suicide ideation. Additionally, AI youth that recently attempted suicide have used alcohol and drugs with their network peers at a higher rate than youth that have had recent suicide ideation. Lastly, AI youth that have attempted suicide recently were significantly more likely to have more nominated friends in their networks that they had reached out to when they were struggling with suicide compared to their peers that have experienced recent suicide ideation. These results indicate a promising method moving forward to identify unique intervention strategies that extend beyond the individual.","10.1007/s10597-021-00857-y",NA,"0010-3853","1573-2789","WOS:000668801600001",NA,"Waugh, Emma/0000-0001-8248-3859 Ivanich, Jerreed D./0000-0002-0794-4835","JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,152

This is demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service, funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A description of the system thinking methodology and its associated methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft system methodology are described with examples in the health care setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However, many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care. Conclusion: It is important that methods to implement systems thinking methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.","10.1097/XEB.0000000000000303",NA,"2691-3321",NA,"WOS:000783723400002","khalil, hanan/AAX-4188-2021","khalil, hanan/0000-0002-3302-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,154

One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.","10.7717/peerj.14305","e14305","2167-8359",NA,"WOS:000965008100001","MacIntosh, Andrew/B-2242-2013","Castellano-Navarro, Alba/0000-0001-7608-2776 MacIntosh, Andrew/0000-0002-9136-7099",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,155

Complex interventions are intentional processes designed to shift and realign the form and function of targeted system patterns by changing underlying system dynamics, structures, and conditions. The IM40 initiative was a complex health promotion intervention designed to address adolescent health and well-being through a developmental assets approach. The initiative sought to influence several levels simultaneously (e.g. individual, professional, procedural, and policy), compounding the complexity for implementation and evaluation. The purpose of this case study is to present the development and initiation of an evaluation approach based on systems thinking and complexity science principles, concepts, and methods. We used three systems methods, Group Model Building (GMB), viable systems model (VSM) assessment, and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify and examine underlying patterns and structures that influenced system-wide behaviors. Each method focused on a general systems-oriented question and illuminated stakeholder views of the IM40 theory of change, adaptive organization of multiple independent institutions, and relational ties among system actors. Collectively, the methods enabled us to describe systems change over time and examine shifts in boundaries, relationships, perspectives, and dynamics. The implications of this approach relative to typical evaluation activities in public health practice are contrasted and discussed.","10.1080/09581596.2018.1455966",NA,"0958-1596","1469-3682","WOS:000462311300008",NA,"Knight, Erin/0000-0003-2130-9480",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,156

However, conventional prevention and control strategies, which only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently decrease the number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode is needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to analyze how these social organizations cooperate with others and further identify the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of the actor's attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220 participants in 19 social organizations. The results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the network between social organizations became more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and e/s > 2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all except the ``same age group effect (-1.02){''}. The results also indicated that the social organizations tend to build relationships with more active actors in the community in every time period. This paper is of great significance regarding the innovation of public health system management and the improvement of Chinese grassroots governance.","10.3390/ijerph20021409","1409",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000915064400001","Zhou, Dan/AAG-4315-2020","Zhou, Dan/0000-0001-8941-4223",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,159

Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19. Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted. Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative.

With the greater uptake of orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable. This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects adolescents' social position in their peer networks using cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about their social relationships in school. These directed network data were used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19\% of the surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology, epidemiology and medicine.","10.1007/s00056-023-00506-x",NA,"1434-5293","1615-6714","WOS:001127631200001",NA,NA,"DEC 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,164

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language.

To date, no network of a health-promoting university has been examined regarding the processes underlying tie formation, network emergence, and maintenance.Objectives and methods The goals of this study are to obtain insight into the mechanisms of cooperation between university actors in a health-promoting network and to identify the structural and attributive factors associated with establishing cooperation between actors in the observed network in order to better understand how to build and develop successful networks in the future. For this purpose, a social network analysis was carried out and exponential random graph models were estimated to test corresponding hypotheses.Results The network at hand consists of 33 actors (e.g. University Sports Center, General Student Committee) and shows a flat, non-hierarchical structure. Data reveal that attributed competence predicts cooperation (0.32; p < 0.05). Significant homophily effects among student actors (1.31; p < 0.05) and among university actors (0.59; p < 0.05) were found. All structural predictors examined were significant (0.22-5.40; p < 0.05) and are therefore essential in determining the likelihood of cooperation between actors involved in the network.Conclusion The results of this study provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cooperation and can be used to further develop the network at hand (e.g. selection of key actors for information dissemination or integration of peripheral actors). In addition, the findings offer starting points for sustained network development at other universities (e.g. significance of network governance form or goal consensus). Knowing the factors that influence the network structure, here the conditions of cooperation, results in opportunities to encourage empowerment among actors. However, the analysis of the network undertaken does not directly bear on the success of the network.","10.1186/s12889-023-16786-2","1911",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:001076952500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,168

Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia.

Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683","105683","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000833401100005","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Dietze, Klaas/JJF-6743-2023 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Dietze, Klaas/0000-0002-6138-6707 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

By analyzing different patterns of normative influence associated with cervical cancer detection among Latinas (N = 982), the study concludes that network brokerage provides individuals with nonredundant information, helps resist normative pressure, and contributes to efficacy beliefs, promoting more informed decision making. Conversely, network closure perpetuates conformity, increases the influence of social norms, and induces less confidence in individual's ability to comply with cervical cancer screening, subjecting Latinas to unnecessary health risks. Overall, the results suggest that the study of normative influence should be combined with social network analysis, trying to shed a light on the distinct social structures and communication practices that can either reinforce or challenge norms.

To understand the alignment and structure of each network, we measured network density overall and between sectors, network centralization, and each organization's degree centrality and effective size.Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted to document alignment around shared purpose, data, financing, and governance.Principal Findings: On average, overall and cross-sector network densities in both communities were similar. However, alignment was highest for data sharing and financing in the urban community and for shared purpose and governance in the rural community. Cross-sector partnerships involving healthcare organizations were more prevalent in the rural county (44\% vs. 38\% for healthcare/public health, 44\% vs. 29\% for healthcare/social services), but more prevalent for those involving public health/social services organizations in the urban county (42\% vs. 24\%). A single healthcare organization had the highest degree centrality (Mdn {[}IQR] = 26 [}26-9.5]) and effective size (Mdn {[}IQR] = 15.9 {[}20.6-8.7]) within the rural county. Social services organizations held more central positions in the urban county (degree centrality Mdn {[}IQR] = 13 [}14.8-9.5]; effective size Mdn {[}IQR] = 10.4 [}11.4-7.9]).Conclusions: Cross-sector alignment may strengthen local capacity for comprehensive SUD care for pregnant and parenting women. Healthcare organizations are key players in cross-sector partnerships in the rural community, where one healthcare facility holds the central brokerage role. In contrast, public health agencies are key to cross-sector collaboration with social services in the urban community.","10.1111/1475-6773.14251",NA,"0017-9124","1475-6773","WOS:001085329800001",NA,"Feygin, Yana/0000-0002-3192-5677 Davis, Deborah/0000-0002-5943-3877","OCT 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,175

Some are new risks from urban construction, while some are traditional risks that belong to this coastal area. The joint efforts of these risks may lead to new hazards, harming public health, but this problem has not been noticed in previous studies. Therefore, this study constructs the Triangular Framework for Safety Risk in New Towns to identify the risks and proposes strategies to reduce the risks. In this study, multiple methods are integrated, including Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Social Network Analysis (SNA). This study takes the Lin-gang Special Area in China as a case study to verify the framework's effectiveness. Sixteen disaster-causing factors are identified, and the internal linkages among these factors are clarified. Results show that the hybrid method performs well in quantitatively analyzing the risk factors of new coastal towns. A typhoon, public risk perception, and population migration are essential influencing factors. Disaster prevention capability of high-rise buildings, disaster prevention capacity of port facilities, and transportation are the most direct influencing factors. Environmental degradation is the most conductive among all elements. This study contributes to the theoretical theory by proposing an effective framework to analyze the safety risks in new coastal towns.

Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. Methods This paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors. Results The results show that commercial actors' positions on e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs, independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Conclusion Awareness of the various commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3.","10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056084",NA,"0964-4563","1468-3318","WOS:000728273000001",NA,"Hilton, Shona/0000-0003-0633-8152 Wong, Mark Tsun On/0000-0002-5683-8684 Buckton, Christina/0000-0002-6004-4334 Ikegwuonu, Theresa/0000-0001-6633-8512 Smith, Katherine/0000-0002-1060-4102","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,179

Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and ``alternative facts.{''","10.1371/journal.pone.0261811","e0261811","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000988228800001",NA,"Scheutz, Matthias/0000-0002-0064-2789 Rabb, Nicholas/0000-0002-6362-0448",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,193

To tackle this problem, we construct consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model.

Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term goal is to use risk-based information from empirical socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors. Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2) evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission of S aureus. Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history, etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S aureus transmission. Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on the original funded design for this project (\#NIH U54MD012388). That design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337 individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined data monitoring procedures. Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of S aureus carriage and transmission.","10.2196/14853","e14853","1929-0748",NA,"WOS:000488621400005","Pearson, Talima/O-7840-2019 Barger, Steven D./I-3724-2012 Lininger, Monica/N-4833-2015","Pearson, Talima/0000-0003-3696-041X Wayment, Heidi A./0000-0001-5287-5966 Hepp, Crystal/0000-0002-0612-3648 Kyman, Shari/0000-0001-5386-5866 Villa, Francisco/0000-0002-0522-7576 Hurtado, Kevin/0000-0002-8237-414X Barger, Steven D./0000-0002-8296-0974 Lininger, Monica/0000-0001-6221-0642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,199

In this paper we propose a generic model of step-growth polymerisation as a promising application of the percolation on a directed random graph. This polymerisation process is used to manufacture a broad range of polymeric materials, including: polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, and many others. We link features of step-growth polymerisation to the properties of the directed configuration model. In this way, we obtain new analytical expressions describing the polymeric microstructure and compare them to data from experiments and computer simulations. The molecular weight distribution is related to the sizes of connected components, gelation to the emergence of the giant component, and the molecular gyration radii to the Wiener index of these components. A model on this level of generality is instrumental in accelerating the design of new materials and optimizing their properties, as well as it provides a vital link between network science and experimentally observable physics of polymers.","10.1038/s41598-018-37942-4","2276","2045-2322",NA,"WOS:000459092800046","Kryven, Ivan/X-3284-2019 ","Kryven, Ivan/0000-0002-3964-2196 Schamboeck, Verena/0000-0001-8357-2204",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,201

All three networks are ``small worlds{''} characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students are connected through multiple independent paths. Hybrid models of instruction can reduce but not eliminate the potential for epidemic spread through the small worlds of course enrollments.","10.15195/v7.a9",NA,NA,"2330-6696","WOS:000537487200001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,203

We examine implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) adopted by the World Health Organization in 2003 and ratified by approximately 94\% of countries as of 2016. We constructed five networks: (1) geographic distance, (2) general trade, (3) tobacco trade, (4) GLOBALink referrals, and (5) GLOBALink co-subscriptions. Network exposure terms were constructed from these networks based on the implementation scores for six articles of the FCTC treaty. We estimate effects using a lagged Type 1 Tobit model. Results show that network effects were significant: (a) across all networks for article 6 (pricing and taxation), (b) distance, general trade, GL referrals, and GL co-subscriptions for article 8 (second hand smoke), (c) distance, general trade, and GL co-subscriptions for article 11 (packaging and labeling), and (d) distance and GL co-subscription for article 13 (promotion and advertising), (e) tobacco trade and GL co-subscriptions for article 14 (cessation). These results indicate that diffusion effects were more prevalent for pricing and taxation as well as restrictions on smoking in public places and packaging and labeling. These results suggest that network influences are possible in domains that are amenable to control by national governments but unlikely to occur in domains established by existing regulatory systems. Implications for future studies of policy implementation are discussed.","10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.01.008",NA,"0277-9536",NA,"WOS:000459838900021",NA,"Valente, Thomas/0000-0002-8824-5816 Vega Yon, George/0000-0002-3171-0844",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,205

To date, there is limited evidence on how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and physical activity providers as well as sports administrating organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations; Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central actors (preferential attachment effect). Organizations from different sectors cooperated more often than organizations from the same sector (heterophily effect). Conclusion: The study provided valid and robust findings on significant mechanisms and conditions of interorganizational cooperation in community networks focused on sport and physical activity promotion. Based on the results, implications for the development and most efficient governance of these networks can be derived.","10.1186/s12889-022-14383-3","1966",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000873884600002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,209

We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was applied to test the association between network measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters, yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are warranted.","10.1017/ice.2022.102","PII S0899823X22001027","0899-823X","1559-6834","WOS:000786487300001",NA,"Darkoh, Charles/0000-0003-0063-7856 Tadese, Bekana/0000-0001-5173-5427","APR 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,211

The scientific aim of this study was to introduce geospatial thinking to research related to infectious diseases, while the practical aim was to explore the impact on population movements and urban linkages in the longer term following a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study took 366 cities in China as the research subjects while exploring the relationship between urban contact and the outbreak of the pandemic from both national and regional perspectives using social network analysis (SNA), Pearson correlation analysis and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) modeling. The results revealed that the number of COVID-19 infections in China fluctuated with strain variation over the study period; the urban contact network exhibited a significant trend of recovery. The pandemic had a hindering effect on national urban contact, and this effect weakened progressively. Meanwhile, the effect exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with a weakening effect in the eastern region \& AP; northeast region > central region > western region, indicating a decreasing phenomenon from coastal to inland areas. Moreover, the four major economic regions in China featured border barrier effects, whereby urban contact networks constituted by cross-regional flows were more sensitive to the development of the pandemic. The geostatistical approach adopted in this study related to infectious disease and urban linkages can be used in other regions, and its findings provide a reference for China and other countries around the world to respond to major public health events.","10.3390/ijgi12060252","252",NA,"2220-9964","WOS:001015242400001","Wang, Yanan/JVZ-7957-2024 wang, xueting/JPY-2782-2023 liu, sha/JXL-6600-2024 lin, yuan/JXL-9592-2024 Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023 Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020 zhao, sheng/JWO-6127-2024 Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023 Liu, Jingyi/JWP-6326-2024 Liu, Liu/JXM-8208-2024 Liu, Haimeng/R-7364-2018","Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017 Miao, Yi/0000-0003-3829-9557 Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,213

We provide a case study of systems science application to address geographic CVD health disparities at the community level - informing the science of CVD health disparities research. MethodsWe conducted a two-phased, multi-methods needs assessment in the Denver, Colorado area. Phase I consisted of a social network analysis to map a two-mode network of existing CVD prevention interventions and their implementing organizations. In Phase II, group model building (GMB) sessions with key community, public health, and healthcare provider stakeholders, were utilized to identify and visualize community factors contributing to disparities in CVD risk, producing a consensus-based causal loop diagram. ResultsBetween May 2021 and June 2022, we conducted 24 virtual, semi-structured interviews in Phase I to describe CVD prevention interventions, and 7 virtual GMB sessions in Phase II to describe experiences of disparities in CVD risk.

The authors examined the associations of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are important to assess the direction of the association between social isolation and cognitive performance.

However, whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated with future hallucinatory experiences. Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory experiences three years later than children who were not involved in bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim = 1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012).

Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory experiences in pre-adolescence.

Records from each database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focusof patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.","10.1186/s12889-019-6842-x","530",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000467609400002","FONSECA, FERNANDA/HDN-9451-2022 Fonseca, Fernanda/V-3446-2019 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/AAD-8584-2020 ","FONSECA, FERNANDA/0000-0002-0315-6479 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/0000-0002-4135-4011 Guindalini, Camila/0000-0002-6278-5881 Fonseca, Bruna de Paula/0000-0002-8795-2578 Fonseca, Fernanda/0000-0001-6852-6912",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,224

Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board, the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics boards of each participating study centre. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.","10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055664","e055664","2044-6055",NA,"WOS:000760351500014","Grimshaw, Jeremy/D-8726-2013 Cohen, Eyal/K-2575-2014 Taljaard, Monica/AFJ-8820-2022","Hayeems, Robin/0000-0003-3269-8004 Chow, Andrea/0000-0003-1683-2912 Potter, Murray/0000-0003-0577-362X Taljaard, Monica/0000-0002-3978-8961",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,227

Chinese OHCs are no exception. However, user-generated content (UGC) and the associated user behaviors in Chinese OHCs are largely underexplored and rarely analyzed systematically, forfeiting valuable opportunities for optimizing treatment design and care delivery with insights gained from OHCs. Objective: This study aimed to reveal both the shared and distinct characteristics of 2 popular OHCs in China by systematically and comprehensively analyzing their UGC and the associated user behaviors. Methods: We concentrated on studying the lung cancer forum (LCF) and breast cancer forum (BCF) on Mijian, and the diabetes consultation forum (DCF) on Sweet Home, because of the importance of the 3 diseases among Chinese patients and their prevalence on Chinese OHCs in general. Our analysis explored the key user activities, small-world effect, and scale-free characteristics of each social network. We examined the UGC of these forums comprehensively and adopted the weighted knowledge network technique to discover salient topics and latent relations among these topics on each forum. Finally, we discussed the public health implications of our analysis findings. Results: Our analysis showed that the number of reads per thread on each forum followed gamma distribution (H-L=0, H-B=0, and H-D=0); the number of replies on each forum followed exponential distribution (adjusted R-L(2) =0.946, adjusted R-B(2)=0.958, and adjusted R-D(2) =0.971); and the number of threads a user is involved with (adjusted R-L(2)=0.978, adjusted R-B(2)=0.964, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.970), the number of followers of a user (adjusted R-L(2)=0.989, adjusted R-B(2)=0.962, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.990), and a user's degrees (adjusted R-L(2)=0.997, adjusted R-B(2)=0.994, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.968) all followed power-law distribution. The study further revealed that users are generally more active during weekdays, as commonly witnessed in all 3 forums. In particular, the LCF and DCF exhibited high temporal similarity (rho=0.927; P<.001) in terms of the relative thread posting frequencies during each hour of the day. Besides, the study showed that all 3 forums exhibited the small-world effect (mean sigma(L)=517.15, mean sigma(B)=275.23, and mean sigma(D)=525.18) and scale-free characteristics, while the global clustering coefficients were lower than those of counterpart international OHCs. The study also discovered several hot topics commonly shared among the 3 disease forums, such as disease treatment, disease examination, and diagnosis. In particular, the study found that after the outbreak of COVID-19, users on the LCF and BCF were much more likely to bring up COVID-19-related issues while discussing their medical issues. Conclusions: UGC and related online user behaviors in Chinese OHCs can be leveraged as important sources of information to gain insights regarding individual and population health conditions. Effective and timely mining and utilization of such content can continuously provide valuable firsthand clues for enhancing the situational awareness of health providers and policymakers.","10.2196/19183","e19183","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000740354600002",NA,"ZHOU, Linyun/0000-0001-6500-537X Lei, Yuqi/0000-0001-6984-9609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,229

Greater understanding of these relationships could help inform healthy weight promoting interventions. We conducted a feasibility study among youth at risk of obesity to document process outcomes, to discern relationships between PSN features and weight-related behaviors, and to generate hypotheses with respect to perceived social support (SS) and sex. Methods: Participants (egos) nominated up to 10 people (alters) with whom they discussed important matters. Egos reported their own and each alter's age, sex, body shape, lifestyle behaviors, relation, frequency of exercising with each alter, and of being encouraged by each alter to exercise. We examined relationships between PSN features and weight-related outcomes and explored the role of SS, using both correlational and linear regression analyses. Results: There were 45 participants (mean age 16.4 years) and body mass index z-score (zBMI) ranged from -1.2 to 3.9. There were few missing responses to PSN items; broad variation across most items, including SS scores, was reported. Correlations pointed to plausible relationships implicating PSN features and lifestyle behaviors. In exploratory analyses, network-based SS was positively associated with adiposity in girls and negatively associated in boys, while lifestyle role modelling was not associated with adiposity. Conclusions: Our findings support the feasibility of measuring the PSN in youth and the potential for using social network analysis to investigate social and behavioral mechanisms associated with obesity.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States","adolescents; physical activity; social network analysis; social support; weight status","en",NA,NA,NA,233

Social network factors influence health behaviors and are important contributors to the obesity epidemic. The objective of this study was to describe social networks and obesity-related characteristics among adult Somali immigrants in a Minnesota city in order to inform a community-based, participatory, research-derived, social network intervention to decrease obesity rates. METHODS: Survey data (demographics, general health measures, and sociobehavioral and network measures) and height and weight measures (for calculating body mass index) were collected from adult Somali immigrants by bilingual study team members at community locations. Descriptive statistics were used to report the survey and biometric data. Logistic regression models were used to describe the basic associations of participants and network factors. Network data were analyzed to identify nodes and ties, to visualize the network, and to identify potential interventionists for a future social network intervention. RESULTS: Of the 646 participants, 50\% were overweight or affected by obesity. The network had 1703 nodes with 3583 ties between nodes, and modularity was high (0.75). Compared with respondents of normal weight, participants who were overweight or affected by obesity had more network members who were also overweight or obese (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95\% CI, 1.11-7.56; P = .03); this was most notable for men (OR, 4.58; 95\% CI, 1.22-17.22; P = .02) and suggestive for those 50 years or older (OR, 24.23; 95\% CI, 1.55-377.83; P = .03). Weight loss intention among participants who were overweight or affected by obesity was associated with number of family members and friends trying to lose weight, enabling functional network factors (social norms for weight loss, social support for healthy eating, and social cohesion), and less favorable obesogenic social norms. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample of Somali immigrants, distinct social networks are clustered by weight status, and social contacts and functional network characteristics are related to individuals' weight loss intentions. These factors should be considered in weight loss interventions and programs. A social network intervention targeting weight loss, within a community-based participatory research framework, is feasible in this vulnerable population.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Community-based participatory research; Immigrants; Obesity; Refugees; Social network analysis; Somali","en",NA,NA,NA,235

The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes-and the role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using device-level geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and find that 5.1\% of smartphone users who visited a nursing home for at least 1 h also visited another facility during our 11-wk study period-even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 7.1 other facilities.

Some employed ethnography, qualitative interviews, or were simply reviews. Most syndemic co-factors were substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, depression, intimate partner violence, stigma, sexually transmitted infections, and trauma and non-communicable diseases. Half of the studies were conducted in the United States and mostly in urban areas. Other contexts were Canada, Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Botswana, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, China, Peru, and Romania. SUMMARY: Most recommendations suggested that people living with HIV need interventions that address other factors situated within their life, such as their mental health, social stigma, experiences of trauma and intimate partner violence, and social stigma and sexual risk taking. Many took an intersectoral approach and emphasized the need to consider the various factors that shape experiences with HIV, from sex, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity, and past trauma.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,241

In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate to each other and call for a complexity science approach to advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in 191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs. We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time. We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling) could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens in an urban context.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,242

Reasons for that increase remain unclear, but the inter-organizational arrangement of organ donation programs may have contributed. However, there is a paucity of literature investigating these inter-organizational arrangements, with a limited understanding of how communication facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may help to re-establish rising organ donation rates post-pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe interprofessional interactions of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) during organ donation cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, from an organizational perspective (describing structure, context, process). METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA) approach analyzing 14 organ donation cases just before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social network graphs depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with a great part of the communication being processed through the OTDC. CONTEXT: Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across cases, and health care professionals perceived an atmosphere of shared vision and trust among team members. PROCESS: Most networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a decentralized information flow, and participants perceived decisions being jointly made. The characteristic path length of cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, suggesting potential for rapid information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced the OTDC role of intermediator within the communication process, and hospital staff perceived OTDCs as central players.

An understanding of livestock movement patterns is needed to understand national transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that helps to describe the relationships among individuals and the implications of those relationships. We used SNA to describe the contact structure of livestock movements throughout the contiguous U.S. from April 1(st), 2015 to March 31(st), 2016. We describe 4 network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminant. Livestock movement data were sourced from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) while county-level farm demographic data were from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described networks, nodes are represented by counties and arcs by shipments between nodes; the networks were weighted based on the number of shipments between nodes. For the analyses, movement data were aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. Measures of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification of trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the study period, a total of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef cattle movements accounted for 63 \% of all movements. At least 70 \% of U.S. counties were present in each of the networks, but the density of arcs was less than 2\% in all networks. In the beef cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly correlated (0.8) with the number of beef cows per county while for the dairy cattle network a strong correlation (>0.86) was found with the number of dairy cattle per km(2) at the county level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large communities (50 counties or more per community), and were geographically clustered except for the communities in the small ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses can help to understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants.

METHODS: A cohort of 124,691 women aged 15-70 with an ED visit for aggression between 2003 and 2015 was selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and traumas was reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses and traumas, including also 9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA community detection algorithms and network centrality measures were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly associated to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the capability of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of having an history of violence. Model results were summed up into a risk chart. RESULTS: Among women experiencing an aggression, SNA identified four communities representing specific violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a central role in the violence network were alcohol or substance abuse, pregnancy-related conditions and psychoses. These high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 20\% of our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and predictive power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified through the SNA are meaningful in the violence recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women. Increasing the available number of predictors, such procedures may be proven to support ED staff in identifying early signs of violence to adequately support the victims and mitigate the harms.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Emergency department; First line screening; Gender-based violence; Patterns of diagnoses; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,251

However, stability of the network centrality was low (expected influence stability = 0.52). The node with the greatest increase in expected influence within the network was miscellaneous ``in-passing'' exposure. In-passing exposure is an understudied exposure medium.

In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. METHODS: Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61\% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION: Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,259

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest hospital outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA). METHODS: We constructed a directed relational network and calculated network metrics for 'degree', 'betweenness', 'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network components and modularity to identify sub-network structures with disproportionately big effects. RESULTS: We detected 68 connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 27 (58.7\%) were ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2\%) caregivers, 6 (13\%) patients and 2 (4.4\%) nurses. Among the 10 most important cases selected by each SNA network metric, transmission dynamics clustered in 17 cases, of whom 12 (70.6\%) cases were ancillary support staff. Ancillary support staff also constituted 71.1\% of cases in the dominant sub-network and 68.8\% of cases in the three largest sub-communities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified non-clinical ancillary support staff, who are responsible for room service and food distribution in hospital wards in Vietnam, as a group with disproportionally big impacts on transmission dynamics during this outbreak.

Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the driving factors of the social rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 1,537 rumors collected from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided the sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation analysis were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics and the spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of the rumors, and the four stages of development were also divided according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network analysis method was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode network characteristics, the generation driver-rumor 2-mode network characteristics, and the spreading driver-rumor 2-mode characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results of rumor drivers indicated that panic psychology and the lag in releasing government information played an essential role in driving the generation and spread of rumors. The public's low scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors. CONCLUSION: The study revealed the mechanism of rumors. In addition, studies involving rumors on different emergencies and social platforms are warranted to enrich the findings.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","COVID-19 pandemic; network characteristics; rumor; spatial and temporal characteristics; time evolution characteristics","en",NA,NA,NA,263

This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of non-work-related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19.

Understanding how immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents are developing a sense of their national identity and the role that this plays in how they select their friends and are influenced by their friends is essential for developing a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent development in context. The current study used longitudinal social network analysis to examine the interplay of national identity development and friendship network dynamics among immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents in Greece (N = 1252; 46\% female). All youth with higher national identity resolution (i.e., youth's sense of clarity regarding their identity as a member of Greek society) in Grade 8 were more often nominated as a friend in Grade 9. During the transition from 8th to 9th grade, all youth became more similar to their nominated friends in terms of their Greek national identity exploration (i.e., degree to which they had engaged in activities to learn more about Greek society). During the transition from 7th to 8th grade, there was significant variability in peer selection on national identity exploration and resolution between immigrant and non-immigrant youth. Specifically, immigrant youth demonstrated selection effects consistent with notions of homophily, such that they were more likely to nominate peers in 8th grade whose levels of national identity exploration and resolution were similar to their own when in 7th grade. In contrast, non-immigrant youth preferred peers in 8th grade with low levels of national identity exploration (regardless of their own levels of exploration in 7th grade) and peers whose levels of national identity resolution in 8th grade were different from their own in 7th grade (e.g., non-immigrant youth who reported high national identity resolution in 7th grade were more likely to nominate peers who had low national identity resolution in 8th grade). There were no differences by immigrant status in peer influence, suggesting that the significant peer influence effects that emerged during the transition from 8th to 9th grade in which youth became more similar to their friends in national identity exploration may reflect a universal process. These results chart new directions in understanding contemporary youth development in context by showing that adolescents develop their national identity and friendships in tandem and that certain aspects of this process may vary by immigrant status.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,267

METHODS: We assessed the association between social network characteristics and prevalent tuberculosis infection among residents (aged $\geq$15 years) of 9 rural communities in Eastern Uganda. Social contacts named during a census were used to create community-specific nonhousehold social networks. We evaluated whether social network structure and characteristics of first-degree contacts (sex, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, tuberculosis infection) were associated with revalent tuberculosis infection (positive tuberculin skin test [TST] result) after adjusting for individual-level risk factors (age, sex, HIV status, tuberculosis contact, wealth, occupation, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin [BCG] vaccination) with targeted maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS: Among 3 335 residents sampled for TST, 32\% had a positive TST results and 4\% reported a tuberculosis contact. The social network contained 15 328 first-degree contacts.

We used static and temporal network approaches to describe pig trade in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of node-loyalty, resilience of outgoing contact chains, and communities. Two indexes were implemented, the first one is a normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures and other index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized by a municipality to target and rank surveillance activities. Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in that 80 \% of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were found. The results also showed that premises were highly connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 \% of the paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which accounted for the order in which edges occurred.

Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships. However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic. This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities. The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective. The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le{\'o}n, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence. The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to ``track'' contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data. The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players. Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection. The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network. Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be described on the basis of aspects of similarities between students, and even leaders connecting the cohabitation sub-networks. In this context, Social Network Analysis could be considered as a methodological approach for future network studies in health emergency contexts.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,286

The forwarding behavior of social media users on posts concerned with COVID-19 vaccine topics can rapidly disseminate vaccine information in a short period, which has a significant effect on transmission and helps the public access relevant information. However, the factors of social media users' forwarding posts are still uncertain thus far. In this paper, we investigated the factors of the forwarding COVID-19 vaccines Weibo posts on Chinese social media and verified the correlation between social network characteristics, Weibo textual sentiment characteristics, and post forwarding. METHODS: This paper used data mining, machine learning, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis. Using `` (COVID-19 vaccine)'' as the keyword, we used data mining to crawl 121,834 Weibo posts on Sina Weibo from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2021. Weibo posts not closely correlated with the topic of the COVID-19 vaccines were filtered out using machine learning. In the end, 3,158 posts were used for data analysis. The proportions of positive sentiment and negative sentiment in the textual of Weibo posts were calculated through sentiment analysis. On that basis, the sentiment characteristics of Weibo posts were determined. The social network characteristics of information transmission on the COVID-19 vaccine topic were determined through social network analysis. The correlation between social network characteristics, sentiment characteristics of the text, and the forwarding volume of posts was verified through regression analysis. RESULTS: The results suggest that there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of posting users in the social network structure and the amount of forwarding. The relationship between the closeness centrality and the forwarding volume was significantly positive. The betweenness centrality was significantly positively correlated with the forwarding volume. There was no significant relationship between the number of posts containing more positive sentiments and the forwarding volume of posts. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts containing more negative sentiments and the forwarding volume. CONCLUSION: According to the characteristics of users, COVID-19 vaccine posts from opinion leaders, ``gatekeepers,'' and users with high-closeness centrality are more likely to be reposted. Users with these characteristics should be valued for their important role in disseminating information about COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the sentiment contained in the Weibo post is an important factor influencing the public to forward vaccine posts. Special attention should be paid to the negative sentimental tendency contained in this post on Weibo to mitigate the negative impact of the information epidemic and improve the transmission effect of COVID-19 vaccine information.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","COVID-19 vaccine; emotion; forwarding behavior; social media; social network structure","en",NA,NA,NA,291

The results show that inter-city air pollution in northeast China forms a complex and stable correlation network with obvious seasonal differences of ``high in winter and low in summer''. Different cities in the region play the roles of ``spillover'', ``intermediary'' and ``receiver'' of air pollution in the network. Small respirable particulate (PM2.5) pollution constitutes a significant component of air pollution in northeast China, which spreads from Liaoning province to Heilongjiang province via Jilin province.

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations.

The social network was used to represent the users' interaction and emotional flows to discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion patterns between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results revealed that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core users in the negative emotional contagion network. In the diabetes community, emotional contagion was less prevalent and core users in positive and negative emotional contagion networks were basically the same.

This classification naturally distinguishes pro- and anti-vaccine activists from moderates that promote or inhibit vaccination in discussions, which also play a key role that should be addressed by public policies. We find that all categories display relatively constant opinions, but that the number of tweeting accounts grows in each category during controversial periods. We also find that accounts disfavoring vaccination tend to appear in the periphery of the interaction network, which is consistent with Chile's high immunization levels. However, these are more active in addressing those favoring vaccination than vice-versa, revealing a potential communication problem even in a society where the antivaccine movement has no central role.

Dairy cattle may be moved between farms over long distances, and hence understanding the route and frequency of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread of BTB between farms, which could ultimately help to inform policy makers to design cost effective control strategies. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas among the Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa, Gondar and Mekelle. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern of dairy cattle movement for the last 5 years (September 2013 to August 2018). Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the relationship between the network patterns and the prevalence of BTB in these regions were made using social network analysis. RESULTS: The cattle movement network structure display both scale free and small world properties implying local clustering with fewer farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection, with the potential to act as super spreaders of BTB if infected. Farms having a history of cattle movements onto the herds were more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) compared to farms not having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and the batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with prevalence of BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more outgoing cattle showed a decrease on the likelihood of BTB infection (OR = 0.57) compared to farms which maintained their cattle. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the patterns of cattle movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to the potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk of transmission potential could be efficiently targeted by control measures aimed at reducing the spread of BTB. The network structure described can also provide the starting point to build and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other infectious diseases.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Bovine tuberculosis transmission; Contact network analysis; Ethiopia; Scale free; Small world","en",NA,NA,NA,298

When such disasters occur, the central government of South Korea and its affiliated local governments-together with nongovernmental organizations-play a crucial role in crisis management systems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to corroborate the characteristics government ministries and domestic and foreign institutions exhibit through their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the social network analysis technique, the span of the COVID-19 pandemic was segmented into 3 time frames, and the relational characteristics of the COVID-19 contagious disease response department and related agencies at home and abroad were analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the second and third time frames indicates that the agents reacting to contagious diseases do not necessarily hold the central position in the network. From this, it can be inferred that it is not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the key to a successful response to various disasters also lies in cooperation with the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruency between the findings of this paper and the existing disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that both the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate for a coordinated crisis response in disaster situations. Furthermore, much significance lies in the fact that this paper explores the various aspects that could surface among the host and relevant parties in a real-life pandemic.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","COVID-19; contagious disease response; government departments' networks; network structure; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,301

METHODS: Data were collected through baseline and 6-month assessments for the Social Networks among Appalachian People study (2008-2011). Interviewer-administered surveys collected sociodemographic and drug use behaviors (past 6 months and lifetime). Participants also listed sex, drug use, and social support partners (past 6 months). Listed names were cross-referenced with survey participants to identify relationships between study participants. The analytic sample was further restricted to include only those relationship pairs where both individuals reported a history of injection drug use at baseline (n = 244 unique individuals and 746 dyads). We fit a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model to (1) assess the relationship between peer injection cessation and individual injection cessation and (2) determine whether the strength of this association differs by relationship-level variables (i.e., relationship role, relationship type, relationship duration, frequency of interaction, residential proximity). RESULTS: Overall, those with a network member who ceased injection drug use were more likely to stop injecting over the following 6-month period (AOR=1.65). The magnitude of this association was greater for social support partners (AOR=2.95), family members (AOR=3.56), those with whom the participant interacted at least daily (AOR=2.17), and those who the participant knew longer (AOR=2.09). Further, among family members, the effect size was greater when relationships were further restricted to immediate family members (AOR=5.35). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in this rural community, closer, more supportive relationships, may be more influential for modeling injection cessation; however, relationship-types were not mutually exclusive so differences in effect size across strata may not be statistically significant.

Specifically, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species, and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques. Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social structure. The global features of these networks that influence disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological covariates, need further investigation.

OBJECTIVES: Basic Psychological Needs Theory will be utilized to understand how sexual health communication (SHC) influences sexual health behaviors of HBC-MSM. The proposed study will advance this goal by describing characteristics of SHC embedded within social and sexual networks, and identifying the effects of SHC on sexual health behaviors among a sample of Black and Latino HBC-MSM. METHODS: This study entails cross-sectional quantitative survey design with internet-based data collection to test a theory-driven model of the effects of autonomy supportive communication on sexual health behaviors. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and internet driven sampling (ID) will be used to recruit a sample of 200 HBC-MSM. We will utilize egocentric network analysis to describe (a) the HBC-specific social and/or sexual network members who provide SHC; (b) the degree of autonomy support provided by network members, and (c) the sexual health behaviors characterizing the sample of HBC-MSM. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be performed to test associations between autonomy supportive sexual health communication (independent variable) and sexual health behaviors (outcome), with needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation as intervening mediators. DISCUSSION: Such knowledge is necessary to expand understanding of how SHC impacts sexual health behaviors for HBC-MSM. The study provides an critical perspective on sexual health behaviors and motivations as participants operate in HBC. Knowledge generated from this study will help improve current HIV prevention interventions, as well as inform the development of future interventions, tailored to HBC-MSM.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,317

The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled with communities and practices where the interactions between birds are high, emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken diseases in the province. However, to set up such a system requires knowledge of the value chain and trade networks. Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted. Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be targeted for disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size and influence within their ego networks. Traders and their transport vehicles were identified as biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified three municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) and Enoch Mgijima as trade hubs where interaction between rural chickens occurs and resources can be focused. The movement of spent hens from commercial operations that are transported over long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the first study to formally describe chicken trade networks within the province and the surrounding region. Its findings provide a model for cost effective targeted surveillance in the ECP and similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also provides insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a possible contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation once the barriers to market entry are lifted.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Disease surveillance; hotspots; rural chicken; trade networks; value chain","en",NA,NA,NA,318

We sought to understand the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on ethnocultural communities to inform intersectoral advocacy and community action. METHODS: The Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with social network analysis. RESULTS: Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal health and social system supports. INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation.

This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6\%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown.

The current study aimed to explore the coevolution of sociometric popularity and depressive symptoms among adolescents suffering from the stress attached to the Chinese gaokao. METHODS: The analytical sample comprised 1062 Chinese adolescents who were under significant pressure to return to school for an additional year (returnees) to prepare for college entrance examinations. Students were assessed for depressive symptoms and asked to nominate up to five friends within their classes across four waves (six months). We employed stochastic actor-oriented models to investigate the interdependent relationships between popularity and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Adolescents' depressive symptoms negatively predicted future friendship popularity in this stressful situation, but not vice versa. The results of this study also highlighted the importance of friends' popularity, indicating that adolescents who nominated popular peers as friends tended to subsequently have lower depressive symptoms.

The findings are as follows: First, the inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19 patent cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation level, kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based cooperation has the widest scope, while proximity-based cooperation exists throughout these two main models of cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core position in the network, and play an important role in utilizing structural holes and bridging.

The overall connectivity of the contact network is low, but there are still some clustered infections. In terms of the degree distribution, most cases' degrees are concentrated between 0 and 2, which is relatively low, and only a few ones have a higher degree value. The degree distribution also conforms to the power law distribution, indicating the network is a scale-free network. There are 17 cases with a degree greater than 10, and these cluster infections are usually caused by local transmission.

We conducted a review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand how workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS. DESIGN: Retrospective outbreak review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020. METHODS: The Victorian Department of Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission via households.

Some studies argue that high-density urban centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19. While several studies have examined the role of urban density and connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing different measures of urban density and connectivity during the first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database. We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county level, collected individually from regional government websites in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea.

We aimed to typologize the network-level norms of sexual behaviors within the social networks of Black sexual and gender minoritized groups (SGM) assigned male at birth. Survey data were collected in Chicago, Illinois, USA, between 2018 and 2019 from Black SGM.

People who use drugs alone may be at higher risk of experiencing harms, for example, due to lack of others who may call for emergency assistance. Alternatively, cryptomarkets may be a source of harm reduction information and drugs with better-known content and dose, potentially reducing the risk of adverse events. This study examines relationships between cryptomarket use, drug-using social networks and adverse drug events for MDMA, cocaine and LSD. METHOD: A subsample of 23,053 respondents from over 70 countries was collected in the 2018 Global Drug Survey. People who reported using MDMA, cocaine or LSD were asked about using cryptomarkets to purchase these drugs; any adverse drug events requiring medical treatment (combining seeking treatment and should have sought treatment but did not); and social networks who they had used the specific drug with. All measures referred to the last 12 months, hereon referred to as 'recent'. Binary logistic regressions examined relationships between cryptomarket use, drug-using social networks, and adverse drug events, controlling for age, gender, and frequency of drug use. RESULTS: Adverse events from any drug type were low (5.2\%) and for each drug; MDMA (3.5\%); cocaine (3.3\%); and LSD (3.5\%). After controlling for covariates, recent cryptomarket use was associated with increased likelihood of having no drug-using network for each drug type. People who recently used cryptomarkets were more likely to report adverse cocaine (AOR = 1.70 (1.22-2.37)) and LSD (AOR = 1.58 (1.12-2.09)) events. For those reporting a network size >1, network characteristics did not differ with recent cryptomarket use; however, those reporting recent cryptomarket use were more likely to report adverse LSD events (AOR = 1.86 (0.99-3.51)). CONCLUSION: People who reported purchasing drugs from cryptomarkets more commonly reported having no drug-using network, and cryptomarket purchase was associated with reported adverse events. Our results support the notion that cryptomarket use increases drug-related harm, but further disentanglement of multiple complex mechanisms is needed in future research.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Adverse drug events; Cryptomarkets; Social network analysis; Social networks","en",NA,NA,NA,345

First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,347

This systematic mapping review sought to assess critical research gaps in the field of global surgery guided by the World Health Organisation Health Systems building block framework, analysis of authorship and funding patterns, and an exploration of emerging research partnership networks. Literature was systematically mapped to identify, screen, and synthesize results of publications in the global surgery field between 2015 and March 2022. We searched four databases and included literature published in seven languages. A social network analysis determined the network attributes of research institutions and their transient relationships in shaping the global surgery research agenda. We identified 2,298 relevant studies out of 92,720 unique articles searched. Research output increased from 453 in 2015-16 to 552 in 2021-22, largely due to literature on Covid-19 impacts on surgery. Sub-Saharan Africa (792/2298) and South Asia (331/2298) were the most studied regions, although high-income countries represented a disproportionate number of first (42\%) and last (43\%) authors. Service delivery received the most attention, including the surgical burden and quality and safety of services, followed by capacity-building efforts in low- and middle-income countries. Critical research in economics and financing, essential infrastructure and supplies, and surgical leadership necessary to guide policy decisions at the country level were lacking. Global surgical systems remain largely under-researched. Knowledge diffusion requires an emphasis on developing sustainable research partnerships and capacity across low- and middle-income countries. A renewed focus must be given to equipping countries with tools for effective decision-making to enhance investments in high-quality surgical services.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Equity; Global surgery; Lancet commission on global surgery; Low and middle-income countries; Network analysis; Partnership; Research funding; World health organization health systems building blocks","en",NA,NA,NA,350

From 376 farms, data of 1300 ponds were collected from network data using a questionnaire. We found that 1477 nodes with 1315 ties appeared in this study. These were divided into a network of cases and controls that presented 538 nodes with 436 ties and 1013 nodes with 879 ties, respectively. The top four out-degree centrality values in the entire partial network, cases, and controls were used to analyze ego-alter similarity. The results showed that each PL provider played a different role in the association with the disease sender. A simulated network using exponential random graph models presented edges as a significant microstructure. In addition, our analysis indicated that the hatchery or nursery (PL provider) is an important node for AHPND occurrence.

To achieve the goal of the study, we apply methods of network and sentiment analysis to map users' interactions in the network communities and quantify users' sentiment polarities. The results of the analysis give little evidence for users' polarisation in the network and its communities, as well as suggest that the crisis had a limited effect on the polarisation dynamics on this social media platform.

However, there is a dearth of literature focused on the intersection of age and HIV status, particularly for older Black sexual minority men (SMM) who are disproportionately impacted by HIV. This study aimed to examine the intersecting effect of age and HIV status on Black SMM social networks in a sample from the Social Network and Prevention Study. Participants were 18 years of age or older, identified as cis-gender Black or African American, self-identified as SMM, reported unprotected sex within the past six months, and resided in Baltimore city or a surrounding county. The sample was divided into four categories by age (e.g., young, mature) and HIV status (e.g., positive, negative). Of the sample, 167 men were (a) Young \& HIV negative, 116 men were (b) Young \& HIV positive, 44 men were (c) Mature \& HIV negative, and 42 men were (d) Mature \& HIV positive. Among the four groups, mature men who were HIV positive had the fewest average number of alters who knew they were SMM. There was also overlap in the range of age of sexual partners across the four groups, ranging from 17 to 53.5 (Group 1), 20-60 (Group 2), 29.5-60 (Group 3), and 23-63 (Group 4) years of age.

Recently, a growing number of layer farms have been heavily damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased virulence of the virus and the intensification of the production system. Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive practices at the farm level that are aligned with contingency measures at the national level to minimize poultry losses. However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm workers to follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and control. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices varies with the geographical condition and inter-farm contact structures. Hence, the objective of our study was to examine the preventive effect of five biosecurity actions commonly practiced at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: (i) fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a farm; iii) disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection protocols, iv) an anterior room in the sheds before entering the bird area and v) boots changes when moving between sheds in the same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer case farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI epidemic. The odds ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices implemented in those study groups were estimated as a preventive effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, including seven geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location weighted logistic regression. The results showed that the use of a disinfection booth for personnel reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 \% credible interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263). Changing boots between sheds on the same farm reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (AOR = 0.160, 95 \% CrI = 0.024-0.852) with relatively wide spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR = 0.270-0.688). Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols at the farm of entry for layer farms is recommended to effectively prevent and respond to HPAIv H5N6 infection under different local condition. Our study provides an important message for layer farmers to effectively implement on-farm biosecurity actions against HPAIv H5N6 infection at their farms by setting priorities based on their spatial condition and network position.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Biosecurity; Chicken; Highly pathogenic avian influenza; Prevention; Social network analysis; Spatial analyses","en",NA,NA,NA,358

METHODS: The PROGRESO EN SALUD study compared the outcomes of two interventions adapted to include a social network component (VOICES and HEALTHY). Recruitment used a social network respondent-driven sampling design in which each seed was asked to recruit three friends, and those friends were asked to recruit three friends, for a total of twenty groups of 13 friends. We collected data at baseline, and 6 months and 12 months post intervention completion. We used generalized estimating equation models, properly adjusted for non-independent contributions of both social network interventions, to estimate the effects. Gaussian family multivariate models were calculated, addressing exchangeable working correlations, including both individual-level and cluster-level covariates in these models. RESULTS: A total of 261 Latina seasonal workers participated in either the HEALTHY or the VOICES intervention. There were significant changes over time in cognitive factors (HIV knowledge, condom use self-efficacy, and adequate knowledge of condom use), behavioral factors (condom use, female condom use, and HIV testing), and communication factors (talking with friends about HIV prevention and intention to negotiate safe sex with male partners).

Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a $\leq$3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility ($\kappa$ score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0).
