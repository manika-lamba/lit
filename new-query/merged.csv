WE EXAMINED DIFFERENT NETWORK PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE SUCCESSFUL DISSEMINATION BY AND ADOPTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND HEALTH AGENCIES. METHODS: WE FOCUSED ON CONVERSATIONS ON TWITTER DURING 3 KEY COMMUNICATION EVENTS FROM LATE JANUARY TO EARLY JUNE OF 2020. WE USED NETLYTIC, A WEB-BASED SOFTWARE THAT COLLECTS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SITES SUCH AS TWITTER. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE NETWORK OF CONVERSATIONS AROUND COVID-19 IS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED, FRAGMENTED, AND LOOSELY CONNECTED; THESE CHARACTERISTICS CAN HINDER THE SUCCESSFUL DISSEMINATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES IN A NETWORK. COMPETING CONVERSATIONS AND MISINFORMATION CAN HAMPER RISK COMMUNICATION EFFORTS IN A WAY THAT IMPERIL PUBLIC HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: LOOKING AT BASIC METRICS MIGHT CREATE A MISLEADING PICTURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK COMMUNICATION EFFORTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IF NOT ANALYZED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE LARGER NETWORK.

SOCIAL MEDIA USE INCREASED WORLDWIDE, AS WELL AS IN TURKEY, DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES/FAKE NEWS ABOUT MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF VACCINES SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS RELATED TO VACCINES AND TO IDENTIFY KEY INFLUENCES/INFLUENCERS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC USING SOCIAL NETWORK DATA FROM TWITTER. MATERIALS AND METHODS TWO DATASETS, INCLUDING TWEETS ABOUT VACCINATIONS BEFORE AND AFTER COVID-19 IN TURKEY, WERE COLLECTED. SOCIAL NETWORKS WERE CREATED BASED ON INTERACTIONS (MENTIONS) BETWEEN TWITTER USERS. USERS AND THEIR INFLUENCE WERE SCORED BASED ON SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND PARAMETERS THAT INCLUDED IN-DEGREE AND BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY. RESULTS IN THE PRE-COVID-19 NETWORK, MEDIA FIGURES AND AUTHORS WHO HAD ANTI-VACCINE VIEWS WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL USERS. IN THE POST-COVID-19 NETWORK, THE TURKISH MINISTER OF HEALTH, THE WAS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURE. THE VACCINE NETWORK WAS OBSERVED TO BE GROWING RAPIDLY AFTER COVID-19, AND THE PHYSICIANS AND AUTHORS WHO HAD OPINIONS ABOUT MANDATORY VACCINATIONS RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF REACTION.

INVESTIGATION USING TRADITIONAL MICROBIOLOGICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TOOLS CAN LEAD TO IMPRECISE SCREENING STRATEGIES DUE TO DIFFICULTIES CHARACTERISING COMPLEX TRANSMISSION NETWORKS. APPLICATION OF WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS) AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY FACILITATE RAPID DIRECTED PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION. WE REPORT THE UTILITY OF THESE METHODS IN COMBINATION WITH TRADITIONAL APPROACHES FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INVESTIGATE A TB OUTBREAK IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING. METHODS: LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION (LTBI) CASES WERE SCREENEES WITH A POSITIVE T-SPOT (R).TB TEST. ACTIVE TB CASES WERE DEFINED THROUGH LABORATORY CONFIRMATION OF M. TUBERCULOSIS ON CULTURE OR THROUGH CLINICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH INFECTION. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM INSTITUTIONAL RECORDS AND SCREENEES. SAMPLES WERE CULTURED AND ANALYSED USING TRADITIONAL M. TUBERCULOSIS TYPING AND WGS. WE UNDERTOOK MULTIVARIABLE MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH CASE STATUS AND RISK COMMUNITIES. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 189 LTBI CASES (13.7\% POSITIVITY RATE) AND NINE ACTIVE TB CASES FROM 1377 PERSONS SCREENED. THE LTBI POSITIVITY RATE WAS 39.1\% (99/253) AMONG PERSONS WHO SHARED A COURSE WITH AN INFECTIOUS CASE (ODDS RATIO 7.3, 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 5.2 TO 10.3). THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS DIVIDED THE STUDENTS INTO FIVE COMMUNITIES BASED ON CONNECTIVITY, AS OPPOSED TO THE 11 SHARED COURSES. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE SUSPECTED INDEX CASE WAS AT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED RISK OF ACTIVE DISEASE (ODDS RATIO 7.5, 95\% CI 1.3 TO 44.0) AND CONTAINED EIGHT PERSONS WHO WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP. FIVE SPUTUM SAMPLES UNDERWENT WGS, FOUR HAD ZERO SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM (SNP) DIFFERENCES AND ONE HAD A SINGLE SNP DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT AN UNDIAGNOSED CASE OF ACTIVE TB DISEASE CAN HAVE IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING WITHIN A LOW INCIDENCE AREA.

FOR PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS, HOW TO DIFFUSE THE MESSAGE BROADLY AND EFFICIENTLY IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK IS A CLASSICAL PROBLEM, WHICH IS NAMED INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION (IM). IM CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM OF FINDING A SMALL SET OF NETWORK USERS AS SEED NODES THAT MAXIMIZES THE SPREAD OF INFLUENCE FOR A PIECE OF INFORMATION UNDER A CERTAIN INFLUENCE CASCADE MODEL. WITH A LOT OF RESEARCHES FOCUSING ON THIS FIELD, MOST EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE PROPOSED TO EXTRACT SEED NODES ONLY CONSIDERING PURE TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURES. IN PRACTICE, NODES IN HEALTH-RELATED NETWORKS ARE OFTEN ABUNDANTLY ACCOMPANIED WITH OTHER TYPES OF MEANINGFUL INFORMATION SUCH AS NODE ATTRIBUTES (IDENTITY), SECOND-ORDER PROXIMITY, AND EDGE ATTRIBUTES (USER RELATIONSHIP), WHILE CONVENTIONAL IM MODELS OVERLOOK THESE INFORMATION. THEREFORE, A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR INCORPORATING THE HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION INTO AN IM MODEL COULD BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL TO FIND UNDERLYING SEED NODES IN HEALTH-RELATED NETWORKS. MOREOVER, THE STABILITY AND THE COMPUTATIONAL COST ARE ALSO THE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT CURRENT IM MODELS FACE. TO BRIDGE THESE GAPS, IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE NE-IM (NETWORK EMBEDDING FOR INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION), A METHOD THAT ASPIRES TO ADDRESS BOTH PROBLEMS USING REPRESENTATION LEARNING.

MOST OF THE PROPOSALS HAVE FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH STATIC DATASETS GATHERED FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS, WHICH ARE PROCESSED AND MINED OFF-LINE. HOWEVER, LITTLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON PROVIDING A GENERAL FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE THE HIGHLY DYNAMIC DATA OF SOCIAL NETWORKS FROM A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

A POPULAR THEORY POSITS THAT THE PANDEMIC IS A HOAX AND SUGGESTS THAT CERTAIN HOSPITALS ARE ``EMPTY.'' RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ACCEPTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MAY IGNORE GOVERNMENT ADVICE ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SECOND WAVE AND FUTURE PANDEMICS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF MISINFORMATION AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE IT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY SET OUT TO EVALUATE THE \#FILMYOURHOSPITAL CONSPIRACY THEORY ON TWITTER, ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS BEHIND IT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO DETERMINE WHICH ONLINE SOURCES OF INFORMATION WERE USED AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE THEORY, THE RATIO OF AUTOMATED TO ORGANIC ACCOUNTS IN THE NETWORK, AND WHAT LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF SUCH A CONSPIRACY THEORY IN THE FUTURE. METHODS: TWITTER DATA RELATED TO THE \#FILMYOURHOSPITAL HASHTAG WERE RETRIEVED AND ANALYZED USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS ACROSS A 7-DAY PERIOD FROM APRIL 13-20, 2020. THE DATA SET CONSISTED OF 22,785 TWEETS AND 11,333 TWITTER USERS. THE BOTOMETER TOOL WAS USED TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WITH A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF BEING BOTS. RESULTS: THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORY ARE ORDINARY CITIZENS; ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ACCOUNTS IS A BREXIT SUPPORTER. WE FOUND THAT YOUTUBE WAS THE INFORMATION SOURCE MOST LINKED TO BY USERS. THE MOST RETWEETED POST BELONGED TO A VERIFIED TWITTER USER, INDICATING THAT THE USER MAY HAVE HAD MORE INFLUENCE ON THE PLATFORM. THERE WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS (BOTS) AND DELETED ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE NETWORK. CONCLUSIONS: HASHTAGS USING AND SHARING CONSPIRACY THEORIES CAN BE TARGETED IN AN EFFORT TO DELEGITIMIZE CONTENT CONTAINING MISINFORMATION.

IN THIS STUDY, THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN ORANGE COUNTY (DOH-ORANGE) DEVELOPED A BASELINE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF PATIENT MOVEMENT ACROSS HEALTH CARE ENTITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA, AND REGIONALLY, WITHIN 6 SURROUNDING COUNTIES IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. MATERIALS AND METHODS DOH-ORANGE CONSTRUCTED 2 DIRECTED NETWORK SOCIOGRAMS-GRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS THAT SHOW THE DIRECTION OF RELATIONSHIPS (IE, COUNTY AND REGIONAL)-BY USING 2016 HEALTH INSURANCE DATA FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE \& MEDICAID SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE METRICS THAT COULD BE USEFUL FOR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS MDRO OUTBREAKS. RESULTS WE FOUND THAT BOTH OUR COUNTY AND REGIONAL NETWORKS WERE SPARSE AND CENTRALIZED. THE COUNTY-LEVEL NETWORK SHOWED THAT ACUTE-CARE HOSPITALS HAD THE HIGHEST INFLUENCE ON CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF PATIENTS BETWEEN HEALTH CARE ENTITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE CONNECTED.

WE COLLECTED DATA ABOUT THEIR INFORMATION SEEKING PRACTICES REGARDING FOUR TYPES OF INFORMATION: HIKING AND PARKS, MENTAL HEALTH, FUNDING SOURCES, AND THE MOOD WALKS PROGRAMME. FINDINGS: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TURNED TO PARK AND RECREATION SECTOR PARTNERS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HIKING AND LOCAL HIKING AMENITIES BUT DID NOT SEEK INFORMATION FROM THEM ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, FUNDING SOURCES, OR THE PROGRAMME ITSELF. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: PARK AND RECREATION SECTOR PARTNERS ARE VIEWED BY OTHER SECTORAL PARTNERS AS SOURCES OF CRITICAL INFORMATION IN THE DELIVERY OF THIS PARK-BASED HEALTH INITIATIVE. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES THE UTILITY OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IN UNDERSTANDING MULTI-SECTORAL PARK-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMMES AND CONFIRMS THE RELEVANCE OF THE PARK AND RECREATION SECTOR TO PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN NATURE SETTINGS.","10.1080/23750472.2021.1932563","2375-0472","MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE","473-489","ASSESSING THE RELEVANCE OF PARKS IN A MULTISECTORAL PARKHEALTH PROGRAMME","28",2023,"ISI","Manag.

COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF OTHER VACCINES DUE TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEING USED, RAPID DEVELOPMENT, AND WIDESPREAD GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION. ATTITUDES ON VACCINES ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY ONLINE INFORMATION, PARTICULARLY INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE FIRST STEP TOWARD INFLUENCING ATTITUDES ABOUT IMMUNIZATION IS UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT PATTERNS OF COMMUNICATION THAT CHARACTERIZE THE IMMUNIZATION DEBATE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO EVALUATE SOCIETAL ATTITUDES, COMMUNICATION TRENDS, AND BARRIERS TO COVID-19 VACCINE UPTAKE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ANALYSIS TO INFORM COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES PROMOTING VACCINE ACCEPTANCE.METHODS: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE COVID-19 VACCINE CONTENT ON TWITTER GLOBALLY. TWEETS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH WERE COLLECTED THROUGH THE TWITTER APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE BETWEEN NOVEMBER 19 AND 26, 2020, JUST FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF INITIAL COVID-19 VACCINE TRIALS. SNA WAS USED TO IDENTIFY SOCIAL MEDIA CLUSTERS EXPRESSING MISTRUSTFUL OPINIONS ON COVID-19 VACCINATION. BASED ON THE SNA RESULTS, AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING USING A SENTENCE-LEVEL ALGORITHM TRANSFER FUNCTION TO DETECT SEMANTIC TEXTUAL SIMILARITY WAS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN THEMES OF VACCINE HESITANCY.RESULTS: THE TWEETS (N=636,516) IDENTIFIED THAT THE MAIN THEMES DRIVING THE VACCINE HESITANCY CONVERSATION WERE CONCERNS OF SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND FREEDOM, AND MISTRUST IN INSTITUTIONS (EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS). A MAIN THEME WAS THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MRNA TECHNOLOGY AND SIDE EFFECTS. THE CONVERSATION AROUND EFFICACY WAS THAT VACCINES WERE UNLIKELY TO COMPLETELY RID THE POPULATION OF COVID-19, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION TESTING IS FLAWED, AND THERE IS NO INDICATION OF LONG-TERM T-CELL IMMUNITY FOR COVID-19. NEARLY ONE-THIRD (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) OF THE CONVERSATIONS ON COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY CLUSTERS EXPRESSED CONCERNS FOR FREEDOM OR MISTRUST OF INSTITUTIONS (EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS) AND NEARLY A QUARTER (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) EXPRESSED CRITICISM TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC.CONCLUSIONS: SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE THEMES OF THE VACCINATION CONVERSATION ON TWITTER.

ALGORITHMIC RECOMMENDATION-BASED TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH USERS' SELECTIVE EXPOSURE AND GROUP PRESSURE LEAD TO ONLINE ECHO CHAMBERS, CAUSING INEFFICIENCY IN VACCINATION PROMOTION. AVOIDING OR BREAKING ECHO CHAMBERS LARGELY RELIES ON KEY USERS' BEHAVIOR. OBJECTIVE: WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF ECHO CHAMBERS RELATED TO VACCINE HESITANCY ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK TO QUANTIFY THE ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT IN USERS' TOPIC SELECTION AND ATTITUDE CONTAGION ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINES OR VACCINATIONS; DETECT ONLINE OPINION LEADERS AND STRUCTURAL HOLE SPANNERS BASED ON NETWORK ATTRIBUTES; AND EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS AND NETWORK LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIPS OF NETWORK LOCATIONS AND IMPACT ON TOPIC-BASED AND ATTITUDE-BASED ECHO CHAMBERS. METHODS: WE CALLED THE SINA WEIBO APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE TO CRAWL TWEETS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 VACCINE OR VACCINATION AND USER INFORMATION ON WEIBO, A CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. ADOPTING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE EXAMINED THE LOW ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT BASED ON TOPICS IN REPRESENTATIONAL NETWORKS OF INFORMATION, ACCORDING TO ATTITUDE IN COMMUNICATION FLOW NETWORKS OF USERS UNDER DIFFERENT INTERACTIVE MECHANISMS (RETWEETING, COMMENTING). STATISTICAL AND VISUAL ANALYSES WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF KEY USERS (OPINION LEADERS, STRUCTURAL HOLE SPANNERS), AND TO EXPLORE THEIR FUNCTION IN AVOIDING OR BREAKING TOPIC-BASED AND ATTITUDE-BASED ECHO CHAMBERS. RESULTS: USERS SHOWED A LOW ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT IN VACCINE-RELATED TOPIC SELECTION AND ATTITUDE INTERACTION. FOR THE FORMER, THE HOMOPHILY WAS MORE OBVIOUS IN RETWEETING THAN IN COMMENTING, WHEREAS THE OPPOSITE TREND WAS FOUND FOR THE LATTER.

Internet Res.-a","AHMED W;VIDAL-ALABALL J;DOWNING J;LOPEZ ;SEGUI F","BACKGROUND: SINCE THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER 2019, THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH HAS LED TO INCREASED DISCUSSIONS ACROSS ONLINE PLATFORMS. THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE ALSO INCLUDED VARIOUS CONSPIRACIES SHARED BY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. AMONGST THEM, A POPULAR THEORY HAS LINKED 5G TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, LEADING TO MISINFORMATION AND THE BURNING OF 5G TOWERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF FAKE NEWS AND QUICK POLICIES ORIENTED TO ISOLATE AND REBATE MISINFORMATION ARE KEYS TO COMBATING IT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS OF THE 5G COVID-19 CONSPIRACY THEORY AND STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH SUCH MISINFORMATION. METHODS: THIS PAPER PERFORMS A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA FROM A 7-DAY PERIOD (FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 2020, TO SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 2020) IN WHICH THE \#5GCORONAVIRUS HASHTAG WAS TRENDING ON TWITTER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INFLUENTIAL USERS WERE ANALYZED THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORK GRAPH CLUSTERS. THE SIZE OF THE NODES WERE RANKED BY THEIR BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY SCORE, AND THE GRAPH'S VERTICES WERE GROUPED BY CLUSTER USING THE CLAUSET-NEWMAN-MOORE ALGORITHM. THE TOPICS AND WEB SOURCES USED WERE ALSO EXAMINED. RESULTS: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT THE TWO LARGEST NETWORK STRUCTURES CONSISTED OF AN ISOLATES GROUP AND A BROADCAST GROUP. THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF AN AUTHORITY FIGURE WHO WAS ACTIVELY COMBATING SUCH MISINFORMATION. CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT, OF 233 SAMPLE TWEETS, 34.8\% (N=81) CONTAINED VIEWS THAT 5G AND COVID-19 WERE LINKED, 32.2\% (N=75) DENOUNCED THE CONSPIRACY THEORY, AND 33.0\% (N=77) WERE GENERAL TWEETS NOT EXPRESSING ANY PERSONAL VIEWS OR OPINIONS. THUS, 65.2\% (N=152) OF TWEETS DERIVED FROM NONCONSPIRACY THEORY SUPPORTERS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE TOPIC ATTRACTED HIGH VOLUME, ONLY A HANDFUL OF USERS GENUINELY BELIEVED THE CONSPIRACY. THIS PAPER ALSO SHOWS THAT FAKE NEWS WEBSITES WERE THE MOST POPULAR WEB SOURCE SHARED BY USERS; ALTHOUGH, YOUTUBE VIDEOS WERE ALSO SHARED. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED AN ACCOUNT WHOSE SOLE AIM WAS TO SPREAD THE CONSPIRACY THEORY ON TWITTER. CONCLUSIONS: THE COMBINATION OF QUICK AND TARGETED INTERVENTIONS ORIENTED TO DELEGITIMIZE THE SOURCES OF FAKE INFORMATION IS KEY TO REDUCING THEIR IMPACT. THOSE USERS VOICING THEIR VIEWS AGAINST THE CONSPIRACY THEORY, LINK BAITING, OR SHARING HUMOROUS TWEETS INADVERTENTLY RAISED THE PROFILE OF THE TOPIC, SUGGESTING THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD INSIST IN THE EFFORTS OF ISOLATING OPINIONS THAT ARE BASED ON FAKE NEWS. MANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PROVIDE USERS WITH THE ABILITY TO REPORT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT, WHICH SHOULD BE USED. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO ANALYZE THE 5G CONSPIRACY THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 ON TWITTER OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDANCE TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN HOW, IN THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC, RUMORS MAY BE COMBATED IN THE FUTURE.","10.2196/19458","1438-8871","JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH",NA,"COVID19 AND THE 5G CONSPIRACY THEORY SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA","22",2020,"ISI","J.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY AND LIFE-CYCLE CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE REPRESENTS THE PROCESS OF TIME DYNAMICS. AT PRESENT, IT IS AN INEVITABLE TREND TO ESTABLISH A COLLABORATIVE MECHANISM FOR EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES TO IMPROVE THE RELEASE EFFICIENCY AND RESPOND TO PUBLIC DEMAND. TO DETERMINE TIME EVOLUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION IN EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE, THIS STUDY TOOK THE RESPONSE TO COVID-19 FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE AND CONDUCTED RESEARCH BASED ON SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. BASED ON INFORMATION FROM COVID-19-RELATED PRESS CONFERENCES HELD BY CHINA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, THE EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS (EIRCNS), AND EMERGENCY ORGANIZATIONS-EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE MATTERS (EOS-EIRMS) 2-MODE NETWORK WERE CONSTRUCTED. WITH THE TIME EVOLUTION, THE TIGHTNESS, CONVERGENCE, STABILITY, AND CONNECTIVITY OF EIRCNS IN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES PRESENTED THE PROCESS OF LOWERING AND THEN RAISING. AT DIFFERENT STAGES, THE CORE EMERGENCY ORGANIZATION (EO) NODES IN EIRCNS CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN DEGREE OF ACTIVITY. THEIR DYNAMIC PROCESSES SHOWED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DIVERSIFICATION RATHER THAN HOMOGENEITY. THE TIME EVOLUTION OF EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE MATTERS (EIRMS) REFLECTED THE DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PREVENTION AND CONTROL MEASURES AND RESPONDED TO THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING AND PROTECTION NEEDS DURING DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE STUDY FURTHER EXAMINED THE DRIVING FACTORS AND IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM OF THE TIME EVOLUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COLLABORATIVE MODE OF EMERGENCY INFORMATION RELEASE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EIRMS AT DIFFERENT STAGES HAD DIFFERENT RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WERE USUALLY ACHIEVED BY INTRODUCING NEW EOS (ADDING RESOURCE INCREMENT) OR INCREASING THE COLLABORATIVE FREQUENCIES AMONG EOS (ACTIVATING RESOURCE STOCK).

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD HOW WTD ARE SPREADING THESE DISEASES. IN THIS PAPER, WE SPECULATE THAT ``SUPER-SPREADERS'' MEDIATE DISEASE TRANSMISSION VIA DIRECT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND INDIRECTLY VIA BODY FLUIDS EXCHANGED AT SCRAPE SITES. SUPER-SPREADERS ARE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS THAT INFECT MORE CONTACTS THAN OTHER INFECTIOUS INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A POPULATION. USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL SUPERSPREADERS AMONG MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES OF A RURAL WTD HERD IN MISSISSIPPI. ANALYSIS OF AGE STRUCTURE REVEALED THAT THE MAJORITY OF POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS WERE YOUNG MALES, LESS THAN 2.5 YEARS OF AGE. WE ALSO COMPARED INFECTION RISK ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE BY COMBINING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND HEATMAPPING SOFTWARE TO LOCATE DISEASE TRANSMISSION HOTSPOTS, WHERE THE RISK OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS HIGHER AS COMPARED TO OTHER LOCATIONS. WE ALSO MONITORED PREDATOR AND HUNTING ACTIVITY AND HUNTER DEER HARVESTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW PREDATORS INFLUENCE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND POTENTIAL DISEASE TRANSMISSION. WE FOUND THAT PREDATOR ACTIVITY INFLUENCED THE AGE STRUCTURE OF MALE WTD COMMUNITIES. WE ASSESSED DISEASE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BY SOCIAL-NETWORK MODELING USING HUNTER HARVESTS OR THE REMOVAL OF POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS, WHICH FRAGMENTED WTD SOCIAL NETWORKS REDUCING THE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF DISEASE.

SUPER-SPREADERS ARE INFECTED INDIVIDUALS THAT INFECT MORE CONTACTS THAN OTHER INFECTIOUS INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A POPULATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED NETWORK ANALYSIS FROM SCRAPE VISITATION DATA TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS AMONG MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES OF A RURAL WTD HERD. WE COMBINED LOCAL NETWORK COMMUNITIES TO FORM A LARGE REGION-WIDE SOCIAL NETWORK CONSISTING OF 96 MALE WTD. ANALYSIS OF WTD BACHELOR GROUPS AND RANDOM NETWORK MODELING DEMONSTRATED THAT SCRAPING NETWORKS DEPICT REAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, ALLOWING DETECTION OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONTACTS, WHICH COULD SPREAD DISEASES. USING THIS REGIONAL NETWORK, WE MODEL THREE MAJOR TYPES OF POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE: IN-DEGREE, OUT-DEGREE, AND BETWEENNESS POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS. WE FOUND OUT-DEGREE AND BETWEENNESS POTENTIAL SUPER-SPREADERS TO BE CRITICAL FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION ACROSS MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES.

THE PRODUCERS OF THE DOCUMENTARY SOUGHT TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND TO DISCREDIT SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS USING A SOPHISTICATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN. THEY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY COACHING CITIZENS TOWARD ACTIVISM TO MAXIMIZE THE SPEED AT WHICH THE DOCUMENTARY PROPAGATED AND DECREASE POSITIVE SENTIMENTS TOWARD PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. APPLYING TECHNIQUES FROM SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FORMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLANDEMIC DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AS A CASE STUDY OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BY COMPARING THE TWITTER NETWORK'S COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATION PATTERNS BEFORE AND AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FILM, WE DEMONSTRATE THE PLANDEMIC CAMPAIGN TO HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, THE CAMPAIGN ESTABLISHED A DECENTRALIZED INFORMATION SHARING NETWORK ON TWITTER BY COACHING LOW-REACH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS TO MASS SHARE THE DOCUMENTARY, EFFECTIVELY SUBVERTING EFFORTS TO GATEKEEP ITS MISINFORMATION. SECOND, THE CAMPAIGN AMPLIFIED NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS REGARDING VACCINATION AND CONTAINMENT MEASURES AMONG CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

METHODSWE CONDUCTED A PARTICIPANT-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED, ONLINE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-BASED HEALTH-EDUCATION INTERVENTION STUDY FROM MARCH 2019 TO FEBRUARY 2020 IN SHANGHAI. WE ESTABLISHED FOUR WECHAT GROUPS (TWO INTERVENTION GROUPS AND TWO CONTROL GROUPS). FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUPS, A DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT REGULARLY DELIVERED INFORMATION REGARDING UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES AMONG CHILDREN, AND COMMUNITY CHILDCARE DOCTORS ANSWERED PARENTS' QUESTIONS CONCERNING THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH, INCLUDING UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. MEANWHILE, THE CONTROL GROUPS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE ASSISTANT.

ALTHOUGH AGGREGATE METRICS ON THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION DIFFUSION ARE AVAILABLE, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW INFORMATION SPREADS ON ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS. HEALTH INFORMATION COULD BE TRANSMITTED FROM ONE TO MANY (I.E. BROADCASTING) OR FROM A CHAIN OF INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL (I.E. VIRAL SPREADING). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE SPREADING PATTERN OF EBOLA INFORMATION ON TWITTER AND IDENTIFY INFLUENTIAL USERS REGARDING EBOLA MESSAGES.METHODSOUR DATA WAS PURCHASED FROM GNIP. WE OBTAINED ALL EBOLA-RELATED TWEETS POSTED GLOBALLY FROM MARCH 23, 2014 TO MAY 31, 2015. WE RECONSTRUCTED EBOLA-RELATED RETWEETING PATHS BASED ON TWITTER CONTENT AND THE FOLLOWER-FOLLOWEE RELATIONSHIPS. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE RETWEETING PATTERNS. IN ADDITION TO DESCRIBING THE DIFFUSION STRUCTURES, WE CLASSIFY USERS IN THE NETWORK INTO FOUR CATEGORIES (I.E., INFLUENTIAL USER, HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USER, DISSEMINATOR, COMMON USER) BASED ON FOLLOWING AND RETWEETING PATTERNS.RESULTSON AVERAGE, 91\% OF THE RETWEETS WERE DIRECTLY RETWEETED FROM THE INITIAL MESSAGE. MOREOVER, 47.5\% OF THE RETWEETING PATHS OF THE ORIGINAL TWEETS HAD A DEPTH OF 1 (I.E., FROM THE SEED USER TO ITS IMMEDIATE FOLLOWERS). THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGESTED THAT THE BROADCASTING WAS MORE PERVASIVE THAN VIRAL SPREADING. WE FOUND THAT INFLUENTIAL USERS AND HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS TRIGGERED MORE RETWEETS THAN DISSEMINATORS AND COMMON USERS. DISSEMINATORS AND COMMON USERS RELIED MORE ON THE VIRAL MODEL FOR SPREADING INFORMATION BEYOND THEIR IMMEDIATE FOLLOWERS VIA INFLUENTIAL AND HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS.CONCLUSIONSBROADCASTING WAS THE DOMINANT MECHANISM OF INFORMATION DIFFUSION OF A MAJOR HEALTH EVENT ON TWITTER. IT SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATORS CAN WORK BENEFICIALLY WITH INFLUENTIAL AND HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS, BECAUSE INFLUENTIAL AND HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS CAN REACH MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE PUBLIC HEALTH TWITTER ACCOUNTS. ALTHOUGH BOTH INFLUENTIAL USERS AND HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS CAN TRIGGER MANY RETWEETS, RECOGNIZING AND USING THE HIDDEN INFLUENTIAL USERS AS THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION COULD POTENTIALLY BE A COST-EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROMOTION.

DATA SOURCES WE USED 2018 NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL SURVEY OF PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS DATA, A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE COHORT OF THE US PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS. STUDY DESIGN SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS MEASURES WERE COMPUTED TO INDICATE THE EXTENT OF TRIBAL ORGANIZATION PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC HEALTH NETWORKS AND TO UNDERSTAND THE SECTORS AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ENGAGE WITH TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. TWO-PART REGRESSION MODELS ESTIMATED PREDICTORS OF TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT. DATA COLLECTION A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES WAS SURVEYED, YIELDING 574 RESPONDENTS. AN ADDITIONAL COHORT OF OVERSAMPLED RESPONDENTS WAS ALSO SURVEYED TO INCLUDE JURISDICTIONS FROM THE ENTIRE STATE UPON THE REQUEST OF THEIR RESPECTIVE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (N = 154). ANALYSES WERE RESTRICTED TO JURISDICTIONS WITH A NEARBY AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) SERVING HEALTH FACILITY, YIELDING A FINAL SAMPLE SIZE OF 258 LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS WHEN AN AI/AN SERVING HEALTH FACILITY WAS PRESENT IN THE REGION, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATED IN 28\% OF PUBLIC HEALTH NETWORKS AND 9\% OF IMPLEMENTED PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. NETWORKS WITH TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT WERE MORE COMPREHENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE BREADTH OF SECTORS AND SOCIAL SERVICES PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK AND THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED RELATIVE TO NETWORKS WITHOUT TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT.

DECREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS ONE OF THE MAIN SOCIETAL CHANGES DRIVING THE CURRENT OBESITY PANDEMIC. OBJECTIVE: OUR GOALS ARE TO FILL A GAP IN THE LITERATURE AND STUDY WHETHER USERS ORGANICALLY UTILIZE A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TWITTER, FOR PROVIDING MOTIVATION. WE EXAMINE THE TOPICS OF MESSAGES AND SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURES ON TWITTER. WE DISCUSS SOCIAL MEDIA'S POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING PEER SUPPORT AND THEN DRAW INSIGHTS TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERVENTIONS FOR LONG-TERM HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR CHANGE. METHODS: WE EXAMINED MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES RELATED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON TWITTER. FIRST, WE COLLECTED TWEETS RELATED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SECOND, WE ANALYZED THEM USING (1) A LEXICON-BASED APPROACH TO EXTRACT AND CHARACTERIZE MOTIVATION-RELATED TWEETS, (2) A THEMATIC ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE COMMON THEMES IN RETWEETS, AND (3) TOPIC MODELS TO UNDERSTAND PREVALENT FACTORS CONCERNING MOTIVATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON TWITTER. THIRD, WE CREATED 2 SOCIAL NETWORKS TO INVESTIGATE ORGANICALLY ARISING PEER-SUPPORT NETWORK STRUCTURES FOR SUSTAINING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TO FORM A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FEASIBILITY OF THESE NETWORKS IN A REAL-WORLD CONTEXT. RESULTS: WE COLLECTED OVER 1.5 MILLION PHYSICAL ACTIVITY-RELATED TWEETS POSTED FROM AUGUST 30 TO NOVEMBER 6, 2018. A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TWEETS MENTIONED THE TERM MOTIVATION; MANY OF THESE WERE MADE ON MONDAYS OR DURING MORNING OR LATE MORNING HOURS. THE ANALYSIS OF RETWEETS SHOWED THAT THE FOLLOWING THREE THEMES WERE COMMONLY CONVEYED ON THE PLATFORM: (1) USING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOTIVATION (SELF, PROCESS, CONSOLATION, MENTAL, OR QUOTES), (2) PROMOTING INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS, AND (3) SHARING OR REQUESTING INFORMATION. TOPIC MODELS REVEALED THAT MANY OF THESE USERS WERE WEIGHTLIFTERS OR PEOPLE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT. TWITTER USERS ALSO NATURALLY FORGED RELATIONS, EVEN THOUGH 98.12\% (2824/2878) OF THESE USERS WERE IN DIFFERENT PHYSICAL LOCATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY FILLS A KNOWLEDGE GAP ON HOW INDIVIDUALS ORGANICALLY USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO ENCOURAGE AND SUSTAIN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. ELEMENTS RELATED TO PEER SUPPORT ARE FOUND IN THE ORGANIC USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION IS LESS IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING PEER SUPPORT AS LONG AS THE SUPPORT PROVIDES MOTIVATION, DESPITE USERS HAVING FEW FACTORS IN COMMON (EG, THE WEATHER) AFFECTING THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THIS PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY SUCCESSFUL MOTIVATION-PROVIDING PEER SUPPORT GROUPS IN A LARGE USER BASE. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS IN A REAL-WORLD CONTEXT, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DESIGN AND USABILITY FEATURES FOR IMPROVING USER ENGAGEMENT, ARE WARRANTED TO DEVELOP A SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION COUNTERACTING THE CURRENT OBESITY PANDEMIC.

INDUSTRY FUNDING IS CONTENTIOUS AS IT INFLUENCES STUDY OUTCOMES, AND IS NOT ALWAYS DISCLOSED IN SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED INDUSTRY SUPPORT ON THR PUBLICATIONS VIA SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. METHODS WE REVIEWED 826 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MANUSCRIPTS (1992-2016) TO DETERMINE DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED INDUSTRY (PHARMACEUTICAL, TOBACCO, AND E-CIGARETTE) AND NON-INDUSTRY (INCLUDING GOVERNMENT) SUPPORT RECEIVED BY 1405 AUTHORS. WE USED SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AUTHORS IN THR DISCOURSE BY ASSESSING THE NUMBER OF THEIR COLLABORATORS ON PUBLICATIONS, THE FREQUENCY OF CONNECTING OTHER AUTHORS IN THE NETWORK, AND TENDENCY TO FORM GROUPS BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF SPONSORSHIP DISCLOSURES, SOURCES OF FUNDING, AND THR STANCE. RESULTS ABOUT 284 (20\%) OUT OF 1405 AUTHORS WERE SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY-SPONSORED AUTHORS WERE MORE CENTRAL AND INFLUENTIAL IN THE NETWORK: WITH TWICE AS MANY PUBLICATIONS (MEDIAN = 4), 1.25 AS MANY COLLABORATORS ON PUBLICATIONS (MEDIAN = 5), AND HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CONNECTING OTHER AUTHORS AND THUS HAVING MORE INFLUENCE IN THE NETWORK, COMPARED TO NON-INDUSTRY-SPONSORED AUTHORS. E-CIGARETTE INDUSTRY-SPONSORED AUTHORS HAD THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATION WITH UNDISCLOSED INDUSTRY SUPPORT. CONCLUSIONS AUTHORS WITH INDUSTRY SUPPORT EXERTED A STRONGER INFLUENCE ON THE THR SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE THAN NON-INDUSTRY-SUPPORTED AUTHORS.

THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORKS MAY INFLUENCE THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE AND CLASSIFY INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORKS IN PRIMARY CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES IN GERMANY. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021. AS PART OF A LARGER PROJECT ON COORDINATION OF CARE, THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN PRACTICE TEAMS REGARDING PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (DM), CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) AND CHRONIC HEART FAILURE (CHF). SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS, DENSITY AND CENTRALIZATION FOR EACH OF THE HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR EACH OF THE PRACTICES. ON THE BASIS OF THE DESCRIPTIVE FINDINGS, WE DEVELOPED TYPOLOGIES OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE NETWORKS IN PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES. RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 153 HEALTH WORKERS FROM 40 PRACTICES, OF WHICH 25 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. FOUR TYPES OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE STRUCTURES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR THE THREE CHRONIC DISEASES: HIGHLY CONNECTED NETWORKS WITH LOW HIERARCHY, MEDIUM CONNECTED NETWORKS WITH MEDIUM HIERARCHY, MEDIUM CONNECTED NETWORKS WITH LOW HIERARCHY AND LOWLY CONNECTED NETWORKS.

ELIMINATING THE DISEASE REQUIRES COLLABORATION AMONG IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT, COMMUNITY, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTATIVES WORKING ON SCHISTOSOMIASIS. THE CURRENT LEVEL OF COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION AMONG THESE REPRESENTATIVES IN OYO STATE, NIGERIA IS UNKNOWN. THIS STUDY AIMED TO MEASURE THE EXTENT AND STRENGTH OF COLLABORATION AMONG THESE REPRESENTATIVES LOOKING AT THREE RELATIONSHIPS: CONTACT, COLLABORATION AND RESOURCE SHARING ACTIVITIES USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS METHOD. UNDERTAKING THIS RESEARCH WILL SUPPORT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BARRIERS AGAINST MEETING THE DISEASE ELIMINATION DEADLINE. THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THE THREE RELATIONSHIPS PATTERNS HAD CONSIDERABLE CLUSTERING AMONG REPRESENTATIVES AND FEW CONNECTIONS, SIGNIFYING LOW INTERCONNECTEDNESS ACROSS SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS. THE CONTACT AND COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WERE THE MOST ACTIVE, WITH THE RESOURCE-SHARING NETWORK HAVING THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS. REPRESENTATIVES WERE MORE ACTIVE IN RURAL AREAS THAN URBAN, AND REPRESENTATIVES IN THE ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WERE THE MOST ACTIVE ACTORS IN THE SCHISTOSOMIASIS CONTROL PROGRAM.

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN OYO STATE, NIGERIA USING 2 LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS (LGAS): IBADAN NORTH (URBAN) AND AKINYELE (RURAL). STAKEHOLDERS WERE IDENTIFIED USING A LINK-TRACING APPROACH. DATA WAS COLLECTED USING QUALTRICS SOFTWARE FROM STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE, ACADEMIA, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. DATA WAS ANALYSED USING GEPHI SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK COHESION ACROSS THE THREE NETWORKS. RESULTSTHE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS REVEALED HIGH CLUSTERING AND LOW DENSITY ACROSS THE THREE NETWORKS IMPLYING LOW COHESION ACROSS MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES. THE CONTACT AND COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS WERE THE MOST ACTIVE WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OF COHESION SEEN IN THE RESOURCE-SHARING NETWORK. STAKEHOLDERS WERE MORE ACTIVE IN THE RURAL LGA THAN THE URBAN, AND STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE ORGANIZED GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WERE THE DOMINANT ACTORS IN THE SCHISTOSOMIASIS CONTROL PROGRAM.

TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE WHETHER, WHEN OR WHERE WILD ANIMALS TAKE RISKS BY INTERACTING WITH HUMANS AND ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS STILL REMAINS UNCLEAR. WE ADOPT A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA). SNA, INCREASINGLY IMPLEMENTED TO DETERMINE HUMAN IMPACT ON WILDLIFE ECOLOGY, CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO UNDERSTAND HOW ANIMAL SOCIOECOLOGY INFLUENCES THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS. FOR 10 GROUPS OF RHESUS, LONG-TAILED AND BONNET MACAQUES (MACACA SPP.) LIVING IN ANTHROPOGENICALLY IMPACTED ENVIRONMENTS IN ASIA, WE COLLECTED DATA ON HUMAN-MACAQUE INTERACTIONS, ANIMAL DEMOGRAPHICS, AND MACAQUE-MACAQUE AGONISTIC AND AFFILIATIVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. WE CONSTRUCTED `HUMAN CO-INTERACTION NETWORKS' BASED ON ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MACAQUES THAT INTERACTED WITH HUMANS WITHIN THE SAME TIME AND SPATIAL LOCATIONS, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS BASED ON MACAQUE-MACAQUE ALLOGROOMING BEHAVIOUR, AFFILIATIVE BEHAVIOURS OF SHORT DURATION (AGONISTIC SUPPORT, LIP-SMACKING, SILENT BARE-TEETH DISPLAYS AND NON-SEXUAL MOUNTING) AND PROXIMITY. PRE-NETWORK PERMUTATION TESTS REVEALED THAT, WITHIN ALL MACAQUE GROUPS, SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS JOINTLY TOOK RISKS BY REPEATEDLY, CONSISTENTLY CO-INTERACTING WITH HUMANS WITHIN AND ACROSS TIME AND SPACE. GLMMS REVEALED THAT MACAQUES' TENDENCIES TO CO-INTERACT WITH HUMANS WAS POSITIVELY PREDICTED BY THEIR TENDENCIES TO ENGAGE IN SHORT-DURATION AFFILIATIVE INTERACTIONS AND TOLERANCE OF CONSPECIFICS, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER VARIED ACROSS SPECIES (BONNETS>RHESUS>LONG-TAILED). MALE MACAQUES WERE MORE LIKELY TO CO-INTERACT WITH HUMANS THAN FEMALES. NEITHER MACAQUES' GROOMING RELATIONSHIPS NOR THEIR DOMINANCE RANKS PREDICTED THEIR TENDENCIES TO CO-INTERACT WITH HUMANS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IN CHALLENGING ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTS, LESS (COMPARED TO MORE) TIME-CONSUMING FORMS OF AFFILIATION, AND ADDITIONALLY GREATER SOCIAL TOLERANCE IN LESS ECOLOGICALLY FLEXIBLE SPECIES WITH A SHORTER HISTORY OF EXPOSURE TO HUMANS, MAY BE KEY TO ANIMALS' JOINT PROPENSITIES TO TAKE RISKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO RESOURCES. FOR MALES, GREATER EXPLORATORY TENDENCIES AND LESS ENERGETICALLY DEMANDING LONG-TERM LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES (COMPARED TO FEMALES) MAY ALSO INFLUENCE SUCH JOINT RISK-TAKING.

CONTACT TRACING DATA COULD ALSO BE POTENTIALLY USED FOR ASSESSING THE HETEROGENEITY OF TRANSMISSION AT THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT LEVEL. CHARACTERIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INFECTIOUSNESS COULD BETTER INFORM THE CONTACT TRACING INTERVENTIONS AT FIELD LEVELS. METHODS STANDARD SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS METHODS USED FOR EXPLORING INFECTIOUS DISEASE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE CONTACT TRACING DATA OF 1959 DIAGNOSED SARS-COV-2 PATIENTS FROM A LARGE STATE OF INDIA. RELATIONAL NETWORK DATA SET WITH DIAGNOSED PATIENTS AS ``NODES'' AND THEIR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONTACT AS ``EDGES'' WAS CREATED. DIRECTED NETWORK PERSPECTIVE WAS UTILIZED IN WHICH DIRECTIONALITY OF INFECTION EMANATED FROM A ``SOURCE PATIENT'' TOWARDS A ``TARGET PATIENT''. NETWORK MEASURES OF ``DEGREE CENTRALITY'' AND ``BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY'' WERE CALCULATED TO IDENTIFY INFLUENTIAL PATIENTS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION. COMPONENTS ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS CONNECTED AS SUB - GROUPS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WAS USED TO SUMMARISE NETWORK MEASURES AND PERCENTILE RANKS WERE USED TO CATEGORIZE INFLUENCERS. RESULTS OUT-DEGREE CENTRALITY MEASURES IDENTIFIED THAT OF THE TOTAL 1959 PATIENTS, 11.27\% (221) PATIENTS HAVE ACTED AS A SOURCE OF INFECTION TO 40.19\% (787) OTHER PATIENTS. AMONG THESE SOURCE PATIENTS, 0.65\% (12) PATIENTS HAD A HIGHER OUT-DEGREE CENTRALITY (> = 10) AND HAVE COLLECTIVELY INFECTED 37.61\% (296 OF 787), SECONDARY PATIENTS. BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY MEASURES HIGHLIGHTED THAT 7.50\% (93) PATIENTS HAD A NON-ZERO BETWEENNESS (RANGE 0.5 TO 135) AND THUS HAVE BRIDGED THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN OTHER PATIENTS.

THE APPLICATION OF REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH PRINCIPLES FOUNDED ON TEXT-AS-DATA INFORMATION, OPEN SCIENCE, THE DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC DATA, AND EASY ACCESS TO SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION MAY AID PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE VIRUS. OBJECTIVE: THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PAPER WAS TO USE GLOBAL RESEARCH ON CORONAVIRUSES TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ELEMENTS THAT CAN HELP INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY DECISIONS. WE PRESENT A DATA SCIENCE FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST POLICY MAKERS IN IMPLEMENTING CUTTING-EDGE DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING EVIDENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. METHODS: WE USED THE EPIBIBR (EPIDEMIOLOGY-BASED BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR R) PACKAGE TO GAIN ACCESS TO CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH DOCUMENTS WORLDWIDE (N=121,231) AND THEIR ASSOCIATED METADATA. TO ANALYZE THESE DATA, WE FIRST EMPLOYED A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO GROUP THE FINDINGS INTO THREE CATEGORIES: CONCEPTUAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND SOCIAL. SECOND, WE MAPPED THE RESULTS OF OUR ANALYSIS IN THESE THREE DIMENSIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES (IE, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING) AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS.

IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO COPE WITH THIS CHALLENGE REQUIRES COMMITMENT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT VARIOUS LEVELS, AND ALL NECESSARY RESOURCES SHOULD BE MOBILISED. SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS HCV-RELATED STAKEHOLDERS CAN REDUCE THE CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES THAT CAN BE ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED WITH HCV-RELATED POLICY-MAKING IN IRAN AT DIFFERENT STEPS (POLICY DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION) AND TO CHARACTERISE THEM IN TERMS OF INTEREST, POSITION, POWER AND INFLUENCE, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR APPROPRIATE DECISION-MAKING AND DESIGN. THE PRESENT STUDY CAN ALSO SERVE AS A CASE STUDY FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. METHOD: AN APPROACH BASED ON SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS UTILISED. DATA COLLECTED INCLUDED RELEVANT DOCUMENT SEARCHES AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS TO A SAMPLE OF 18 KEY INFORMANTS. RESULTS: VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WERE FOUND TO BE INVOLVED WITH HCV-RELATED POLICIES IN IRAN. THE EXTENT OF THEIR PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORT IN POLICY-MAKING VARIED. SPECIFICALLY, INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES HAD A HIGH INTEREST FOR HCV-RELATED POLICY-MAKING, WHEREAS MEDIA AND MEMBERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WERE CHARACTERISED BY A MEDIUM INTEREST AND GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL BODIES BY A HIGHLY VARIABLE INTEREST, RANGING FROM LOW TO HIGH, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC ORGANISM. MOREOVER, MEDIA AND MEMBERS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, NON-GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES WERE RATED LOW IN TERMS OF POSITION, WHEREAS GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS WERE RATED LOW TO HIGH.

SOCIAL MEDIA WAS USED INTENSIVELY AND WITH IMPUNITY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THEREBY PROVIDES A WINDOW INTO THE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT DYNAMICS OF DAILY LIFE AFTER A DISASTER. WE AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW A POST-DISASTER ENVIRONMENT POTENTIALLY GENERATES NEW UNCERTAINTIES OR EXACERBATING PRE-EXISTING ONES FOR MIGRANTS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS WITH AN INDIRECT PERSPECTIVE, IN THE CONTEXT OF 2023-EARTHQUAKE IN TURKIYE AND SYRIAN MIGRANTS. METHODSSOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE TWITTER-DATA WITH THE HASHTAGS `SYRIAN' AND `EARTHQUAKE' DURING A 10-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING ON MARCH 22ND, 2023. WE CALCULATED NETWORK METRICS, INCLUDING DEGREE-VALUES AND BETWEENNESS-CENTRALITY AND CLUSTERED THE NETWORK TO UNDERSTAND GROUPS. WE ANALYZED A COMBINATION OF 27 TWEETS WITH SUMMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS USING A TEXT ANALYSIS TOOL, TO IDENTIFY THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED WORDS. WE IDENTIFIED THE MAIN POINTS OF EACH TWEET AND ASSESSED THESE AS POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTORS TO POST-DISASTER UNCERTAINTY AMONG MIGRANTS BY USING INDUCTIVE REASONING. RESULTSTHERE WERE 1918 TWITTER USERS, 274 TWEETS, 124 REPLIES AND 1726 MENTIONS. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SYRIAN MIGRANTS AND EARTHQUAKES WERE ESTABLISHED ACROSS VARIOUS GROUPS (N(GROUPS(EDGES > 15)) = 16).

METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES PERMIT SIMULTANEOUS MODELING OF THESE CONTEXTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RELATIVE AND JOINT IMPORTANCE. FEW EMPIRICAL STUDIES INCLUDE THESE CONTEXTS, AND STUDIES THAT DO TYPICALLY: EXAMINE EACH CONTEXT SEPARATELY; INCLUDE CONTEXTS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ACCOUNTING FOR CLUSTERING IN THE DATA; OR DO NOT DISAGGREGATE BY SEX.OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY TAKES AN ECO-EPIDEMIOLOGIC APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF SOCIO-CONTEXTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO VARIANCE IN ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE. THE PRIMARY PARAMETERS OF INTEREST ARE THEREFORE VARIANCE RATHER THAN BETA PARAMETERS (I.E. RANDOM RATHER THAN FIXED EFFECTS). SEX-STRATIFIED MODELS ARE ALSO USED TO UNDERSTAND HOW EACH CONTEXT MAY MATTER DIFFERENTLY FOR MALE AND FEMALE ADOLESCENTS.METHOD: DATA COME FROM THE NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF ADOLESCENT TO ADULT HEALTH (N = 8,534 FEMALES, N = 8,102 MALES). WE CONDUCT SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND TRADITIONAL AND CROSS-CLASSIFIED MULTILEVEL MODELS (CCMM) IN THE FULL AND SEX-DISAGGREGATED SAMPLES.RESULTS: IN FINAL CCMM, PEER GROUPS, SCHOOLS, AND NEIGHBORHOODS CONTRIBUTED 10.5\%, 10.8\%, AND 0.4\%, RESPECTIVELY, TO TOTAL VARIATION IN ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE. RESULTS DO NOT DIFFER WIDELY BY GENDER.CONCLUSIONS: PEER GROUPS AND SCHOOLS EMERGE AS MORE SALIENT CONTRIBUTING CONTEXTS RELATIVE TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE FOR MALES AND FEMALES. THESE FINDINGS HAVE BOTH METHODOLOGICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS.

FIRST, WE DEPLOYED SPATIAL SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY HUBS (CENSUS TRACTS THAT ARE FOCAL POINTS OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DISCORDANT OVERDOSES) AND AUTHORITIES (THE COMMUNITIES OF RESIDENCE FROM WHICH JOURNEYS TO OVERDOSE COMMONLY BEGIN) FOR OVERDOSE DEATHS AND CHARACTERIZED THEM AC-CORDING TO KEY DEMOGRAPHICS. SECOND, WE USED TEMPORAL TREND ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES THAT WERE CONSISTENT, SPORADIC, AND EMERGENT HOTSPOTS FOR OVERDOSE DEATHS. THIRD, WE IDENTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS THAT DIFFERENTIATED DISCORDANT VERSUS NON-DISCORDANT OVERDOSE DEATHS. RESULTS: AUTHORITY COMMUNITIES HAD LOWER HOUSING STABILITY AND WERE YOUNGER, MORE IMPOVERISHED, AND LESS EDUCATED RELATIVE TO HUBS AND COUNTY-WIDE NUMBERS. WHITE COMMUNITIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE HUBS, WHILE HISPANIC COMMUNITIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE AUTHORITIES.

LEVERAGING SYSTEMS SCIENCE METHODS OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES TO APPROACH PA IN A MANNER WHICH EMBRACES ITS INHERENT COMPLEXITY. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES HOW PARTICIPATORY SYSTEMS MAPPING AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) WERE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL WALKING SYSTEMS IN IRELAND. METHODS TWO ADAPTED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH WORKSHOPS WITH MULTISECTORAL STAKEHOLDERS WERE USED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMS MAP FOR WALKING IN CORK, IRELAND. THE GLOBAL ACTION PLAN FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 2018-2030 (GAPPA) MAP WAS USED AS A FRAMEWORK TO CATEGORIZE WORKSHOP OUTCOMES. SECONDLY, SNA METHODS WERE USED TO ANALYSE THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK BETWEEN PARTNERS OF GET IRELAND WALKING, A NATIONAL WALKING PROMOTION INITIATIVE, AS DEFINED WITHIN THEIR STRATEGIC PLAN AND THE ACTUAL COMMUNICATION NETWORK AS EXPERIENCED BY THE PARTNERS. RESULTS THE SYSTEMS MAPPING PROCESS ALLOWED STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY 19 SUGGESTED ACTIONS FOR THE CORK WALKING SYSTEM. THE SNA FOUND THAT THERE WERE CONSIDERABLY FEWER COMMUNICATION TIES BETWEEN PARTNERS IN THE ACTUAL COMMUNICATION NETWORK THAN IN THE STRATEGY DEFINED NETWORK. CONCLUSION THE SYSTEMS MAPPING PROCESS WAS A USEFUL CATALYST FOR ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN CROSS-SECTORAL COMMUNICATION AND THE GAPPA WAS A PRACTICAL WAY TO ORGANIZE WORKSHOP OUTCOMES.

METHOD: THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY EVALUATED METADATA TO FIND ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS. MELEIS'S TRANSITION THEORY WAS SELECTED AS A CASE STUDY. A MAJORITY OF THE PUBLICATIONS THAT REPRESENTED THE TRANSITION THEORY WERE ASSIGNED AS THE CORE OF THE THEORY. FORWARD AND BACKWARD CITATIONS WERE USED AS AGENTS OF KNOWLEDGE LINKAGE TO DETERMINE THE DISSEMINATION OF THE THEORY IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION WERE USED TO DEPICT GRAPHICAL AND STRUCTURAL RELATIONS OF THE RESEARCH FRONT AND THE KNOWLEDGE BASE. RESULTS: THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF THE TRANSITION THEORY WAS BUILT ON 7 DIFFERENT INFORMATION NETWORKS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND VAST INFORMATION NETWORK CONSISTED OF MELEIS, AI AS A RESEARCHER AND THE CENTRAL INFORMATION NETWORK, WHICH IS THE JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH. ONCOLOGY, GERIATRICS, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND PSYCHOLOGY IN THE AREAS OF INFORMATION PROPAGATION WITHIN THE FIELD OF NURSING WERE CONSIDERED AS RESEARCH AREAS WHERE THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY THE THEORY WAS RENDERED FUNCTIONAL. CONCLUSION: IN RECENT YEARS, THE USE OF THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS HAS BECOME A NECESSITY TO ASSESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE STUDY OF NURSING SCIENCE. THE METHOD USED IN THE STUDY CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED TO ANALYZE THE CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES IN THE NURSING EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL APPLICATION PROCESSES AND TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF THESE THEORIES.

TO EFFECTIVELY HARNESS PROMISING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES AHEAD, PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MUST BE TRAINED ON EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES FOR PROTECTING AND IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS PROJECT SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE NETWORK OF HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE TRAINING IN ORDER TO INFORM STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO FILL TRAINING GAPS AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO TRAINING FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (LHDS), THEREBY STRENGTHENING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED SURVEY OF 501 LHDS IN THE 6 STATES CONSTITUTING REGION V OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \& HUMAN SERVICES. THE SURVEY FOCUSED ON THE TRAINING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LHDS AND STATE AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING, ALLOWING FOR A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. WE USED DATA VISUALIZATION AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS TO EXAMINE THE NETWORK. RESULTS: OF 290 PARTICIPATING HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (58\% RESPONSE RATE), 248 HAD MONTHLY OR MORE FREQUENT CONTACT WITH AT LEAST 1 ORGANIZATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRAINING. ALTOGETHER, THE 248 LHDS WERE CONNECTED TO 47 STATE-LEVEL ORGANIZATIONS AND 10 NATIONAL-LEVEL ORGANIZATIONS. IN 5 OF 6 STATES, MORE LHDS WERE CONNECTED TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR TRAINING THAN TO ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION TYPE. UNIVERSITIES, NATIONAL NONPROFITS, AND NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDED TRAINING TO THE FEWEST LHDS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT CHARACTERISTICS DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NUMBER OF TRAINING CONNECTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPORT OF UNIVERSITIES, NATIONAL NONPROFITS, AND NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS BY PARTNERING TO OFFER TRAINING OR BY RECOMMENDING TRAINING FROM THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO LHDS.

SUCH A NETWORK COULD PROVE VALUABLE DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SUCH AS THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER LHDS IN THE UNITED STATES WERE TIED TOGETHER IN AN INFORMAL NETWORK TO SHARE INFORMATION AND ADVICE ABOUT INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES, PROGRAMS, AND POLICIES. METHODS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2020, WE CONDUCTED AN ONLINE SURVEY OF 2,303 SENIOR LHD LEADERS TO ASK SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR SOURCES OF ADVICE. WE ASKED RESPONDENTS TO RANK UP TO 3 OTHER LHDS WHOSE PRACTICES INFORMED THEIR WORK ON NEW PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS, EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, AND POLICIES INTENDED TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH. WE USED A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PROGRAM TO ASSESS ANSWERS. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 329 LHDS RESPONDED. AN EMERGENT NETWORK APPEARED TO OPERATE NATIONALLY AMONG 740 LHDS.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RUMOR REBUTTAL, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IGNORED OR SIMPLIFIED THE STRUCTURE OF DISSEMINATION NETWORKS AND USERS' COGNITION AS WELL AS DECISION-MAKING AND INTERACTION BEHAVIORS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ROUGHLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RUMOR REBUTTAL; DIG DEEPLY INTO THE ATTITUDE-BASED ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON USERS' RESPONSES TO RUMOR REBUTTAL UNDER MULTIPLE TOPICS ON WEIBO, A CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC; AND EVALUATE THE ECHO CHAMBER'S IMPACT ON THE INFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS OF USER INTERACTION CONTENT. METHODS: WE USED SINA WEIBO'S APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE TO CRAWL RUMOR REBUTTAL CONTENT RELATED TO COVID-19 FROM 10 AM ON JANUARY 23, 2020, TO MIDNIGHT ON APRIL 8, 2020. USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, WE FIRST ANALYZED WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THERE WAS AN ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON THE SHAPING OF INDIVIDUALS' ATTITUDES WHEN RETWEETING OR COMMENTING ON OTHERS' TWEETS. THEN, WE TESTED THE HETEROGENEITY OF ATTITUDE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND THE HOMOPHILY OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THE RESULTS AT USER AND COMMUNITY LEVELS, WE MADE COMPREHENSIVE JUDGMENTS. FINALLY, WE EXAMINED USERS' INTERACTION CONTENT FROM THREE DIMENSIONS-SENTIMENT EXPRESSION, INFORMATION SEEKING AND SHARING, AND CIVILITY-TO TEST THE IMPACT OF THE ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE RETWEETING MECHANISM PLAYED AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN PROMOTING POLARIZATION, AND THE COMMENTING MECHANISM PLAYED A ROLE IN CONSENSUS BUILDING. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT ON COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS AND VERIFIED THAT, COMPARED TO LIKE-MINDED INTERACTIONS, CROSS-CUTTING INTERACTIONS CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT, INFORMATION SEEKING AND SHARING, AND INCIVILITY. WE FOUND THAT ONLINE USERS' INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY INCIVILITY, AND INFORMATION-SHARING BEHAVIOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT, WHICH WAS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY INCIVILITY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE AND DEGREE OF AN ECHO CHAMBER EFFECT FROM MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS, SUCH AS TOPIC, INTERACTION MECHANISM, AND INTERACTION LEVEL, AND ITS IMPACT ON INTERACTION CONTENT.

THE AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO ANALYSE THE STATIC AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PIG NETWORK, TO IDENTIFY ITS TRADING COMMUNITIES AND TO STUDY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE NETWORK TO THE TRANSMISSION OF CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER. IN THIS REGARD, WE USED THE PIG MOVEMENT RECORDS FROM THE NATIONAL VETERINARY SERVICE OF ECUADOR (2017-2019), USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS TO CONSTRUCT A NETWORK WITH REGISTERED PREMISES AS NODES AND THEIR MOVEMENTS AS EDGES. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO CREATED A NETWORK OF PARISHES AS ITS NODES BY AGGREGATING THEIR PREMISES MOVEMENTS AS EDGES. THE ANNUAL NETWORK METRICS SHOWED AN AVERAGE DIAMETER OF 20.33, A NUMBER OF NEIGHBOURS OF 2.61, A SHORTEST PATH LENGTH OF 4.39 AND A CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT OF 0.38 (SMALL-WORLD STRUCTURE). THE MOST FREQUENT MOVEMENTS WERE TO OR FROM MARKETS (55\%). BACKYARD PRODUCERS MADE UP 89\% OF THE NETWORK PREMISES, AND THE TOP 2\% OF PARISHES (HIGHEST DEGREE) CONTRIBUTED TO 50\% OF THE MOVEMENTS.

HOWEVER, IN PARTIAL NETWORKS WITH ONLY ADULT FEMALES, ONLY JUVENILES, OR RANDOM SUBSETS OF THE GROUP, THE STRENGTH OF THIS RELATIONSHIP - ALBEIT STILL GENERALLY POSITIVE - LOST STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. FURTHERMORE, KNOCK-OUT SIMULATIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED BUT NETWORK METRICS WERE RETAINED FROM THE ORIGINAL WHOLE-GROUP NETWORK SHOWED THAT THESE CHANGES ARE PARTLY A POWER ISSUE AND PARTLY AN EFFECT OF SAMPLING THE INCOMPLETE NETWORK. OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT SAMPLING BIAS CAN THUS HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO DETECT REAL NETWORK EFFECTS INVOLVING SOCIAL INTERACTION AND PARASITISM. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING EARLIER RESULTS LINKING GEOHELMINTH INFECTION TO JAPANESE MACAQUE SOCIAL NETWORKS, THIS WORK INTRODUCES IMPORTANT METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCH INTO THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIAL TRANSMISSION, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, POPULATION MANAGEMENT, AND HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.","10.7717/peerj.14305","2167-8359","PEERJ",NA,"LINKING PARASITISM TO NETWORK CENTRALITY AND THE IMPACT OF SAMPLING BIAS IN ITS INTERPRETATION","10",2022,"ISI","PEERJ",0,"none",NA,NA,"XU Z, 2022, PEERJ","XU Z, 2022, PEERJ"

SPECIFICALLY, WE WANTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATTERNS OF CONNECTIVITY OVER TIME CAN PREDICT FUTURE INFECTIONS, AND WHETHER THIS PATTERN CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFECTION. THE STUDY POPULATION INCLUDED 13,409 INDIVIDUALS NESTED IN A LARGER POPULATION OF BIRDS THAT WERE CLOSELY MONITORED IN ZOOLOGICAL FACILITIES FOR OVER 22 YEARS (1992-2014). A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY DESIGN AND SOCIAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO AN INFECTED BIRD, AND DEVELOPMENT OF MYCOBACTERIOSIS. AVIAN MYCOBACTERIOSIS WAS DIAGNOSED FROM HISTOPATHOLOGY AND NETWORK CONNECTIVITY WAS DEFINED BY ENCLOSURE HISTORIES OVER DISCRETE TIME PERIODS. SINGLE-VARIABLE AND MULTIVARIABLE LONGITUDINAL, MIXED EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS EXAMINED WHETHER EXPOSURE TO INFECTED BIRDS, BOTH DIRECTLY- AND INDIRECTLY-CONNECTED, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF MYCOBACTERIOSIS AT THE NEXT TIME STEP. OUR ADJUSTED MODEL SHOWED AN INCREASED ODDS OF DEVELOPING MYCOBACTERIOSIS (ODDS RATIO = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; P < 0.001) FOR BIRDS THAT WERE DIRECTLY EXPOSED (I.E., HOUSED IN THE SAME AVIARY) TO ANOTHER INFECTED BIRD, COMPARED TO THOSE WITH NO EXPOSURE. EXPOSURE TO A POSITIVE, INDIRECTLY-CONNECTED BIRD AT A PREVIOUS TIME STEP WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF MYCOBACTERIOSIS (ODDS RATIO = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). THIS ASSOCIATION PERSISTED IN ADJUSTED MODELS EVEN WHEN THE INDIRECT CONTACTS WERE HOUSED IN DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT AVIARIES AND NEVER HAD CONTACT WITH THE SUBJECT OF INTEREST OR ITS ENVIRONMENT. ADJUSTED, RISK-STRATIFIED MODELS FURTHER CHARACTERIZED THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE THAT INCREASED THE RISK OF AVIAN MYCOBACTERIOSIS. BIRDS THAT WERE EXPOSED IN SMALL AVIARIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP MYCOBACTERIOSIS THAN THOSE EXPOSED IN LARGER AVIARIES AND THOSE WITH NO EXPOSURE. THE LESION DISTRIBUTION AND SPECIES OF THE CONTACT (SAME SPECIES VERSUS DIFFERENT SPECIES) WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DISEASE RISK. SOME FINDINGS WERE SENSITIVE TO MODEL VARIATION OF TIME DIVISIONS AND INITIATION TIME.

NETWORK COMPOSITION MAY AFFECT PRIORITIES, PROCESSES, AND THE REACH OF HEALTH INFORMATION TO KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO ELUCIDATE VARIATION IN LOCAL NETWORK STRUCTURES TO EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT CONSTELLATIONS MAY AFFECT INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS AUDIENCES. DESIGN: THIS STUDY ANALYZES DATA FROM A 2016 US SURVEY OF 491 METROPOLITAN LHDS AND 556 NONMETROPOLITAN LHDS. RESEARCHERS FIRST CONDUCTED SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF NETWORK DENSITY, DEFINED AS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS CONTRIBUTING TO A JURISDICTION'S HEALTH COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES. RESEARCHERS THEN CONDUCTED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO COMPARE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NETWORK DENSITY AND REPORTED HEALTH COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES TARGETING 3 SPECIFIC AUDIENCES: POLICY MAKERS, LAY PUBLICS, AND MASS MEDIA. RESULTS: THREE NETWORK TYPES EMERGED ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES, WITH LOW-DENSITY MINIMAL NETWORKS MORE COMMON IN NONMETROPOLITAN JURISDICTIONS AND HIGHER-DENSITY EXPANDED AND ROBUST NETWORKS MORE COMMON IN METROPOLITAN JURISDICTIONS. LHDS IN MINIMAL NETWORKS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO COMMUNICATE WITH POLICY MAKERS, LAY PUBLICS, AND MASS MEDIA THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN HIGHER-DENSITY NETWORKS (P < .05).

THESE AUTOMATIC SOLUTIONS WILL HELP REDUCE THE NEED FOR MANUAL ANALYSIS OF CONTENT. MOST PREVIOUS LITERATURE HAS CAST THE HATE SPEECH DETECTION PROBLEM AS A SUPERVISED TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASK USING CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS OR, MORE RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING METHODS. HOWEVER, WORK INVESTIGATING THIS PROBLEM IN ARABIC CYBERSPACE IS STILL LIMITED COMPARED TO THE PUBLISHED WORK ON ENGLISH TEXT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY HATE SPEECH RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC POSTED BY TWITTER USERS IN THE ARAB REGION AND TO DISCOVER THE MAIN ISSUES DISCUSSED IN TWEETS CONTAINING HATE SPEECH. METHODS: WE USED THE ARCOV-19 DATASET, AN ONGOING COLLECTION OF ARABIC TWEETS RELATED TO COVID-19, STARTING FROM JANUARY 27, 2020. TWEETS WERE ANALYZED FOR HATE SPEECH USING A PRETRAINED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL; EACH TWEET WAS GIVEN A SCORE BETWEEN 0 AND 1, WITH 1 BEING THE MOST HATEFUL TEXT. WE ALSO USED NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION TO DISCOVER THE MAIN ISSUES AND TOPICS DISCUSSED IN HATE TWEETS. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS OF HATE SPEECH IN TWITTER DATA IN THE ARAB REGION IDENTIFIED THAT THE NUMBER OF NON-HATE TWEETS GREATLY EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF HATE TWEETS, WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF HATE TWEETS AMONG COVID-19 RELATED TWEETS WAS 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT THE MAJORITY OF HATE TWEETS (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) CONTAINED A LOW LEVEL OF HATE BASED ON THE SCORE PROVIDED BY THE CNN. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED SAUDI ARABIA AS THE ARAB COUNTRY FROM WHICH THE MOST COVID-19 HATE TWEETS ORIGINATED DURING THE PANDEMIC. FURTHERMORE, WE SHOWED THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HATE TWEETS APPEARED DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF MARCH 1-30, 2020, REPRESENTING 51.9\% OF ALL HATE TWEETS (6095/11,743). CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED, IN THE ARAB REGION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19-RELATED HATE SPEECH ON TWITTER WAS WEAKLY RELATED WITH THE DISSEMINATION OF THE PANDEMIC BASED ON THE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (R=0.1982, P=.50). THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED THE COMMONLY DISCUSSED TOPICS IN HATE TWEETS DURING THE PANDEMIC. ANALYSIS OF THE 7 EXTRACTED TOPICS SHOWED THAT 6 OF THE 7 IDENTIFIED TOPICS WERE RELATED TO HATE SPEECH AGAINST CHINA AND IRAN. ARAB USERS ALSO DISCUSSED TOPICS RELATED TO POLITICAL CONFLICTS IN THE ARAB REGION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC POSES SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES TO NATIONS WORLDWIDE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FREQUENT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF HATE SPEECH.

DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) APPROACH TO ASSESS THE MILLION HEARTS INITIATIVE NETWORK PARTNERSHIPS AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: THE MILLION HEARTS NETWORK COMPRISED A CORE GROUP OF FEDERAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN MILLION HEARTS ACTIVITIES AND ALIGN WITH INITIATIVE PRIORITIES. TO BOUND THE NETWORK FOR THE SNA, WE USED A LIST OF 58 ORGANIZATIONS (74\% RESPONSE RATE) FROM A PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF MILLION HEARTS PARTNERSHIPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WE USED THE ONLINE PARTNER (PROGRAM TO ANALYZE RECORD AND TRACK NETWORKS TO ENHANCE RELATIONSHIPS-) SURVEY TO COLLECT DATA ON INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND RELATIONAL QUESTIONS THAT ASKED ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PARTNERS IN THE NETWORK. KEY SNA MEASURES INCLUDE NETWORK DENSITY, CENTRALIZATIONS, VALUE, AND TRUST. RESULTS: OUR ANALYSES SHOW A NETWORK THAT IS DECENTRALIZED, HAS STRONG PERCEPTIONS OF TRUST AND VALUE AMONG ITS MEMBERS, AND STRONG AGREEMENT ON INTENDED OUTCOMES. INTERESTINGLY, PARTNERS REPORT A DESIRE AND ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE RESOURCES TO MILLION HEARTS; HOWEVER, THE PERCEPTIONS BETWEEN PARTNERS ARE THAT RESOURCES ARE NOT BEING CONTRIBUTED AT THE LEVEL THEY POTENTIALLY COULD BE. THE MAJORITY OF PARTNERS REPORTED THAT BEING IN THE NETWORK HELPED THEM ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION. THE LARGEST BARRIER TO SUCCESSFUL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE NETWORK WAS CITED AS LACK OF TARGETED FUNDING AND STAFF TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION IN THE NETWORK. CONCLUSIONS: THE MILLION HEARTS NETWORK DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE IS UNIQUE IN ITS MEMBERSHIP AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AGREEMENT ON OUTCOMES, ITS POWERFUL INFORMATION-SHARING ABILITIES THAT REQUIRE FEW RESOURCES, AND ITS DECENTRALIZED STRUCTURE. WE IDENTIFIED STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO STRENGTHEN THE NETWORK AND ITS ACTIVITIES.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO CHARACTERISE PIG PREMISES ACCORDING TO RISK CRITERIA, TO MODEL THE EFFECT OF MOVEMENT RESTRICTION STRATEGIES AND TO CONSIDER THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE NETWORK. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA), SIRS (SUSCEPTIBLE, INFECTED, RECOVERED, SUSCEPTIBLE) NETWORK MODELLING AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS WERE USED. THE NETWORK CONTAINED 751,003 SHIPMENTS AND 6 MILLION PIGS FROM 2017 TO 2019. PARTICIPATING PREMISES CONSISTED OF 144,118 BACKYARD FARMS, 138 INDUSTRIAL FARMS, 21,337 TRADERS AND 51 MARKETS. THE 10 MOST INFLUENTIAL MARKETS, IN THE ANDEAN HIGHLANDS, RECEIVED BETWEEN 500 AND 4600 PIGS EACH WEEK. THE 10 MOST INFLUENTIAL TRADERS MADE ABOUT 3 SHIPMENTS WITH 17 PIGS PER WEEK. SIMULATIONS WITHOUT CONTROL STRATEGY RESULTED IN AN AVERAGE CSF PREVALENCE OF 14.4 \%; TARGETED MOVEMENT RESTRICTION REDUCED THE PREVALENCE TO 7.2 \%, WHILE WITH RANDOM MOVEMENT RESTRICTION IT WAS 13 \%. TARGETING THE TOP 10 NATIONAL TRADERS AND MARKETS AND ONE OF THE HIGH-RISK PREMISES IN EVERY PARISH WAS ONE OF THE BEST STRATEGIES WITH THE SURVEILLANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE, HIGHLIGHTING ITS MAJOR INFLUENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE IN THE NETWORK.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY REPORTS THE USER-CENTERED DESIGN AND FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A CHATBOT TO COLLECT LINKED DATA TO SUPPORT THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY CAUSES IN POPULATIONS. METHODS: WE FIRST STUDIED THE USERS' NEEDS AND GATHERED USERS' GRAPHICAL PREFERENCES THROUGH AN OPEN SURVEY ON 52 WIREFRAMES DESIGNED BY 150 DESIGN STUDENTS; IT ALSO INCLUDED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, DIET AND ACTIVITY HABITS, THE NEED FOR OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY APPS, AND DESIRED FUNCTIONALITY. WE ALSO INTERVIEWED AN EXPERT PANEL. WE THEN DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED A CHATBOT. FINALLY, WE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY TO TEST FEASIBILITY. RESULTS: WE COLLECTED 452 ANSWERS TO THE SURVEY AND INTERVIEWED 4 SPECIALISTS. BASED ON THIS RESEARCH, WE DEVELOPED A TELEGRAM CHATBOT NAMED WAKAMOLA STRUCTURED IN SIX SECTIONS: PERSONAL, DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SOCIAL NETWORK, USER'S STATUS SCORE, AND PROJECT INFORMATION. WE DEFINED A USER'S STATUS SCORE AS A NORMALIZED SUM (0-100) OF SCORES ABOUT DIET (FREQUENCY OF EATING 50 FOODS), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BMI, AND SOCIAL NETWORK. WE PERFORMED A PILOT TO EVALUATE THE CHATBOT IMPLEMENTATION AMONG 85 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. OF 74 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED ALL SECTIONS, WE FOUND 8 UNDERWEIGHT PEOPLE (11\%), 5 OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE (7\%), AND NO OBESITY CASES. THE MEAN BMI WAS 21.4 KG/M(2) (NORMAL WEIGHT).

METHODS THIS PAPER IS THE FIRST TO EMPIRICALLY ANALYSE COMMERCIAL ACTORS' ENGAGEMENT IN AN E-CIGARETTE POLICY CONSULTATION PROCESS AND TO EXAMINE THEIR VIEWS ON PROPOSED REGULATION. IT APPLIES MIXED METHODS, DRAWING ON POLICY CONSULTATION SUBMISSIONS (N=32), SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N=9) AND A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF WEBSITE LINKS AMONG 32 COMMERCIAL ACTORS. RESULTS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COMMERCIAL ACTORS' POSITIONS ON E-CIGARETTE REGULATION ALIGNED WITH BUSINESS INTERESTS. TTCS, INDEPENDENT E-CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER NON-LICENSED COMMERCIAL ACTORS WERE OPPOSED TO MOST ASPECTS OF POTENTIAL E-CIGARETTE REGULATION (EXCEPT FOR AGE OF SALE RESTRICTIONS), WHEREAS LICENSED COMMERCIAL ACTORS, INCLUDING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, SUPPORTED MORE STRINGENT REGULATION.

COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS OFFER PARTICULAR PROMISE, BUT DELIVERY AND SUSTAINMENT OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES THROUGH THESE SYSTEMS FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO SERVICE INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION. WE USED A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE TO EXPLORE (A) THE RANGE OF CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIP NETWORK MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND (B) IMPORTANT INFLUENCES ON THE ABILITY OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS TO SUSTAIN SERVICE DELIVERY. METHODS:DATA COME FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION OF THE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS TRUST FUND INITIATIVE, WHICH SUPPORTED NINE MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITIES TO COORDINATE DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION AND ADDRESS INEQUITIES IN HYPERTENSION, PEDIATRIC ASTHMA, FALLS AMONG OLDER ADULTS, OR TOBACCO USE. IN 2016, WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH (A) LEADERSHIP TEAMS REPRESENTING NINE COMMUNITY-LEVEL PARTNERSHIPS AND (B) PRACTITIONERS FROM FOUR HIGH-IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERSHIPS (N= 23). WE MANAGED DATA USING NVIVO11 AND UTILIZED A FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS APPROACH. RESULTS:KEY NETWORK CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTIVE SERVICES INCLUDED CREATING REFERRALS, DELIVERING SERVICES, PROVIDING LINKS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND ADMINISTRATION AND LEADERSHIP.

WE FIRST DISCUSS THE NETWORKS EMBEDDED IN THE PARASITE LIFE CYCLE THAT PROPAGATES DISEASE TRANSMISSION. THEN, WE COLLECT 820 QUESTIONNAIRES FROM THREE PROVINCES IN NORTHEAST THAILAND TO VISUALIZE THEIR FISH-SHARING AND SHARING-PROCUREMENT NETWORKS, ANALYZE HOW THE CONNECTIVITY DIFFERENCES IN THESE NETWORKS MIGHT BE LINKED TO PARTICIPANTS' CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS, AND DETERMINE HOW ALL THESE TOGETHER AFFECT LIVER FLUKE INFECTION RISKS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INFECTION WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PROCURING FISH FROM PONDS, BUT NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PROCURING FISH FROM RIVERS. INCORPORATING FISH PROCUREMENT SITES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES NETWORK CONNECTIVITY, REINFORCING THE HUMAN CONNECTION TO KEY FISH SOURCES AS A POTENTIAL RISK FACTOR FOR INFECTION.

NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN REDUCING INEQUALITIES, IMPROVING SOCIAL JUSTICE, ENHANCING BENEFITS, AND SHARING RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS PUBLIC HEALTH. DESPITE THIS, THE EXTANT LITERATURE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH (CEPH) HAS TOPIC-FOCUSED BOUNDARIES AND IS SCATTERED ACROSS DISCIPLINARY. LARGE-SCALE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY CURRENT STATUS, HOTSPOTS, KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE, DYNAMIC TRENDS, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS FIELD. METHODS: THE BIBLIOMETRIC TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATIONS ON CEPH IN WEB OF SCIENCE CORE COLLECTION FROM THOMSON REUTERS. ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWO PAPERS OUT OF 70.8 MILLION PUBLICATIONS OVER THE PERIOD OF 1980 TO 2020 AND THEIR 15,116 REFERENCES WERE RETRIEVED AS THE SAMPLE SET. FIRST, BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLICATIONS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTIONS OF GEOGRAPHY, JOURNALS AND CATEGORIES, PRODUCTIVE AUTHORS AND FREQUENTLY CITED ARTICLES, ETC. WERE OBTAINED. THEN, FOUR BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS, I.E. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, CO-CITATION ANALYSIS, CO-OCCURRENCE CLUSTERING, AND BURST DETECTION, WERE FURTHER CONDUCTED TO SKETCH THE CONTOURS OF THE STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF CEPH. RESULTS: BETWEEN JAN 1, 1980, AND APR 25, 2020, CEPH HAS ATTRACTED A SHARP INCREASE IN INTEREST ALL OVER THE WORLD. TOTAL 117 COUNTRIES OR REGIONS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE FIELD OF CEPH AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND INSTITUTIONALLY DISTINCT. THE UNITED STATES IS THE KEY REGION PERFORMING SUCH RESEARCH, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, BRAZIL AND CHINA ALSO CONTRIBUTED A LOT. THE ADVANCEMENTS OF CEPH ARE MARKED BY HISTORICALLY MOMENTOUS PUBLIC HEALTH EVENTS AND EVOLVED FROM MACROSCOPIC STRATEGIES TO MESOSCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC ACTIONS. BASED ON KEYWORD CLUSTERING AND CO-CITATION CLUSTERING, WE PROPOSE A 4O (I.E. ORIENTATION, OBJECT, OPERATION, AND OUTCOME) FRAMEWORK OF CEPH TO FACILITATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT GLOBAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND AN ELABORATE STRUCTURING OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FUTURE. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DRAWS AN OUTLINE OF THE GLOBAL REVIEW ON THE CONTEMPORARY AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH OF CEPH WHICH MIGHT PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE STOCK AND UNDERSTAND THE MARCH OF KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS THE LOGICAL VENATION UNDERLYING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO INFORM POLICY MAKING.","10.1186/s13690-021-00525-3","0778-7367","ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH",NA,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH A BIBLIOMETRIC MAPPING OF GLOBAL RESEARCH","79",2021,"ISI","Arch.

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, COMPOUND DISASTERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, ACCIDENT DISASTERS, AND NATURAL HAZARDS HAVE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY ALL OVER THE WORLD; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE COMPOUND DISASTER EMERGENCY COLLABORATION NETWORKS. THUS, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE 7 MARCH BUILDING COLLAPSE IN QUANZHOU CITY AS A CASE STUDY. THIS CASE WAS A TYPICAL COMPOUND DISASTER INVOLVING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND AN ACCIDENT DISASTER DURING COVID-19. BASED ON THE NETWORK ANALYSIS, THE OVERALL RESPONSE AND DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMERGENCY COLLABORATION FOR COMPOUND DISASTERS WERE EXAMINED IN THIS STUDY. A COMPOUND DISASTER EMERGENCY COLLABORATION NETWORK (ECN) WAS CONSTRUCTED BY IDENTIFYING THE INTERACTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMERGENCY ORGANIZATIONS. AFTER APPLYING TIME SLICES, THE DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF NETWORK STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATIONAL-FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS, ORGANIZATIONAL ATTRIBUTES, AND CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE DISCUSSED. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SHOWED THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE DENSITY AND CONNECTIVITY OF THE COMPOUND DISASTER ECN FIRST DECREASED BEFORE INCREASING. MEANWHILE, THE EVOLUTION OF THE NETWORK STRUCTURE FOLLOWED A PATH FROM DECENTRALIZED TO CONCENTRATED AND FROM BEING UNEVEN TO AN EQUILIBRIUM. (2) THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PRACTICES OF COMPOUND DISASTERS DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS INDICATED VARIED EMERGENCY NEEDS FOR EMERGENCY ORGANIZATIONS. WE FOUND THAT THE FORMATION OF EMERGENCY TASKS NOT ONLY INVOLVED THE PASSIVE ADAPTATION TO MATCH THE PRACTICE FOR COMPOUND DISASTERS, BUT ALSO THE ACTIVE CHOICES OF EMERGENCY ORGANIZATIONS WHEN FACING COMPOUND DISASTERS ACCORDING TO THEIR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES AND DECISIONS. (3) THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENTS, THE GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY RESCUE ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE THE CORE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE ECN. PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ECN TO IMPROVE THE DIVERSE AND HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES.

THE YEARLY AND MONTHLY NETWORKS WERE ANALYZED FOR INTER- AND INTRA-PROVINCIAL MOVEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 200,000 MOVEMENTS OCCURRED IN 2017, INVOLVING THE TRANSPORT OF 200 MILLION LIVE BROILERS FROM GUANGXI. ALTHOUGH GUANGXI EXPORTED TO 24 OUT OF 32 PROVINCES OF CHINA, 95\% OF INTER-PROVINCIAL MOVEMENTS OCCURRED WITH THREE BORDERING PROVINCES. WITHIN GUANGXI, COUNTIES WERE HIGHLY CONNECTED THROUGH THE LIVE BROILER MOVEMENTS, CREATING CONDITIONS FOR RAPID VIRUS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE. INTERESTINGLY, A PEAK IN MOVEMENTS DURING THE CHINESE LUNAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS, LATE JANUARY IN 2017, WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY, LIKELY DUE TO H7N9-RELATED CONTROL MEASURES CONSTRAINING LIVE BIRD TRADING.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROGRESSION OF COMORBIDITIES CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS TOWARDS THE PREVENTION AND BETTER MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES. ADMINISTRATIVE DATA CAN BE USED IN THIS REGARD AS THEY CONTAIN SEMANTIC INFORMATION ON PATIENTS' HEALTH CONDITIONS. MOST STUDIES IN THIS FIELD ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THE PROGRESSION OF ONE CHRONIC DISEASE RATHER THAN MULTIPLE DISEASES. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESSION OF TWO CHRONIC DISEASES IN THE AUSTRALIAN HEALTH CONTEXT. IT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON THE COMORBIDITY PROGRESSION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM), AS THE PREVALENCE OF THESE CHRONIC DISEASES IN AUSTRALIANS IS HIGH. A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED TO UNDERSTAND AND REPRESENT THE PROGRESSION OF CVD IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM USING GRAPH THEORY AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. TWO STUDY COHORTS (I.E., PATIENTS WITH BOTH T2DM AND CVD AND PATIENTS WITH ONLY T2DM) WERE SELECTED FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE DATASET OBTAINED FROM AN AUSTRALIAN HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY. TWO BASELINE DISEASE NETWORKS WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM THESE TWO SELECTED COHORTS. A FINAL DISEASE NETWORK FROM TWO BASELINE DISEASE NETWORKS WAS THEN GENERATED BY WEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS IN A NORMALIZED WAY. THE PREVALENCE OF RENAL FAILURE, FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE DISORDERS, HYPERTENSION AND OBESITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PATIENTS WITH BOTH CVD AND T2DM THAN PATIENTS WITH ONLY T2DM. THIS SHOWED THAT THESE CHRONIC DISEASES OCCURRED FREQUENTLY DURING THE PROGRESSION OF CVD IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM. THE PROPOSED NETWORK-BASED MODEL MAY POTENTIALLY HELP THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO UNDERSTAND HIGH-RISK DISEASES AND THE PROGRESSION PATTERNS BETWEEN THE RECURRENCE OF T2DM AND CVD.

SOME COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE MODELERS ANALYZE AGENT-BASED MODELS WHERE INDIVIDUALS DO HAVE SIMULATED COGNITION, BUT THEY OFTEN LACK THE STRENGTHS OF NETWORK SCIENCE, NAMELY IN EMPIRICALLY-DRIVEN NETWORK STRUCTURES. WE INTRODUCE A COGNITIVE CASCADE MODEL THAT COMBINES A NETWORK SCIENCE BELIEF CASCADE APPROACH WITH AN INTERNAL COGNITIVE MODEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGENTS AS IN OPINION DIFFUSION MODELS AS A PUBLIC OPINION DIFFUSION (POD) MODEL, ADDING MEDIA INSTITUTIONS AS AGENTS WHICH BEGIN OPINION CASCADES. WE SHOW THAT THE MODEL, EVEN WITH A VERY SIMPLISTIC BELIEF FUNCTION TO CAPTURE COGNITIVE EFFECTS CITED IN DISINFORMATION STUDY (DISSONANCE AND EXPOSURE), ADDS EXPRESSIVE POWER OVER EXISTING CASCADE MODELS. WE CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE COGNITIVE CASCADE MODEL WITH OUR SIMPLE COGNITIVE FUNCTION ACROSS VARIOUS GRAPH TOPOLOGIES AND INSTITUTIONAL MESSAGING PATTERNS. WE ARGUE FROM OUR RESULTS THAT POPULATION-LEVEL AGGREGATE OUTCOMES OF THE MODEL QUALITATIVELY MATCH WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN COVID-RELATED PUBLIC OPINION POLLS, AND THAT THE MODEL DYNAMICS LEND INSIGHTS AS TO HOW TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF PROBLEMATIC BELIEFS. THE OVERALL MODEL SETS UP A FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH SOCIAL SCIENCE MISINFORMATION RESEARCHERS AND COMPUTATIONAL OPINION DIFFUSION MODELERS CAN JOIN FORCES TO UNDERSTAND, AND HOPEFULLY LEARN HOW TO BEST COUNTER, THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION AND ``ALTERNATIVE FACTS.''","10.1371/journal.pone.0261811","1932-6203","PLOS ONE",NA,"COGNITIVE CASCADES HOW TO MODEL AND POTENTIALLY COUNTER THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS","17",2022,"ISI","PLOS ONE",0,"none",NA,NA,"RABB N, 2022, PLOS ONE","RABB N, 2022, PLOS ONE"

CONVERSELY, RATES OF COMMUNITY-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS HAVE NOT DECREASED BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUACY OF PUBLIC HEALTH MECHANISMS TO CONTROL TRANSMISSION IN A COMMUNITY SETTING. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO USE RISK-BASED INFORMATION FROM EMPIRICAL SOCIO-CULTURAL-BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF CARRIAGE AND TRANSMISSION TO INFORM INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THAT REDUCE S AUREUS TRANSMISSION IN THE COMMUNITY. BROAD DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BECAUSE OF CULTURAL AFFILIATION, TRAVEL, AND RESIDENCY PATTERNS MAY IMPACT S AUREUS CARRIAGE AND TRANSMISSION, EITHER AS RISK OR AS PROTECTIVE FACTORS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO (1) CHARACTERIZE S AUREUS CARRIAGE RATES AND COMPARE CIRCULATING PATHOGEN GENOTYPES WITH THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE ISOLATED FROM LOCAL CLINICAL SPECIMENS ACROSS RESIDENT GROUPS AND ACROSS HISPANIC AND NON-HISPANIC WHITE ETHNIC GROUPS AND (2) EVALUATE SOCIAL NETWORK RELATIONSHIPS AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH-BASED RISK FACTORS FOR THEIR IMPACT ON CARRIAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF S AUREUS. METHODS: WE COMBINE SOCIOCULTURAL SURVEY APPROACHES TO POPULATION HEALTH SAMPLING WITH S AUREUS CARRIAGE AND PATHOGEN GENOMIC ANALYSIS TO INFER TRANSMISSION PATTERNS. WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCES OF S AUREUS FROM COMMUNITY AND CLINICAL SAMPLING WILL BE PHYLOGENETICALLY COMPARED TO DETERMINE IF STRAINS THAT CAUSE DISEASE (CLINICAL SAMPLES) ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF COMMUNITY GENOTYPES. PHYLOGENETIC COMPARISONS OF STRAINS COLLECTED FROM PARTICIPANTS WITHIN SOCIAL GROUPS CAN INDICATE POSSIBLE TRANSMISSION WITHIN THE GROUP. WE CAN THEREFORE COMBINE TRANSMISSION DATA WITH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH VARIABLES (SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, HEALTH HISTORY, ETC) AND SOCIAL NETWORK VARIABLES (BOTH EGOCENTRIC AND RELATIONAL) TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH S AUREUS TRANSMISSION. RESULTS: WE CONDUCTED A FIRST YEAR PILOT TEST AND FEASIBILITY TEST OF SURVEY AND BIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYTIC PROCEDURES BASED ON THE ORIGINAL FUNDED DESIGN FOR THIS PROJECT (\#NIH U54MD012388). THAT DESIGN RESULTED IN SURVEY DATA COLLECTION FROM 336 GROUPS AND 1337 INDIVIDUALS. THE PROTOCOL, DESCRIBED BELOW, IS A REVISION BASED ON DATA ASSESSMENT, NEW FINDINGS FOR STATISTICAL POWER ANALYSES, AND REFINED DATA MONITORING PROCEDURES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE ETHNIC-SPECIFIC PREVALENCE OF S AUREUS CARRIAGE IN A US BORDER COMMUNITY. THE STUDY WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH KIN AND NONKIN SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONCORDANT WITH CARRIAGE PREVALENCE IN SOCIAL GROUPS. GENETIC ANALYSIS OF S AUREUS STRAINS WILL FURTHER DISTINGUISH PUTATIVE TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS ACROSS SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP CONTEXTS AND INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE OF S AUREUS RESERVOIRS ACROSS CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS.

SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA WAS USED TO SUPPORT THE WGS DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, 140 MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS ISOLATES FROM 135 CASES WERE SEQUENCED. FOUR CLUSTERS WERE IDENTIFIED, ALL FROM EURO-AMERICAN LINEAGE. ONE CLUSTER REPRESENTED 62\% OF ALL CASES THAT WERE SEQUENCED OVER THE ENTIRE STUDY PERIOD. IN THIS CLUSTER, 2 LARGE CHAINS OF TRANSMISSION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 3 SUPERSPREADING EVENTS IN A HOMELESS SHELTER. ONE OF THE SUPERSPREADING EVENTS WAS LINKED TO A NONSANCTIONED GAMBLING HOUSE THAT RESULTED IN FURTHER TRANSMISSION. SHELTER TO NONSHELTER TRANSMISSION WAS ALSO CONFIRMED. AN ALGORITHM DEVELOPED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF TRANSMISSION EVENTS DEMONSTRATED VERY GOOD REPRODUCIBILITY (KAPPA SCORE .98, 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, .97-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, NAMELY RESIDING IN A HOMELESS SHELTER AND SPENDING TIME IN A GAMBLING HOUSE, COMBINED WITH THE SUPERSPREADING EVENT EFFECT MAY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT FACTORS EXPLAINING THE RISE IN CASES IN THIS PREDOMINANTLY INUIT ARCTIC COMMUNITY.","10.1093/cid/ciaa420","1058-4838","CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES","2187-2195","MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF IMYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSISI TO DESCRIBE THE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS AMONG INUIT RESIDING IN IQALUIT NUNAVUT USING WHOLEGENOME SEQUENCING","72",2021,"ISI","Clin.

THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY (CARICOM), CHILDREN ARE CONSUMING UNHEALTHY DIETS, CHARACTERIZED BY ENERGY-DENSE, PROCESSED AND ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS, SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES, AND LIMITED QUANTITIES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. COMMUNITY-BASED SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMMES (SMPS) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS USEFUL VEHICLES TO ADDRESS UNHEALTHY EATING AMONG CHILDREN, AND ``FARM-TO-SCHOOL'' APPROACHES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF LOCALLY GROWN NUTRITIOUS PRODUCE, WHILE SUPPORTING LOCAL AGRICULTURE AND REDUCING THE REGION'S RELIANCE ON FOOD IMPORTS. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS TO ENHANCING COMMUNITY-BASED SCHOOL FEEDING VALUE-CHAINS IN THE CARICOM, BY FOCUSING ON THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF NEVIS WHERE THERE IS AN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING FARM-TO-SCHOOL VALUE CHAINS. USING KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS COMBINED WITH FOCUS GROUPS WITH ACTORS ALONG THE LOCAL FOOD VALUE CHAIN, WE IDENTIFY THE FOLLOWING BARRIERS TO AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY-BASED SMP: A LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND AN ABSENCE OF CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL FARMERS AND THE SMP ADMINISTRATION; GENERALLY LOW LEVELS OF CHILD ACCEPTANCE OF SCHOOL MEALS CONTAINING FRESH VEGETABLES; AND LIMITED INTERSECTORAL COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION AMONG SMP STAKEHOLDERS AND LOCAL FARMERS. USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE FURTHER DISCUSS LIMITATIONS IN GROUP ORGANIZATION AND COORDINATION AMONG LOCAL FARMERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMP IMPROVEMENT.

TO DATE, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE ON HOW AND WHY SUCH NETWORKS EMERGE. THEREFORE, THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE (A) TO ANALYZE THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES AND (B) TO IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONS OF COOPERATION IN INTERORGANIZATIONAL COMMUNITY NETWORKS OF SPORT AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROMOTION. METHODS: SURVEY DATA ON COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND ORGANIZATIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF SPORTS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROVIDERS AS WELL AS SPORTS ADMINISTRATING ORGANIZATIONS IN TWO COMMUNITY NETWORKS LOCATED IN URBAN DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN GERMANY WERE COLLECTED (NETWORK I: N = 133 ORGANIZATIONS; NETWORK II: N = 50 ORGANIZATIONS). TWO QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE PROCEDURES - NETWORK ANALYSIS AND STOCHASTIC ANALYSES OF NETWORK MODELING (EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPHS) - WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: SIMILAR STRUCTURES AND CONDITIONS OF COOPERATION WERE FOUND IN THE NETWORKS (E.G. LOW DENSITY, CENTRALIZATION). THE COMMUNITY SPORTS ADMINISTRATIONS HAD THE MOST CENTRAL POSITIONS IN BOTH NETWORKS. EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH MODELING SHOWED THAT COOPERATION TOOK PLACE MORE FREQUENTLY IN TRIANGULAR STRUCTURES (CLOSURE EFFECT) AND REVOLVED AROUND A FEW CENTRAL ACTORS (PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT EFFECT).

WE EVALUATED THESE COLLABORATIONS BY STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CO-AUTHORS FROM THE PRCS AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES THAT PUBLISHED AT LEAST 1 ARTICLE TOGETHER IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM. METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED ALL THE AUTHORS OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BY PRCS AND COLLABORATING MEMBERS IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 2015 AND CONSTRUCTED A NETWORK SHOWING THE LINKS BETWEEN AND AMONG ALL THE AUTHORS. WE CHARACTERIZED THE NETWORK WITH 4 MEASURES OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE (NETWORK COMPONENTS, NETWORK DENSITY, AVERAGE CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT, AVERAGE DISTANCE) AND 3 MEASURES OF INDIVIDUAL AUTHOR PERFORMANCES (DEGREE-, BETWEENNESS-, AND CLOSENESS-CENTRALITY). RESULTS: THE 413 ARTICLES HAD 1804 INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS AND 7995 CO-AUTHORSHIP RELATIONSHIPS (LINKS) IN 212 PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS.

WE EXAMINED PATTERNS OF TRANSMISSION OF CRE ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK CLUSTERING AND POSITIONS DURING PATIENT INTERFACILITY TRANSFER. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE GREATER HOUSTON REGION OFTEXAS, , AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY CONSTRUCTING FACILITY-TO-FACILITY PATIENT TRANSFER NETWORK USING CRE SURVEILLANCE DATA. THE NETWORK METHOD (COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHM) WAS USED TO DETECT CLUSTERING PATTERNS OF CRE IN THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, NETWORK MEASURES OF CENTRALITY AND LOCAL CONNECTIVITY (CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT) WERE COMPUTED FOR EACH HEALTHCARE FACILITY. ZERO-INFLATED NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO TEST THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NETWORK MEASURES AND FACILITY-SPECIFIC INCIDENCE RATE OF CRE. RESULTS: A NETWORK OF 268 HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WAS IDENTIFIED, IN WHICH 10 ACUTE-CARE HOSPITALS (ACHS) ALONE ACCOUNTED FOR 63\% OF IDENTIFIED CRE CASES.

HOWEVER, MANY NETWORKS DERIVED FROM MODERN DATASETS ARE NOT JUST LARGE, BUT DENSE, WITH A HIGH RATIO OF EDGES TO NODES. THIS INCLUDES HUMAN MOBILITY NETWORKS WHERE MOST LOCATIONS HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF LINKS TO MANY OTHER LOCATIONS. SIMULATING LARGE-SCALE EPIDEMICS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AND IN MANY CASES IS PRACTICALLY INFEASIBLE. ONE WAY TO REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL COST OF SIMULATING EPIDEMICS ON THESE NETWORKS IS SPARSIFICATION, WHERE A REPRESENTATIVE SUBSET OF EDGES IS SELECTED BASED ON SOME MEASURE OF THEIR IMPORTANCE. WE TEST SEVERAL SPARSIFICATION STRATEGIES, RANGING FROM NAIVE THRESHOLDING TO RANDOM SAMPLING OF EDGES, ON MOBILITY DATA FROM THE U.S. FOLLOWING RECENT WORK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, WE FIND THAT THE MOST ACCURATE APPROACH USES THE EFFECTIVE RESISTANCES OF EDGES, WHICH PRIORITIZES EDGES THAT ARE THE ONLY EFFICIENT WAY TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THEIR ENDPOINTS. THE RESULTING SPARSE NETWORK PRESERVES MANY ASPECTS OF THE BEHAVIOR OF AN SIR MODEL, INCLUDING BOTH GLOBAL QUANTITIES, LIKE THE EPIDEMIC SIZE, AND LOCAL DETAILS OF STOCHASTIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE PROBABILITY EACH NODE BECOMES INFECTED AND ITS DISTRIBUTION OF ARRIVAL TIMES. THIS HOLDS EVEN WHEN THE SPARSE NETWORK PRESERVES FEWER THAN 10\% OF THE EDGES OF THE ORIGINAL NETWORK. IN ADDITION TO ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY, THIS METHOD HELPS ILLUMINATE WHICH LINKS OF A WEIGHTED, UNDIRECTED NETWORK ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO DISEASE SPREAD. AUTHOR SUMMARY EPIDEMIOLOGISTS INCREASINGLY USE SOCIAL NETWORKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW GEOGRAPHY, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND HUMAN MOBILITY AFFECT DISEASE SPREAD AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. WHILE HIGHLY DETAILED DATA ON HUMAN SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE NOW AVAILABLE, THE SIZE AND DENSITY OF THESE MODERN NETWORKS MAKES THEM COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE TO STUDY. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, WE STUDY METHODS FOR REDUCING A NETWORK TO ITS MOST IMPORTANT LINKS. FOLLOWING RECENT WORK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, WE USE THE EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE, WHICH TAKES BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY INTO ACCOUNT. WE TEST THIS METHOD IN SIMULATIONS ON A U.S.-WIDE MOBILITY NETWORK AND FIND THAT IT PRESERVES EPIDEMIC DYNAMICS WITH HIGH FIDELITY.

SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) CAN BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE CATTLE TRADE PATTERNS AND TO IDENTIFY HIGHLY CONNECTED PREMISES THAT MAY ACT AS HUBS IN THE MOVEMENT NETWORK, WHICH COULD BE SUBJECTED TO TARGETED CONTROL MEASURES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES SUCH AS BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS (TB). HERE, WE ANALYZED DATA ON CATTLE MOVEMENT AND SLAUGHTERHOUSE SURVEILLANCE FOR DETECTION OF TB-LIKE LESIONS (TLL) OVER THE 2016-2018 PERIOD IN THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL (RS) IN BRAZIL WITH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (I) TO CHARACTERIZE CATTLE TRADE DESCRIBING THE STATIC FULL, YEARLY, AND MONTHLY SNAPSHOTS OF THE NETWORK CONTACT TRADE, (II) TO IDENTIFY CLUSTERS IN THE SPACE AND CONTACT NETWORKS OF PREMISES FROM WHICH ANIMALS WITH TLL ORIGINATED, AND (III) TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF TARGETED CONTROL ACTIONS TO DECREASE TB SPREAD IN THE CATTLE POPULATION OF RS USING A STOCHASTIC METAPOPULATION DISEASE TRANSMISSION MODEL THAT SIMULATED WITHIN-FARM AND BETWEEN-FARM DISEASE SPREAD. WE FOUND HETEROGENEOUS DENSITIES OF PREMISES AND ANIMALS IN THE STUDY AREA. THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTACT NETWORK REVEALED A HIGHLY CONNECTED (SIMILAR TO 94\%) TRADE NETWORK, WITH STRONG TEMPORAL TRENDS, ESPECIALLY FOR MAY AND NOVEMBER. THE TLL CASES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CLUSTERED IN SPACE AND IN THE CONTACT NETWORK, SUGGESTING THE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH LOCAL (E.G., FENCE-TO-FENCE) AND MOVEMENT-MEDIATED TB TRANSMISSION. ACCORDING TO THE DISEASE SPREAD MODEL, REMOVING THE TOP 7\% CONNECTED FARMS BASED ON DEGREE AND BETWEENNESS COULD REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INFECTED FARMS OVER THREE YEARS BY >50\%.

THE AUTHORS EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATIONS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND PER-CEIVED LONELINESS WITH COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE BRAZILIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGING. METHODS: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS, SOCIAL ISOLATION WAS EVALUATED BY A COMPOSITE SCORE INCLUDING MARITAL STATUS, SOCIAL CONTACT, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS GLOBAL COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, WHICH CONSIDERED MEMORY, VERBAL FLUENCY, AND TEMPORAL ORIENTATION TESTS. LIN-EAR AND LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS WERE ADJUSTED FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS ADDED INTERACTION TERMS OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS TO EXAMINE WHETHER DEPRESSION, MEASURED THROUGH THE CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES-DEPRESSION SCALE, MODIFIED THESE ASSOCIATIONS. RESULTS: AMONG 6,986 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE = 62.1 </N> 9.2 YEARS), HIGHER LEVELS OF SOCIAL CONNECTIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER GLOBAL COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). PERCEIVED LONELINESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE COGNITION (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). INTERAC-TIONS OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH SOCIAL CONNECTIONS SCORES WERE FOUND ON MEMORY Z-SCORE AND WITH LONELINESS ON GLOBAL AND MEMORY Z-SCORES, SUGGESTING A WEAKER ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL ISOLATION OR LONELINESS AND COGNITION AMONG THOSE WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.

METHODS: DATA FROM THE MEXICAN HEALTH AND AGING STUDY (MAIN DATA 2012, MORTALITY 2015) WAS USED. FRAILTY WAS OPERATIONALIZED WITH A 35-DEFICIT FRAILTY INDEX (FI). ANALYZED NODES WERE THE DEFICITS PLUS DEATH. THE EDGES, LINKING THOSE NODES WERE OBTAINED THROUGH STRUCTURAL LEARNING, AND AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH ASSOCIATED WITH A DISCRETE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODEL (MARKOV NETWORK) WAS DERIVED. TWO ALGORITHMS, HILL-CLIMBING (HC) AND PETER AND CLARK (PC), WERE USED TO DERIVE THE GRAPH STRUCTURE. ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION AND TERTILES OF THE TOTAL FI SCORE. RESULTS: FROM THE TOTAL SAMPLE OF 10,983 ADULTS AGED 50 OR OLDER, 43.8\% WERE WOMEN, AND THE MEAN AGE WAS 64.6 YEARS (SD = 9.3).

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO REVEAL BOTH THE SHARED AND DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS OF 2 POPULAR OHCS IN CHINA BY SYSTEMATICALLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY ANALYZING THEIR UGC AND THE ASSOCIATED USER BEHAVIORS. METHODS: WE CONCENTRATED ON STUDYING THE LUNG CANCER FORUM (LCF) AND BREAST CANCER FORUM (BCF) ON MIJIAN, AND THE DIABETES CONSULTATION FORUM (DCF) ON SWEET HOME, BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 3 DISEASES AMONG CHINESE PATIENTS AND THEIR PREVALENCE ON CHINESE OHCS IN GENERAL.

IN ADDITION TO ANIMAL MOVEMENTS, MANY PATHOGENS CAN SPREAD BETWEEN FARMS VIA MECHANISMS MEDIATED BY SPATIAL PROXIMITY. HETEROGENEITIES IN CONTACT PATTERNS BASED ON SPATIAL PROXIMITY ARE LESS COMMONLY CONSIDERED IN NETWORK STUDIES, AND STUDIES THAT JOINTLY CONSIDER SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY AND ANIMAL MOVEMENT ARE RARE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MOVEMENT VERSUS SPATIAL PROXIMITY NETWORKS DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT ENDEMIC VIRUS, PORCINE REPRODUCTIVE AND RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VIRUS (PRRSV), WITHIN A SWINE-DENSE REGION OF THE U.S. PRRSV CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO NUMEROUS PHYLOGENETIC LINEAGES. SUCH DATA CAN BE USED TO BETTER RESOLVE BETWEEN-FARM INFECTION CHAINS AND ELUCIDATE TYPES OF CONTACT MOST ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSMISSION. HERE, WE CONSTRUCT MOVEMENT AND SPATIAL PROXIMITY NETWORKS; FARMS WITHIN THE NETWORKS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASES IF A GIVEN PRRSV LINEAGE HAD BEEN RECOVERED AT LEAST ONCE IN A YEAR FOR EACH OF THREE YEARS ANALYZED. WE EVALUATED SIX LINEAGES AND SUB-LINEAGES ACROSS THREE YEARS, AND EVALUATED THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE OF EACH NETWORK BY APPLYING NETWORK K-TESTS TO STATISTICALLY EVALUATE WHETHER THE PATTERN OF CASE OCCURRENCE WITHIN THE NETWORK WAS CONSISTENT WITH TRANSMISSION VIA NETWORK LINKAGES. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT ANIMAL MOVEMENTS, NOT LOCAL AREA SPREAD, PLAY A DOMINANT ROLE IN SHAPING TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS, THOUGH THERE WERE DIFFERENCES AMONGST LINEAGES. THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF CASE FARMS INTER-LINKED VIA ANIMAL MOVEMENTS WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.1X HIGHER THAN RANDOM EXPECTATIONS (RANGE: 1.7-13.7; P < 0.05, NETWORK K-TEST), WHEREAS THIS MEASURE WAS ONLY 2.7X HIGHER THAN RANDOM EXPECTATIONS FOR FARMS LINKED VIA SPATIAL PROXIMITY (RANGE: 1.3-5.4; P < 0.05, NETWORK K-TEST). FOR SPATIAL PROXIMITY NETWORKS, CONTACT BASED ON PROXIMITIES OF < 5 KM APPEARED TO HAVE GREATER EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE THAN LONGER DISTANCES, LIKELY RELATED TO DIMINISHING PROBABILITIES OF LOCAL AREA SPREAD AT GREATER DISTANCES. HOWEVER, THE GREATER OVERALL LEVELS OF CONNECTIVITY OF THE SPATIAL NETWORK COMPARED TO THE MOVEMENT NETWORK HIGHLIGHTS THE VULNERABILITY OF PIG POPULATIONS TO WIDE-SPREAD TRANSMISSION VIA THIS ROUTE. BY COMBINING GENETIC DATA WITH NETWORK ANALYSIS, THIS RESEARCH ADVANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DYNAMICS OF BETWEEN-FARM SPREAD OF PRRSV, HELPS ESTABLISH THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSMISSION VIA ANIMAL MOVEMENTS VERSUS LOCAL AREA SPREAD, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL FOR TARGETED CONTROL STRATEGIES BASED UPON HETEROGENEITIES IN NETWORK CONNECTIVITY.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104977","0167-5877","PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE",NA,"CONTRASTING ANIMAL MOVEMENT AND SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS IN SHAPING TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS OF A GENETICALLY DIVERSE VIRUS","178",2020,"ISI","Prev.

GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS COULD HELP INFORM HEALTHY WEIGHT PROMOTING INTERVENTIONS. WE CONDUCTED A FEASIBILITY STUDY AMONG YOUTH AT RISK OF OBESITY TO DOCUMENT PROCESS OUTCOMES, TO DISCERN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PSN FEATURES AND WEIGHT-RELATED BEHAVIORS, AND TO GENERATE HYPOTHESES WITH RESPECT TO PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT (SS) AND SEX. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (EGOS) NOMINATED UP TO 10 PEOPLE (ALTERS) WITH WHOM THEY DISCUSSED IMPORTANT MATTERS. EGOS REPORTED THEIR OWN AND EACH ALTER'S AGE, SEX, BODY SHAPE, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS, RELATION, FREQUENCY OF EXERCISING WITH EACH ALTER, AND OF BEING ENCOURAGED BY EACH ALTER TO EXERCISE. WE EXAMINED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PSN FEATURES AND WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES AND EXPLORED THE ROLE OF SS, USING BOTH CORRELATIONAL AND LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES. RESULTS: THERE WERE 45 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE 16.4 YEARS) AND BODY MASS INDEX Z-SCORE (ZBMI) RANGED FROM -1.2 TO 3.9. THERE WERE FEW MISSING RESPONSES TO PSN ITEMS; BROAD VARIATION ACROSS MOST ITEMS, INCLUDING SS SCORES, WAS REPORTED. CORRELATIONS POINTED TO PLAUSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS IMPLICATING PSN FEATURES AND LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS. IN EXPLORATORY ANALYSES, NETWORK-BASED SS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ADIPOSITY IN GIRLS AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED IN BOYS, WHILE LIFESTYLE ROLE MODELLING WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ADIPOSITY.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND OBESITY-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS AMONG ADULT SOMALI IMMIGRANTS IN A MINNESOTA CITY IN ORDER TO INFORM A COMMUNITY-BASED, PARTICIPATORY, RESEARCH-DERIVED, SOCIAL NETWORK INTERVENTION TO DECREASE OBESITY RATES. METHODS: SURVEY DATA (DEMOGRAPHICS, GENERAL HEALTH MEASURES, AND SOCIOBEHAVIORAL AND NETWORK MEASURES) AND HEIGHT AND WEIGHT MEASURES (FOR CALCULATING BODY MASS INDEX) WERE COLLECTED FROM ADULT SOMALI IMMIGRANTS BY BILINGUAL STUDY TEAM MEMBERS AT COMMUNITY LOCATIONS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO REPORT THE SURVEY AND BIOMETRIC DATA. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO DESCRIBE THE BASIC ASSOCIATIONS OF PARTICIPANTS AND NETWORK FACTORS. NETWORK DATA WERE ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY NODES AND TIES, TO VISUALIZE THE NETWORK, AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONISTS FOR A FUTURE SOCIAL NETWORK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: OF THE 646 PARTICIPANTS, 50% WERE OVERWEIGHT OR AFFECTED BY OBESITY. THE NETWORK HAD 1703 NODES WITH 3583 TIES BETWEEN NODES, AND MODULARITY WAS HIGH (0.75). COMPARED WITH RESPONDENTS OF NORMAL WEIGHT, PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE OVERWEIGHT OR AFFECTED BY OBESITY HAD MORE NETWORK MEMBERS WHO WERE ALSO OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE (ODDS RATIO [OR], 2.90; 95% CI, 1.11-7.56; P = .03); THIS WAS MOST NOTABLE FOR MEN (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 1.22-17.22; P = .02) AND SUGGESTIVE FOR THOSE 50 YEARS OR OLDER (OR, 24.23; 95% CI, 1.55-377.83; P = .03).

THE DATA OBTAINED FROM NODEXL PRO WERE CLEANED. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TOOLS WERE USED TO ANALYSE AND VISUALISE OUR DATA. USING THIS METHOD, SENTIMENT-RELATED WORDS (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WORDS), THE TOP (THE MOST MENTIONED) 10 HASHTAGS, TOP WORDS AND TOP WORD PAIRS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE PATTERNS OF WORD PAIRS COMMUNICATED IN OUR NETWORK WERE VISUALISED BASED ON EACH WORD PAIR'S FREQUENCY. THIS ALSO ENABLED US TO CARRY OUT A CONTENT ANALYSIS TO CREATE CODING OF THE WORD PAIRS' DATA. A TOTAL OF 81 249 TWEETS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT CONTAINED THE TERMS 'FOOD' AND 'POVERTY'. OUR FINDINGS REVEALED THAT INDIVIDUALS' TWEETS OVERWHELMINGLY CONTAINED VIEWS ABOUT THE INCREASE IN HUNGER, FOOD POVERTY AND FOOD INSECURITY DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. TWITTER USERS PERCEIVED THAT WHEN THE PANDEMIC MEASURES BEGAN, MANY FOOD-SECURE FAMILIES WERE PUSHED INTO FOOD INSECURITY DUE TO A RAPID RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND RISING POVERTY DUE TO THE QUARANTINE AND STAY-AT-HOME INSTRUCTIONS IN PLACE AT THE TIME. THEY ALSO ADDRESSED THE SHARP RISE IN FOOD POVERTY BEING DRIVEN BY PANIC BUYING, FOOD SHORTAGES, FOOD AFFORDABILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN FOOD SUPPLY AND FOOD SYSTEMS.

THE MALE PREDOMINANCE IN THE CARRIAGE IS DETERMINED BY SEX-SPECIFIC PREDISPOSING HOST CHARACTERISTICS AS THE SOCIAL TRANSMISSION IS LESS FREQUENT IN MALES THAN FEMALES. INFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKS MAY ADD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF S. AUREUS EPIDEMIOLOGY.","S1201-9712(22)00488-X","1878-3511 (ELECTRONIC) 1201-9712 (LINKING)","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES : IJID : OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES","200-209","SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS CARRIAGE IN A GENERAL YOUTH POPULATION","123",2022,"ISI","INT J INFECT DIS",0,"none","DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY MEDICINE, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019 TROMSØ, NORWAY; DIVISION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: DINA.;B.;STENSEN@UIT.;NO.; DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION CONTROL, DIVISION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND AGEING, NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, 0473 OSLO, NORWAY; DEPARTMENT OF PAIN MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH, DIVISION OF EMERGENCIES AND CRITICAL CARE, OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, 0424 OSLO, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL BIOLOGY, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019 TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL BIOLOGY, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019 TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION CONTROL, DIVISION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL BIOLOGY, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019 TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY.; DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION CONTROL, DIVISION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY, 9019, TROMSØ, NORWAY; FACULTY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, MOLDE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, 6410 MOLDE, NORWAY.;","UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY;ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: DINA.;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY;NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH;OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UIT THE ARCTIC UNIVERSITY OF NORWAY;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF NORTH NORWAY;MOLDE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE","STENSEN DB, 2022, INT J INFECT DIS","STENSEN DB, 2022, INT J INFECT DIS"

RECENT FINDINGS: MOST ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN 2019 USED REGRESSION ANALYSES, AND FEWER USED HIGHER LEVEL MODELING TECHNIQUES, FREQUENCIES AND DESCRIPTIVE, LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY, AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. SOME EMPLOYED ETHNOGRAPHY, QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, OR WERE SIMPLY REVIEWS. MOST SYNDEMIC CO-FACTORS WERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE, RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, DEPRESSION, INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE, STIGMA, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, AND TRAUMA AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.

GIVEN THE SALIENCE OF PEER RELATIONSHIPS DURING ADOLESCENCE, AND RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS NEGATIVELY IMPACT SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, THIS STUDY USES NOVEL METHODOLOGY FROM SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNCOVER THE SOCIAL PROCESSES LINKING DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS AND ANXIETY DISORDERS WITH ADOLESCENT FRIENDSHIPS. IN PARTICULAR, THE STUDY FOCUSES ON PEER WITHDRAWAL, PEER POPULARITY, AND PEER HOMOPHILY IN RELATION TO BOTH DISORDERS. METHODS: DATA COME FROM 15-YEAR OLD STUDENTS IN FOUR SCOTTISH SECONDARY SCHOOLS (N = 602). DIAGNOSES OF DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS AND ANXIETY DISORDERS WERE PRODUCED USING THE DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN, AND PEER RELATIONSHIP DATA WERE OBTAINED THROUGH A FRIENDSHIP NOMINATION SURVEY. EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF PEER WITHDRAWAL, PEER POPULARITY, AND PEER HOMOPHILY BASED ON EACH DISORDER. RESULTS: RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT ADOLESCENTS WITH DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS WERE MORE POPULAR THAN THEIR PEERS WITHOUT DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). FRIENDSHIP WAS ALSO MORE LIKELY BETWEEN TWO ADOLESCENTS BOTH WITH OR BOTH WITHOUT DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), DEMONSTRATING PEER HOMOPHILY. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANXIETY DISORDERS WERE RELATED TO ADOLESCENT PEER RELATIONSHIPS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS MAY BE SOCIALLY REWARDED (E.G., PEER POPULARITY) AND SOCIALLY CLUSTERED (E.G., HOMOPHILY), WHEREAS ANXIETY DISORDERS SHOW NO SUCH TRENDS. THUS, INTERVENTION EFFORTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE PEER SOCIAL STATUS THAT MAY BE GAINED FROM ENGAGING IN DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DURING THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD. FURTHER, GIVEN THAT SIMILARITY IN DBD STATUS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF FRIENDSHIP, ADOLESCENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE SURROUNDED BY PEERS WHO REINFORCE THEIR BEHAVIORS.","S0277-9536(20)30192-1","1873-5347 (ELECTRONIC) 0277-9536 (PRINT) 0277-9536 (LINKING)","SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE (1982)","112973","MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND ADOLESCENT PEER RELATIONSHIPS","253",2020,"ISI","SOC SCI MED",0,"none","UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES, MRC/CSO SOCIAL & PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIT, 200 RENFIELD STREET, GLASGOW, G2 3AX, UNITED KINGDOM.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: EMILY.;LONG@GLASGOW.;AC.;UK.; UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, 62 HILLHEAD STREET, GLASGOW, G12 8QB, UNITED KINGDOM.; UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, MRC/CSO SOCIAL & PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIT, 200 RENFIELD STREET, GLASGOW, G2 3AX, UNITED KINGDOM.; UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, MRC/CSO SOCIAL & PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIT, 200 RENFIELD STREET, GLASGOW, G2 3AX, UNITED KINGDOM.; UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES, ADAM SMITH BUILDING, BUTE GARDENS, GLASGOW, G12 8RT, UNITED KINGDOM.; UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, MRC/CSO SOCIAL & PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIT, 200 RENFIELD STREET, GLASGOW, G2 3AX, UNITED KINGDOM.;","UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: EMILY.;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW","LONG E, 2020, SOC SCI MED","LONG E, 2020, SOC SCI MED"

OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND #BTSM'S ROLE AS A PATIENT SUPPORT SYSTEM, WE DESCRIBE USER DESCRIPTORS, GROWTH, INTERACTION, AND CONTENT SHARING. METHODS: WE ANALYZED ALL TWEETS CONTAINING #BTSM FROM 2012 TO 2018 USING THE SYMPLUR SIGNALS PLATFORM TO OBTAIN DATA AND TO DESCRIBE SYMPLUR-DEFINED USER CATEGORIES, TWEET CONTENT, AND TRENDS IN USE OVER TIME. WE CREATED A NETWORK PLOT WITH ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RETWEETS INVOLVING #BTSM IN 2018 TO VISUALIZE KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS TO OTHER USERS. RESULTS: FROM 2012 TO 2018, 59,764 UNIQUE USERS PARTICIPATED IN #BTSM, AMASSING 298,904 TWEETS. THE YEARLY VOLUME OF #BTSM TWEETS INCREASED BY 264.57% FROM 16,394 IN 2012 TO 43,373 IN 2018 WITH #BTSM CONSTANTLY TRENDING IN THE TOP 15 LIST OF DISEASE HASHTAGS, AS WELL THE TOP 15 LIST OF TWEET CHATS.

AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIVESTOCK MOVEMENT PATTERNS IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND NATIONAL TRANSMISSION RISKS OF HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASES DURING EPIDEMICS. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) IS AN APPROACH THAT HELPS TO DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. WE USED SNA TO DESCRIBE THE CONTACT STRUCTURE OF LIVESTOCK MOVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CONTIGUOUS U.S. FROM APRIL 1(ST), 2015 TO MARCH 31(ST), 2016. WE DESCRIBE 4 NETWORK TYPES: BEEF CATTLE, DAIRY CATTLE, SWINE, AND SMALL RUMINANT. LIVESTOCK MOVEMENT DATA WERE SOURCED FROM INTERSTATE CERTIFICATES OF VETERINARY INSPECTION (ICVI) WHILE COUNTY-LEVEL FARM DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE FROM THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE (NASS). IN THE DESCRIBED NETWORKS, NODES ARE REPRESENTED BY COUNTIES AND ARCS BY SHIPMENTS BETWEEN NODES; THE NETWORKS WERE WEIGHTED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS BETWEEN NODES. FOR THE ANALYSES, MOVEMENT DATA WERE AGGREGATED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. MEASURES OF CENTRALITY AND COHESIVENESS WERE COMPUTED AND IDENTIFICATION OF TRADE-COMMUNITIES IN ALL NETWORKS WAS CONDUCTED. DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, A TOTAL OF 219,042 MOVEMENTS WERE RECORDED AND BEEF CATTLE MOVEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR 63 % OF ALL MOVEMENTS. AT LEAST 70 % OF U.S. COUNTIES WERE PRESENT IN EACH OF THE NETWORKS, BUT THE DENSITY OF ARCS WAS LESS THAN 2% IN ALL NETWORKS. IN THE BEEF CATTLE NETWORK, COUNTIES WITH HIGH OUT-DEGREE WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED (0.8) WITH THE NUMBER OF BEEF COWS PER COUNTY WHILE FOR THE DAIRY CATTLE NETWORK A STRONG CORRELATION (>0.86) WAS FOUND WITH THE NUMBER OF DAIRY CATTLE PER KM(2) AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. ALL NETWORKS WERE FOUND TO HAVE BETWEEN 4 AND 6 LARGE COMMUNITIES (50 COUNTIES OR MORE PER COMMUNITY), AND WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLUSTERED EXCEPT FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN THE SMALL RUMINANT NETWORK. OUTPUTS REPORTED IN THESE ANALYSES CAN HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONTACT NETWORKS FOR BEEF CATTLE, DAIRY CATTLE, SWINE, AND SMALL RUMINANTS.

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SEVERE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED), MAY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE WHEN AN AGGRESSION IS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF VIOLENCE. THIS STUDY APPLIES SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) TO ED DATA IN THE LAZIO REGION WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF DIAGNOSES, WITHIN ALL THE ED ACCESSES OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING AN AGGRESSION, THAT ARE SIGNALS FOR GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. WE AIM TO DEVELOP A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR ED PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER TO STRENGTH THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. METHODS: A COHORT OF 124,691 WOMEN AGED 15-70 WITH AN ED VISIT FOR AGGRESSION BETWEEN 2003 AND 2015 WAS SELECTED AND, FOR EACH WOMAN, THE ED HISTORY OF DIAGNOSES AND TRAUMAS WAS RECONSTRUCTED. SNA WAS APPLIED ON ALL THESE DIAGNOSES AND TRAUMAS, INCLUDING ALSO 9 SPECIFIC VIOLENCE DIAGNOSES. SNA COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS AND NETWORK CENTRALITY MEASURES WERE USED TO DETECT DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS MORE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED TO VIOLENCE. A LOGISTIC MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO VALIDATE THE CAPABILITY OF THESE PATTERNS TO PREDICT THE ODDS FOR A WOMAN OF HAVING AN HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. MODEL RESULTS WERE SUMMED UP INTO A RISK CHART. RESULTS: AMONG WOMEN EXPERIENCING AN AGGRESSION, SNA IDENTIFIED FOUR COMMUNITIES REPRESENTING SPECIFIC VIOLENCE-RELATED PATTERNS OF DIAGNOSES. DIAGNOSES HAVING A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE VIOLENCE NETWORK WERE ALCOHOL OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE, PREGNANCY-RELATED CONDITIONS AND PSYCHOSES. THESE HIGH-RISK VIOLENCE RELATED PATTERNS ACCOUNTED FOR AT MOST 20% OF OUR COHORT. THE LOGISTIC MODEL HAD GOOD PREDICTIVE ACCURACY AND PREDICTIVE POWER CONFIRMING THAT DIAGNOSIS PATTERNS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE SNA ARE MEANINGFUL IN THE VIOLENCE RECOGNITION. CONCLUSIONS: ROUTINE ED DATA, ANALYZED USING SNA, CAN BE A FIRST-LINE WARNING TO RECOGNIZE WHEN AN AGGRESSION RELATED ACCESS IS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AMONG THREE VULNERABLE POPULATION SUBGROUPS AND CAPTURE TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THEIR PROBABILITY OF BEING EXPOSED TO SARS-COV-2 VIA MOBILITY. METHODS: WE INCLUDED 652 COVID-19 CASES AND UTILIZED EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH MODELS TO BUILD SIX SOCIAL NETWORKS: ONE FOR THE CROSS-SECTIONAL COHORT, AND FIVE FOR THE TEMPORAL WAVE COHORTS, RESPECTIVELY. VERTICES WERE THE THREE VULNERABLE POPULATION SUBGROUPS. EDGES WERE SHARED SCENARIOS WHERE VERTICES WERE EXPOSED TO SARS-COV-2. RESULTS: THE PROBABILITY OF BEING EXPOSED TO A COVID-19 CASE IN HONG KONG AMONG THE THREE VULNERABLE POPULATION SUBGROUPS INCREASED FROM 3.38% IN EARLY 2020 TO 5.78% IN EARLY 2022.

IN RECENT YEARS ARGENTINA HAS IMPLEMENTED A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF SWINE MOVEMENTS AMONGST OTHER MEASURES, IN AN EFFORT TO CONTROL AND EVENTUALLY ERADICATE ENDEMIC AUJESKY'S DISEASE. SUCH INFORMATION CAN PROVE VALUABLE IN ASSESSING THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION BETWEEN FARMS FOR ENDEMIC DISEASES BUT ALSO FOR OTHER DISEASES AT RISK OF EMERGENCE. METHODS: SHIPMENT DATA FROM 2011 TO 2016 WERE ANALYZED IN AN EFFORT TO DEFINE STRATEGIC LOCATIONS AND TIMES AT WHICH CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSED TO PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) WAS USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE NETWORK AS A WHOLE AND AT THE INDIVIDUAL FARM AND MARKET LEVEL TO HELP IDENTIFY IMPORTANT NODES. SPATIO-TEMPORAL TRENDS OF PIG MOVEMENTS WERE ALSO ANALYZED. FINALLY, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLASSIFY FARMS AND MARKETS IN DIFFERENT GROUPS BASED ON THEIR SNA METRICS, WE USED FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR MIXED DATA (FAMD) AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING. RESULTS: THE NETWORK INVOLVED APPROXIMATE 136,000 SHIPMENTS FOR A TOTAL OF 6 MILLION PIGS. OVER 350 MARKETS AND 17,800 PRODUCTION UNITS PARTICIPATED IN SHIPMENTS WITH ANOTHER 83,500 NOT PARTICIPATING. TEMPORAL DATA OF SHIPMENTS AND NETWORK METRICS SHOWED PEAKS IN SHIPMENTS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER. MOST SHIPMENTS WHERE WITHIN PROVINCES, WITH BUENOS AIRES, CORDOBA AND SANTA FE CONCENTRATING 61% OF SHIPMENTS. NETWORK ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MARKETS ARE INVOLVED IN RELATIVELY FEW SHIPMENTS BUT HOLD STRATEGIC POSITIONS WITH MUCH HIGHER BETWEENNESS COMPARED TO FARMS. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING YIELDED FOUR GROUPS BASED ON SNA METRICS AND NODE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH CAN BE BROADLY DESCRIBED AS: 1. SMALL AND BACKYARD FARMS; 2. INDUSTRIAL FARMS; 3. MARKETS; AND 4. A SINGLE OUTLYING MARKET WITH EXTREME CENTRALITY VALUES. CONCLUSION: CHARACTERIZING THE NETWORK STRUCTURE AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ARGENTINE SWINE SHIPMENTS PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT CAN GUIDE TARGETED AND MORE COST-EFFECTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL PROGRAMS. WE LOCATED KEY NODES WHERE EFFORTS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF VCT REFERRAL BY SEXUAL PARTNERS THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS AND THE TEST RESULTS AFTER ELICITED INTERVIEWS WITH MSM; COMPARE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK BEHAVIORS AMONG MSM TESTED WITHOUT REFERRAL, INDEX SUBJECTS, AND REFERRED SEXUAL PARTNERS; AND EXPLORE UNKNOWN SEXUAL AFFILIATIONS THROUGH VISUALIZING AND QUANTIFYING THE SOCIAL NETWORK GRAPH. METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. PURPOSEFUL SAMPLING WAS USED TO RECRUIT INDEX SUBJECTS FROM A COMMUNITY HIV SCREENING STATION FREQUENTED BY MSM IN TAIPEI CITY ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS. RESPONDENT-DRIVEN SAMPLING WAS USED TO RECRUIT SEXUAL PARTNERS. PARTNER-ELICITED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY TRAINED STAFF BEFORE VCT TO MOTIVATE MSM TO BECOME INDEX SUBJECTS AND REFER SEXUAL PARTNERS VIA THE LINE APP, OR TO DISCLOSE THE ACCOUNTS AND PROFILES OF SEXUAL PARTNERS ON RELEVANT SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS. REFERRED SEXUAL PARTNERS RECEIVED RAPID HIV TESTING, AND THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS WAS REPEATED UNTIL LEADS WERE EXHAUSTED. RESULTS: AFTER THE INTERVIEWS, 28.2% (75/266) OF MSM WERE SUCCESSFULLY PERSUADED TO BECOME INDEX SUBJECTS IN THE FIRST WAVE, REFERRING 127 SEXUAL PARTNERS VIA THE LINE APP FOR RAPID HIV TESTING AND DISCLOSING 40 SEXUAL PARTNERS. THE INDEX SUBJECTS AND TESTED SEXUAL PARTNERS HAD MORE SEXUAL PARTNERS (F(2)=3.83, P=.02), MORE FREQUENT ANAL INTERCOURSE (F(2)=10.10, P<.001), AND HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED HIV TESTING (Χ(2)(1)=6.1, P=.047) COMPARED WITH MSM TESTED WITHOUT REFERRALS. THE NEW HIV-SEROPOSITIVITY RATE AMONG TESTED SEXUAL PARTNERS WAS 2.4%, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE RATE IN THE OTHER 2 GROUPS. THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS REVEALED THE FOLLOWING 4 TYPES OF SEXUAL AFFILIATION: CHAIN, Y, STAR, AND COMPLICATED. AMONG THE HIV-NEGATIVE SEXUAL PARTNERS, 26.9% (43/160) HAD SEXUAL AFFILIATIONS WITH HIV-POSITIVE NODES, AND 40% (10/25) WERE UNTESTED SEXUAL PARTNERS WITH A DIRECT SEXUAL AFFILIATION WITH AN HIV-POSITIVE NODE. FOUR TRANSMISSION BRIDGES WERE FOUND IN THE NETWORK GRAPH. CONCLUSIONS: PARTNER-ELICITED INTERVIEWS CAN EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE REFERRAL FOR HIV TESTING AND CASE IDENTIFICATION VIA LINE, AND CAN CLARIFY UNKNOWN SEXUAL AFFILIATIONS OF MSM TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TAILORED PREVENTION PROGRAM.

THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO REVEAL THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DRIVING FACTORS OF THE SOCIAL RUMORS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 1,537 RUMORS COLLECTED FROM SINA WEIBO'S DEBUNKING ACCOUNT, THIS PAPER FIRST DIVIDED THE SAMPLE INTO FOUR CATEGORIES AND CALCULATED THE RISK LEVEL OF ALL KINDS OF RUMORS. THEN, TIME EVOLUTION ANALYSIS AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS WERE ADOPTED TO STUDY THE TIME EVOLUTION CHARACTERISTICS AND THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CORRELATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RUMORS, AND THE FOUR STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT WERE ALSO DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF RUMORS. BESIDES, TO EXTRACT THE KEY DRIVING FACTORS FROM 15 RUMOR-DRIVING FACTORS, THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS METHOD WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE DRIVER-DRIVER 1-MODE NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS, THE GENERATION DRIVER-RUMOR 2-MODE NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE SPREADING DRIVER-RUMOR 2-MODE CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS: RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF RUMORS RELATED TO COVID-19 WERE GRADUALLY DECREASED AS THE OUTBREAK WAS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL, WHICH PROVED THE IMPORTANCE OF EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL STABILITY. COMBINING THE NUMBER AND RISK PERCEPTION LEVELS OF THE FOUR TYPES OF RUMORS, IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT THE CREATING PANIC-TYPE RUMORS WERE THE MOST HARMFUL TO SOCIETY. THE RESULTS OF RUMOR DRIVERS INDICATED THAT PANIC PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LAG IN RELEASING GOVERNMENT INFORMATION PLAYED AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN DRIVING THE GENERATION AND SPREAD OF RUMORS. THE PUBLIC'S LOW SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND DIFFICULTY IN DISCERNING HIGHLY CONFUSING RUMORS ENCOURAGED THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN SPREADING RUMORS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REVEALED THE MECHANISM OF RUMORS.

THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO COMMUNAL LIVING IN HIGH-DENSITY AND UNHYGIENIC DORMITORY SETTINGS AND A LACK OF INCLUSIVE PROTECTION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ROLES OF SOCIAL AND GEOSPATIAL NETWORKS IN COVID-19 TRANSMISSION. THE STUDY EXAMINED THE NETWORKS OF NON-WORK-RELATED ACTIVITIES AMONG MIGRANT WORKERS TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCKDOWN EXIT STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS. METHODS: A POPULATION-BASED SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 509 MIGRANT WORKERS ACROSS THE NATION, AND IT ASSESSED DORMITORY ATTRIBUTES, SOCIAL TIES, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS, COVID-19-RELATED VARIABLES AND MOBILITY PATTERNS USING A GRID-BASED NETWORK QUESTIONNAIRE. MOBILITY PATHS FROM DORMITORIES WERE PRESENTED BASED ON PURPOSES OF VISIT. TWO-MODE SOCIAL NETWORKS EXAMINED THE STRUCTURES AND POSITIONS OF NETWORKS BETWEEN WORKERS AND VISIT AREAS WITH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES. RESULTS: COVID-19 RISK EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DENSITY OF DORMITORY, SOCIAL TIES AND VISIT AREAS. THE MIGRANT WORKER HUB IN THE CITY CENTRE WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY VISITED FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES OF GROCERY SHOPPING AND REMITTANCE, FOLLOWED BY SOUTH CENTRAL AREAS MAINLY FOR SOCIAL GATHERING. THE HUB WAS POSITIONED AS THE CORE WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CENTRALITY WITH A CLUSTER OF WORKERS EXPOSED TO COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: SOCIAL AND GEOSPATIAL NETWORKS OF MIGRANT WORKERS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCKDOWN EXIT STRATEGIES WHILE ADDRESSING THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONS AND MONITORING SYSTEMS.

MIXED EFFECT MODELS SHOW THAT THERE IS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF THE PERIOD (2004-2006 VS 2015-2017) IN THE VALUES OF NINE OF THE 13 NETWORK METRICS. FOR EXAMPLE MEDIAN TOTAL DEGREE DECREASED BY 19%. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING NETWORKS FOR TWO TIME PERIODS, TWO UPDATES OF THE DATA WERE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE BY HOW MUCH THE MOVEMENT DATA STORED FOR 2004-2006 HAD BEEN CLEANSED BETWEEN UPDATES. EXAMINATION OF THESE UPDATES SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SMALL DECREASES IN PROBLEM MOVEMENTS (SUCH AS ANIMALS LEAVING SLAUGHTERHOUSES) AND THEREFORE EVIDENCE OF HISTORICAL DATA BEING IMPROVED BETWEEN UPDATES. IN COMBINATION WITH THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF PERIOD ON MANY OF THE NETWORK METRICS, THE MODIFICATION OF DATA BETWEEN UPDATES PROVIDES FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE DATA SHOULD BE USED FOR NETWORK MODELLING. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NETWORK ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE MODELLING RESULTS TO BEST INFORM POLICY MAKERS.","S0167-5877(21)00268-3","1873-1716 (ELECTRONIC) 0167-5877 (LINKING)","PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE","105524","QUANTIFYING CHANGES IN THE BRITISH CATTLE MOVEMENT NETWORK","198",2022,"ISI","PREV VET MED",0,"none","INVERNESS COLLEGE UHI, 1 INVERNESS CAMPUS, INVERNESS IV2 5NA, UK; EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE, NORTHERN FACULTY, SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC), AN LÒCHRAN, 10 INVERNESS CAMPUS, INVERNESS IV2 5NA, UK.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: ANDREW.;DUNCAN.;IC@UHI.;AC.;UK.; EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE, NORTHERN FACULTY, SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC), AN LÒCHRAN, 10 INVERNESS CAMPUS, INVERNESS IV2 5NA, UK; SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S CENTRE OF EXPERTISE ON ANIMAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS (EPIC), UK.; EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE, NORTHERN FACULTY, SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC), AN LÒCHRAN, 10 INVERNESS CAMPUS, INVERNESS IV2 5NA, UK; SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S CENTRE OF EXPERTISE ON ANIMAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS (EPIC), UK.; EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE, NORTHERN FACULTY, SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC), AN LÒCHRAN, 10 INVERNESS CAMPUS, INVERNESS IV2 5NA, UK.;","INVERNESS COLLEGE UHI;SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC);ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: ANDREW.;SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC);SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S CENTRE OF EXPERTISE ON ANIMAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS (EPIC);SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC);SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S CENTRE OF EXPERTISE ON ANIMAL DISEASE OUTBREAKS (EPIC);SCOTLAND'S RURAL COLLEGE (SRUC)","DUNCAN AJ, 2022, PREV VET MED","DUNCAN AJ, 2022, PREV VET MED"

THE CURRENT STUDY USED LONGITUDINAL SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE INTERPLAY OF NATIONAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT AND FRIENDSHIP NETWORK DYNAMICS AMONG IMMIGRANT AND NON-IMMIGRANT ADOLESCENTS IN GREECE (N = 1252; 46% FEMALE). ALL YOUTH WITH HIGHER NATIONAL IDENTITY RESOLUTION (I.E., YOUTH'S SENSE OF CLARITY REGARDING THEIR IDENTITY AS A MEMBER OF GREEK SOCIETY) IN GRADE 8 WERE MORE OFTEN NOMINATED AS A FRIEND IN GRADE 9. DURING THE TRANSITION FROM 8TH TO 9TH GRADE, ALL YOUTH BECAME MORE SIMILAR TO THEIR NOMINATED FRIENDS IN TERMS OF THEIR GREEK NATIONAL IDENTITY EXPLORATION (I.E., DEGREE TO WHICH THEY HAD ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT GREEK SOCIETY). DURING THE TRANSITION FROM 7TH TO 8TH GRADE, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN PEER SELECTION ON NATIONAL IDENTITY EXPLORATION AND RESOLUTION BETWEEN IMMIGRANT AND NON-IMMIGRANT YOUTH. SPECIFICALLY, IMMIGRANT YOUTH DEMONSTRATED SELECTION EFFECTS CONSISTENT WITH NOTIONS OF HOMOPHILY, SUCH THAT THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO NOMINATE PEERS IN 8TH GRADE WHOSE LEVELS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY EXPLORATION AND RESOLUTION WERE SIMILAR TO THEIR OWN WHEN IN 7TH GRADE. IN CONTRAST, NON-IMMIGRANT YOUTH PREFERRED PEERS IN 8TH GRADE WITH LOW LEVELS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY EXPLORATION (REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN LEVELS OF EXPLORATION IN 7TH GRADE) AND PEERS WHOSE LEVELS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY RESOLUTION IN 8TH GRADE WERE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN IN 7TH GRADE (E.G., NON-IMMIGRANT YOUTH WHO REPORTED HIGH NATIONAL IDENTITY RESOLUTION IN 7TH GRADE WERE MORE LIKELY TO NOMINATE PEERS WHO HAD LOW NATIONAL IDENTITY RESOLUTION IN 8TH GRADE). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BY IMMIGRANT STATUS IN PEER INFLUENCE, SUGGESTING THAT THE SIGNIFICANT PEER INFLUENCE EFFECTS THAT EMERGED DURING THE TRANSITION FROM 8TH TO 9TH GRADE IN WHICH YOUTH BECAME MORE SIMILAR TO THEIR FRIENDS IN NATIONAL IDENTITY EXPLORATION MAY REFLECT A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.

METHODS: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH LONGITUDINAL ASSESSMENTS AS PART OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AMONG APPALACHIAN PEOPLE (SNAP) STUDY (2008-2017). STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED INTERVIEWER-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES THAT COLLECTED SOCIAL NETWORK DATA VIA FREE-LISTING AT BASELINE AND SIX-MONTH INTERVALS. AT VISIT 5, AFTER FREE-LISTING, INTERVIEWERS PROMPTED PARTICIPANTS WITH THE NAMES OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ALTERS. WE USED MODIFIED POISSON REGRESSION WITH GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL- AND RELATIONSHIP-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ALTER BEING REPORTED ONLY AFTER PROMPTING. WE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING VS. EXCLUDING RELATIONSHIPS REPORTED AFTER PROMPTING ON LOCAL AND GLOBAL SOCIOMETRIC NETWORK MEASURES (I.E., BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY, BRIDGING, DENSITY, MEAN DEGREE, TRANSITIVITY, CLIQUES, AND 2-CORES). RESULTS: RELATIONSHIPS REPORTED ONLY AFTER PROMPTING WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMMEDIATE FAMILY (ADJUSTED PREVALENCE RATIO [APR]:1.29; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 1.03-1.63) AND LESS LIKELY TO INVOLVE SEX (APR:0.54; 95% CI: 0.43-0.67).

A KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL POSITION ON SMOKING DEPENDS ON AN ADOLESCENT'S LEVEL OF COPING MOTIVES (I.E., THEIR DESIRE TO USE SMOKING TO MITIGATE NEGATIVE AFFECT). METHOD: WE ASSESSED HOW SOCIAL POSITION PREDICTS NICOTINE DEPENDENCE IN A LONGITUDINAL SAMPLE (N = 3,717; 44.8% MALE; MEAN AGE = 13.41 YEARS) OF ADOLESCENT LIFETIME SMOKERS MEASURED BETWEEN 6TH AND 12TH GRADES. USING BOTH SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MULTILEVEL MODELING, WE ASSESSED THIS QUESTION AT THE BETWEEN-PERSON AND WITHIN-PERSON LEVEL, HYPOTHESIZING THAT WITHIN-PERSON DECREASES IN SOCIAL POSITION WOULD LEAD TO INCREASED RISK OF NICOTINE DEPENDENCE AMONG THOSE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF COPING MOTIVES. RESULTS: IN CONTRAST TO OUR HYPOTHESES, ONLY INTERACTIONS WITH THE BETWEEN-PERSON MEASURES OF SOCIAL POSITION WERE FOUND, WITH A SLIGHT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP AT LOW LEVELS OF COPING MOTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE MAIN EFFECT OF COPING MOTIVES WAS CONSIDERABLY STRONGER THAN THAT OF SOCIAL POSITION AT THE BETWEEN-PERSON LEVEL, AND SOCIAL POSITION HAD NO SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-PERSON MAIN EFFECT ON NICOTINE DEPENDENCE RISK. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOLESCENTS WITH HIGHER OVERALL LEVELS OF SOCIAL POSITION AMONG THEIR PEERS MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY DECREASED RISK FOR NICOTINE DEPENDENCE, BUT ONLY WHEN COPING MOTIVES ARE LOW.

OUR MODEL UTILIZED EQUINE INFECTIOUS ANEMIA VIRUS (EIAV) OUTBREAKS, BETWEEN-FARM HORSE MOVEMENTS, AND SPATIAL LANDSCAPE DATA FROM 2015 THROUGH 2017. WE RELATED EIAV OCCURRENCE AND THE MOVEMENT OF HORSES BETWEEN FARMS WITH CLIMATE VARIABLES THAT FOSTER CONDITIONS FOR LOCAL DISEASE PROPAGATION. WE THEN CONSTRUCTED A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODEL THAT ALLOWS THE EFFECT OF THE CLIMATE VARIABLES ON EIAV OCCURRENCE TO VARY THROUGH SPACE (I.E., NON-STATIONARY). OUR RESULTS IDENTIFIED IMPORTANT AREAS IN WHICH IN-GOING MOVEMENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO RESULT IN EIAV INFECTIONS AND DISEASE PROPAGATION. MUNICIPALITIES WERE THEN CLASSIFIED AS HAVING HIGH 56 (11.3%), MEDIUM 48 (9.66%), AND LOW 393 (79.1%) SPATIAL RISK. THE MAJORITY OF THE MOVEMENTS WERE BETWEEN LOW-RISK AREAS, ALTOGETHER REPRESENTING 68.68% OF ALL ANIMAL MOVEMENTS. MEANWHILE, 9.48% WERE WITHIN HIGH-RISK AREAS, AND 6.20% WERE WITHIN MEDIUM-RISK AREAS. ONLY 5.37% OF THE ANIMALS ENTERING LOW-RISK AREAS CAME FROM HIGH-RISK AREAS. ON THE OTHER HAND, 4.91% OF THE ANIMALS IN THE HIGH-RISK AREAS CAME FROM LOW- AND MEDIUM-RISK AREAS.

METHODS: WE ASSESSED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS AND PREVALENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION AMONG RESIDENTS (AGED ≥15 YEARS) OF 9 RURAL COMMUNITIES IN EASTERN UGANDA. SOCIAL CONTACTS NAMED DURING A CENSUS WERE USED TO CREATE COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC NONHOUSEHOLD SOCIAL NETWORKS. WE EVALUATED WHETHER SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF FIRST-DEGREE CONTACTS (SEX, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS [HIV] STATUS, TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REVALENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION (POSITIVE TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST [TST] RESULT) AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL RISK FACTORS (AGE, SEX, HIV STATUS, TUBERCULOSIS CONTACT, WEALTH, OCCUPATION, AND BACILLUS CALMETTE-GUÉRIN [BCG] VACCINATION) WITH TARGETED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER AND HOW PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CAN AFFECT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POLICY RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA. METHODS: THIS STUDY CONSTRUCTS THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IS USED TO ANALYZE DATA ON THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, NEW MEDIA, AND THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IN THIS PANDEMIC. RESULTS: FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE CHINESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ALWAYS ADOPT TOP-DOWN ELITIST GOVERNANCE STRATEGIES IN RISK MANAGEMENT. THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO ADOPT THE BOTTOM-UP GOVERNANCE STRATEGY TRIGGERED BY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. IN THIS PROCESS, NEW MEDIA ACTS AS A CATALYST. SPECIFICALLY, WHEN FACED WITH A PUBLIC EMERGENCY AND NEEDS A POLICY RESPONSE FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FIRSTLY CREATES ""PARTICIPATION"" WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE MEDIA, FORMS PUBLIC OPINION, AND THEN THE PROMPT POLICY RESPONSE FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL REFER TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO DECIDE THE POLICY RESPONSE. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE THEORY OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE APPLIES TO BOTH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.","10.3389/FPUBH.2022.842373","2296-2565 (ELECTRONIC) 2296-2565 (LINKING)","FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH","842373","WHETHER SOCIAL PARTICIPATION CAN AFFECT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC POLICY RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 IN CHINA","10",2022,"ISI","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH",0,"none","COLLEGE OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS, CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE SURVEY AND DATA TIANJIN UNIVERSITY, TIANJIN, CHINA.; COLLEGE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, QINGHAI MINZU UNIVERSITY, XINING, CHINA.; COLLEGE OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS, CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE SURVEY AND DATA TIANJIN UNIVERSITY, TIANJIN, CHINA.; SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AND MANAGEMENT, TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA.;","CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE SURVEY AND DATA TIANJIN UNIVERSITY;QINGHAI MINZU UNIVERSITY;CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE SURVEY AND DATA TIANJIN UNIVERSITY;TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY","FU L, 2022, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","FU L, 2022, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH"

THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE CARE AND SUPPORT NETWORKS OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER PEOPLE ACCESSING A FALLS PREVENTION SERVICE AS A MARKER OF LIKELY FRAILTY, BY DESCRIBING AND COMPARING THE INDIVIDUALS' NETWORKS AS PERCEIVED BY THEMSELVES AND AS PERCEIVED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN THEIR CARE. METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 16 PATIENTS AND 16 ASSOCIATED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WERE RECRUITED FROM A COMMUNITY-BASED NHS 'FALLS GROUP' PROGRAMME WITHIN NORTH-WEST LONDON. INDIVIDUAL (I.E., ONE ON ONE) SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERCEIVED NETWORK. PRINCIPLES OF QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) HELPED IDENTIFY THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NETWORKS; QUALITATIVE SNA AND A THEMATIC ANALYSIS AIDED DATA INTERPRETATION. RESULTS: ALL REPORTED CARE AND SUPPORT NETWORKS SHOWED A HIGH CONTRIBUTION LEVEL FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.

A GROWING BODY OF WORK SUGGESTS THAT COALITION NETWORK TIES, WHICH FACILITATE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AND ADVOCACY, MAY BE A KEY PART OF HOW SUCH LEADERSHIP OPERATES. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF COALITION NETWORKS AND HOW THIS STRUCTURE CHANGES OVER TIME. METHODS: WE ADMINISTERED SEMIANNUAL NETWORK SURVEYS DURING A PILOT WHOLE-OF-COMMUNITY INTERVENTION IN SOMERVILLE, MA (2015-2017). PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 16 MULTISECTOR COALITION MEMBERS AND THEIR NOMINATED DISCUSSION PARTNERS (""FIRST-DEGREE ALTERS"") RELATED TO CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION. COALITION AND FIRST-DEGREE ALTER RESPONDENTS NAMED UP TO 20 DISCUSSION PARTNERS AND REPORTED TIES' INTERACTION FREQUENCY AND PERCEIVED INFLUENCE. NETWORKS WERE ASSESSED WITH VISUALIZATION, DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, AND EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH MODELS. RESULTS: TOTAL NETWORK INCLUDED 558 STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, PARENTS, HEALTH CARE, CHILDCARE, UNIVERSITIES, AMONG OTHERS. SIZE AND MEMBERSHIP VARIED OVER TIME. WE OBSERVED THE LARGEST NETWORK (N = 256) DURING INTERVENTION PLANNING, AND THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNICATING FREQUENTLY (DAILY/WEEKLY) ABOUT CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION DURING THE PEAK INTERVENTION PERIOD.

WE USED STATIC AND TEMPORAL NETWORK APPROACHES TO DESCRIBE PIG TRADE IN THE STATE BY QUANTIFYING NETWORK ATTRIBUTES USING SNA PARAMETERS, SUCH AS CAUSAL FIDELITY, LOYALTY, THE PROPORTION OF NODE-LOYALTY, RESILIENCE OF OUTGOING CONTACT CHAINS, AND COMMUNITIES. TWO INDEXES WERE IMPLEMENTED, THE FIRST ONE IS A NORMALIZED INDEX BASED ON SNA-FARM LEVEL MEASURES AND OTHER INDEX-BASED SNA-FARM LEVEL MEASURES CONSIDERING THE SWINEHERD POPULATION SIZE FROM ALL PREMISES, BOTH INDEXES WERE SUMMARIZED BY A MUNICIPALITY TO TARGET AND RANK SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES. WITHIN SANTA CATARINA, THE SOUTHWEST REGION PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THAT 80 % OF TRADE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THIS REGION, AND THUS ACTED AS A HUB IN THE NETWORK. BESIDES, NINE COMMUNITIES WERE FOUND.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEFINE RISK FACTORS FOR CONTRACTING MRSA IN A TERTIARY HEALTH CARE FACILITY USING A HISTORIC CASE-CONTROL STUDY AND TO VALIDATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK CHANGES DURING PRE-OUTBREAK AND OUTBREAK PERIODS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A CASE-CONTROL STUDY USING SECONDARY DATA ON HOSPITALIZATIONS WHERE INFECTED OR COLONIZED CASES WERE COMPARED WITH MATCHED CONTROLS WHO TESTED NEGATIVE BY AGE, SEX, AND CAMPUS OVER 1 YEAR. SOCIAL NETWORKS OF ALL CASES AND CONTROLS WERE BUILT FROM LINKS JOINING PATIENTS TO ROOMS, ROOMMATES, AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OVER TIME. RESULTS: MATCHED CONTROLS WERE SIMILAR TO CASES IN COMORBIDITY, LENGTHS OF STAY, MORTALITY, AND NUMBER OF ROOMMATES, ROOMS, AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AS EXPECTED, THE NUMBER OF ROOMS AND ROOMMATES INCREASED IN THE OUTBREAK BY MORE THAN 50%. A TIMED ANIMATION OF THE NETWORK AT ONE CAMPUS IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL SOURCE PATIENTS LINKED TO 2 ROOMS AND MANY ROOMMATES, AFTER WHICH CASES CONNECTED TO THOSE SAME ROOMS PROLIFERATED.

ADVERSITY CONTEXTS BUILD MODELS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR BASED ON RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF STUDIES THAT ANALYSE THE BEHAVIOUR OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC. THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USEFUL IN MAKING DECISIONS ON HOW TO PLAN COLLECTIVE RESPONSES TO ADVERSITIES. THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) METHOD HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO ADDRESS THIS STRUCTURAL PERSPECTIVE. THE AIM OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOUR OF STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITY RESIDENCES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WITH A MORE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF STUDENT LEADERS. A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT ONE SPANISH PUBLIC UNIVERSITY, LEÓN, FROM 23TH OCTOBER 2020 TO 20TH NOVEMBER 2020. THE PARTICIPATION WAS OF 93 STUDENTS, FROM FOUR HALLS OF RESIDENCE. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A DATABASE CREATED SPECIFICALLY AT THE UNIVERSITY TO ""TRACK"" CONTACTS IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, SIVEULE. WE APPLIED THE SNA FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. THE LEADERSHIP ON THE UNIVERSITY RESIDENCE WAS MEASURED USING CENTRALITY MEASURES. THE TOP LEADERS WERE ANALYZED USING THE EGONETWORK AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE KEY PLAYERS. STUDENTS WITH HIGHER SOCIAL REPUTATIONS EXPERIENCE HIGHER LEVELS OF PANDEMIC CONTAGION IN RELATION TO COVID-19 INFECTION. THE RESULTS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN THE CENTRALITY IN THE NETWORK AND THE RESULTS OF THE COVID-19 INFECTION. THE MOST LEADING STUDENTS SHOWED A HIGH DEGREE OF BETWEENNESS, AND THREE STUDENTS HAD THE KEY PLAYER STRUCTURE IN THE NETWORK. NETWORKING BEHAVIOUR OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN HALLS OF RESIDENCE COULD BE RELATED TO CONTAGION IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS COULD BE DESCRIBED ON THE BASIS OF ASPECTS OF SIMILARITIES BETWEEN STUDENTS, AND EVEN LEADERS CONNECTING THE COHABITATION SUB-NETWORKS. IN THIS CONTEXT, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR FUTURE NETWORK STUDIES IN HEALTH EMERGENCY CONTEXTS.","10.1038/S41598-021-94383-2","2045-2322 (ELECTRONIC) 2045-2322 (LINKING)","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","14877","A CASE STUDY OF UNIVERSITY STUDENT NETWORKS AND THE COVID19 PANDEMIC USING A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS APPROACH IN HALLS OF RESIDENCE","11",2021,"ISI","SCI REP",0,"none","SALBIS RESEARCH GROUP, DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRIC, SYSTEMS AND AUTOMATICS ENGINEERING, UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, CAMPUS OF VEGAZANA S/N, 24071, LEÓN, SPAIN.; THE RESEARCH GROUP IN GEN-ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH INTERACTIONS (GIIGAS), INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICINE (IBIOMED), UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, 24071, LEÓN, SPAIN.; SALBIS RESEARCH GROUP, DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRIC, SYSTEMS AND AUTOMATICS ENGINEERING, UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, CAMPUS OF VEGAZANA S/N, 24071, LEÓN, SPAIN.; CARMEN.;BENAVIDES@UNILEON.;ES.; FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS DE LA SALUD, UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, CAMPUS OF VEGAZANA S/N, 24071, LEÓN, SPAIN.; THE RESEARCH GROUP IN GEN-ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH INTERACTIONS (GIIGAS), INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICINE (IBIOMED), UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, 24071, LEÓN, SPAIN.; THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTRE NETWORK FOR EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH (CIBERESP), 28029, MADRID, SPAIN.; SALBIS RESEARCH GROUP, DEPARTMENT OF NURSING AND PHYSIOTHERAPY, UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, CAMPUS DE PONFERRADA S/N, 24400, PONFERRADA, SPAIN.;","UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTRE NETWORK FOR EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH (CIBERESP);UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN","BENÍTEZ-ANDRADES JA, 2021, SCI REP","BENÍTEZ-ANDRADES JA, 2021, SCI REP"

WHILE INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS OF INFECTION ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT NETWORK FACTORS, WITH MINIMAL DATA BEYOND DIRECT TIES. METHODS: 2512 PWID IN NEW DELHI, INDIA WERE RECRUITED IN 2017-19 USING A SOCIOMETRIC NETWORK DESIGN. SAMPLING WAS INITIATED WITH 10 INDEXES WHO RECRUITED NAMED INJECTION PARTNERS (PEOPLE WHO THEY INJECTED WITH IN THE PRIOR MONTH). EACH RECRUIT THEN RECRUITED THEIR NAMED INJECTION PARTNERS FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCESS WITH CROSS-NETWORK LINKAGES ESTABLISHED BY BIOMETRIC DATA. PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED TO A SURVEY, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON INJECTION VENUES, AND PROVIDED A BLOOD SAMPLE. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIV/HCV INFECTION WERE IDENTIFIED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE WAS 26; 99% WERE MALE. BASELINE HIV PREVALENCE WAS 37.0% AND 46.8% WERE ACTIVELY INFECTED WITH HCV (HCV RNA POSITIVE). THE ODDS OF PREVALENT HIV AND ACTIVE HCV INFECTION DECREASED WITH EACH ADDITIONAL DEGREE OF SEPARATION FROM AN INFECTED ALTER (HIV AOR: 0.87; HCV AOR: 0.90) AND INCREASED AMONG THOSE WHO INJECTED AT A SPECIFIC VENUE (HIV AOR: 1.50; HCV AOR: 1.69) INDEPENDENT OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL FACTORS (P<0.001). IN ADDITION, SOCIOMETRIC FACTORS, FOR EXAMPLE, NETWORK DISTANCE TO AN INFECTED ALTER, WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS EVEN WHEN CONSIDERING IMMEDIATE EGOCENTRIC TIES.

THE FORWARDING BEHAVIOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ON POSTS CONCERNED WITH COVID-19 VACCINE TOPICS CAN RAPIDLY DISSEMINATE VACCINE INFORMATION IN A SHORT PERIOD, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON TRANSMISSION AND HELPS THE PUBLIC ACCESS RELEVANT INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THE FACTORS OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS' FORWARDING POSTS ARE STILL UNCERTAIN THUS FAR. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATED THE FACTORS OF THE FORWARDING COVID-19 VACCINES WEIBO POSTS ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA AND VERIFIED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOCIAL NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS, WEIBO TEXTUAL SENTIMENT CHARACTERISTICS, AND POST FORWARDING. METHODS: THIS PAPER USED DATA MINING, MACHINE LEARNING, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS. USING "" (COVID-19 VACCINE)"" AS THE KEYWORD, WE USED DATA MINING TO CRAWL 121,834 WEIBO POSTS ON SINA WEIBO FROM 1 JANUARY 2021 TO 31 MAY 2021. WEIBO POSTS NOT CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THE TOPIC OF THE COVID-19 VACCINES WERE FILTERED OUT USING MACHINE LEARNING. IN THE END, 3,158 POSTS WERE USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. THE PROPORTIONS OF POSITIVE SENTIMENT AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT IN THE TEXTUAL OF WEIBO POSTS WERE CALCULATED THROUGH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. ON THAT BASIS, THE SENTIMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF WEIBO POSTS WERE DETERMINED. THE SOCIAL NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION TRANSMISSION ON THE COVID-19 VACCINE TOPIC WERE DETERMINED THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOCIAL NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS, SENTIMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TEXT, AND THE FORWARDING VOLUME OF POSTS WAS VERIFIED THROUGH REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF POSTING USERS IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AND THE AMOUNT OF FORWARDING. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CLOSENESS CENTRALITY AND THE FORWARDING VOLUME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE. THE BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE FORWARDING VOLUME. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF POSTS CONTAINING MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENTS AND THE FORWARDING VOLUME OF POSTS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF WEIBO POSTS CONTAINING MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS AND THE FORWARDING VOLUME. CONCLUSION: ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF USERS, COVID-19 VACCINE POSTS FROM OPINION LEADERS, ""GATEKEEPERS,"" AND USERS WITH HIGH-CLOSENESS CENTRALITY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REPOSTED. USERS WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE VALUED FOR THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINES. IN ADDITION, THE SENTIMENT CONTAINED IN THE WEIBO POST IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING THE PUBLIC TO FORWARD VACCINE POSTS. SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE NEGATIVE SENTIMENTAL TENDENCY CONTAINED IN THIS POST ON WEIBO TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE INFORMATION EPIDEMIC AND IMPROVE THE TRANSMISSION EFFECT OF COVID-19 VACCINE INFORMATION.","10.3389/FPUBH.2022.871722","2296-2565 (ELECTRONIC) 2296-2565 (LINKING)","FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH","871722","THE IMPACT FACTORS OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS FORWARDING BEHAVIOR OF COVID19 VACCINE TOPIC BASED ON EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CHINESE WEIBO USERS","10",2022,"ISI","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH",0,"none","SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM AND COMMUNICATION, JINAN UNIVERSITY, GUANGZHOU, CHINA.; SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM AND COMMUNICATION, JINAN UNIVERSITY, GUANGZHOU, CHINA.; SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM AND COMMUNICATION, JINAN UNIVERSITY, GUANGZHOU, CHINA.;","JINAN UNIVERSITY;JINAN UNIVERSITY;JINAN UNIVERSITY","SUN K, 2022, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","SUN K, 2022, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH"

HETEROSEXUAL CYCLE (HET4) OF NATIONAL HIV BEHAVIORAL SURVEILLANCE (NHBS) IS A SOCIAL NETWORK STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED IN JURISDICTIONS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE TO 1) EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF THE NHBS HET CYCLE DATA FOR NETWORK ANALYSIS; 2) TO APPLY STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN SUPPORT OF PREVIOUS HIV RESEARCH, AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP NEW RESEARCH RESULTS FOCUSED ON DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AND PREVENTION/INTERVENTION WITH RESPECT TO HETEROSEXUAL HIV RISK; AND 3) TO EMPLOY NHBS DATA TO INFORM POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE EHE PLAN. METHOD: WE USED DATA FROM THE 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A TOTAL OF 747 SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED. WE USED THE FREE SOCIAL-NETWORK ANALYSIS PACKAGE, GEPHI, FOR ALL NETWORK VISUALIZATION USING ADJACENCY MATRIX REPRESENTATION. WE ADDITIONALLY CONDUCTED LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF SELECTED VARIABLES WITH HIV STATUS IN THREE MODELS REPRESENTING 1) DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS, 2) BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS, AND 3) PREVENTION-INTERVENTION EFFECTS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED 3% WERE TESTED POSITIVE. SEED 1 INITIATED THE LARGEST NETWORKS WITH 426 NODES (15 POSITIVES); SEED 4 WITH 273 NODES (6 POSITIVES). SEED 3 HAD 35 NODES (2 POSITIVES). ALL 23 HIV DIAGNOSES WERE RECRUITED FROM 4 ZIP-CODES ACROSS DC. THE RISK OF TESTING POSITIVE WAS HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUTS (RELATIVE RISK (RR) (25.645); 95 CI% 5.699, 115.987), UNEMPLOYED ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), RETURNING CITIZENS ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). WE ALSO FOUND IN THE FINAL MODEL HIGHER ASSOCIATION OF PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) AWARENESS AMONG THOSE TESTED NEGATIVE ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) AND HIV INTERVENTION IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS WITH THOSE TESTED POSITIVE ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: THE NETWORK VISUALIZATION WAS USED TO ADDRESS THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE ANALYSIS-EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NHBS AS A SOCIAL NETWORK STRATEGY TO FIND NEW DIAGNOSES. NHBS REMAINS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BEHAVIORAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR DC'S HIV PLANNING ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS OUR ANALYSIS HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF DEMOGRAPHIC, BEHAVIORAL, AND PREVENTION EFFORTS ON PEOPLES' HIV STATUS.

TO PROPOSE THE PRECISE STRATEGY FOR SUPERVISION OF PIG MOVEMENTS IN HUNAN PROVINCE, A WEIGHTED DIRECTED ONE-MODE NETWORK WAS CONSTRUCTED USING THE DATA FROM THE ELECTRONIC ANIMAL HEALTH CERTIFICATE PLATFORM IN 2017. THE NODES WERE DESIGNED AS DISTRICTS IN HUNAN AND EDGES AS FLOWS OF PIG MOVEMENT BETWEEN DISTRICTS. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WERE PERFORMED TO ASCERTAIN THE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PIG MOVEMENT NETWORK. DURING 2017, THE PIG MOVEMENT NETWORK WITHIN THE HUNAN PROVINCE WAS COMPOSED OF 122 NODES AND 8562 DIRECTED CONNECTIONS, WITH A TOTAL OF 510,973 SHIPMENTS AND 17,815,040 PIGS MOVED. THE NETWORK DISPLAYED A SMALL-WORLD TOPOLOGY, WHICH HAD A HIGHER CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT (0.4 VS. 0.1) AND SHORTER AVERAGE SHORTEST PATH LENGTH (1.8 VS. 3.7) COMPARED WITH EQUIVALENT RANDOM NETWORKS. THE DEGREE CENTRALITY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CLOSENESS CENTRALITY (R = 0.99, P < 0.001) AS WELL AS BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY (R = 0.91, P < 0.001). AFTER RESTRICTING THE CROSS-REGIONAL PIG MOVEMENTS IN AREAS WITH THE TOP 10 % OF DEGREE CENTRALITY, THE NUMBER OF PIGS WAS REDUCED BY NEARLY 50 % IN THE NETWORK, WHEREAS THE NUMBER OF PIGS WAS REDUCED BY 94.0 % WHEN MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN AREAS WITH THE TOP 50 % OF DEGREE CENTRALITY. OBSERVED NETWORK METRICS SHOWED AN UPWARD TREND DURING THE MONTHS OF 2017, PEAKING IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS SHOWED THAT THE SIZE OF THE HUMAN POPULATION AND PER CAPITA GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIOECONOMIC DRIVERS OF PIG MOVEMENTS. THE PIG MOVEMENT NETWORK IN HUNAN PROVINCE IS A SMALL-WORLD NETWORK IN WHICH THE INTRODUCTION AND SPREAD OF DISEASES MAY BE QUICKER. MORE HUMAN, MATERIAL, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO AREAS WITH HIGHER CENTRALITY. SWINE MOVEMENTS WERE SEASONAL, AND THE INSPECTION AND QUARANTINE WORK SHOULD BE REINFORCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.

DAIRY CATTLE MAY BE MOVED BETWEEN FARMS OVER LONG DISTANCES, AND HENCE UNDERSTANDING THE ROUTE AND FREQUENCY OF THE MOVEMENTS IS ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH THE PATTERN OF SPREAD OF BTB BETWEEN FARMS, WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HELP TO INFORM POLICY MAKERS TO DESIGN COST EFFECTIVE CONTROL STRATEGIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS, THEREFORE, TO INVESTIGATE THE NETWORK STRUCTURE OF DAIRY CATTLE MOVEMENT AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE TRANSMISSION AND PREVALENCE OF BTB IN THREE EMERGING AREAS AMONG THE ETHIOPIAN DAIRY BELTS, NAMELY THE CITIES OF HAWASSA, GONDAR AND MEKELLE. METHODS: A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN 278 FARMS TO COLLECT DATA ON THE PATTERN OF DAIRY CATTLE MOVEMENT FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS (SEPTEMBER 2013 TO AUGUST 2018). VISUALIZATION OF THE NETWORK STRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NETWORK PATTERNS AND THE PREVALENCE OF BTB IN THESE REGIONS WERE MADE USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE CATTLE MOVEMENT NETWORK STRUCTURE DISPLAY BOTH SCALE FREE AND SMALL WORLD PROPERTIES IMPLYING LOCAL CLUSTERING WITH FEWER FARMS BEING HIGHLY CONNECTED, AT HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS SUPER SPREADERS OF BTB IF INFECTED. FARMS HAVING A HISTORY OF CATTLE MOVEMENTS ONTO THE HERDS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY BTB (OR: 2.2) COMPARED TO FARMS NOT HAVING A LINK HISTORY. EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN FARMS AND THE BATCH SIZE OF ANIMALS MOVED ON WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PREVALENCE OF BTB. ON THE OTHER HAND, FARMS HAVING ONE OR MORE OUTGOING CATTLE SHOWED A DECREASE ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF BTB INFECTION (OR = 0.57) COMPARED TO FARMS WHICH MAINTAINED THEIR CATTLE. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE PATTERNS OF CATTLE MOVEMENT AND SIZE OF ANIMAL MOVED BETWEEN FARMS CONTRIBUTED TO THE POTENTIAL FOR BTB TRANSMISSION. THE FEW FARMS WITH THE BULK OF TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL COULD BE EFFICIENTLY TARGETED BY CONTROL MEASURES AIMED AT REDUCING THE SPREAD OF BTB. THE NETWORK STRUCTURE DESCRIBED CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE STARTING POINT TO BUILD AND ESTIMATE DYNAMIC TRANSMISSION MODELS FOR BTB, AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.","10.1186/S12917-019-1962-1","1746-6148 (ELECTRONIC) 1746-6148 (LINKING)","BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH","262","NETWORK ANALYSIS OF DAIRY CATTLE MOVEMENT AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS SPREAD AND CONTROL IN EMERGING DAIRY BELTS OF ETHIOPIA","15",2019,"ISI","BMC VET RES",0,"none","NATIONAL ANIMAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC AND INVESTIGATION CENTER, P.; O.; BOX 04, SEBETA, ETHIOPIA.; GETNET.;ABIE.;MEKONNEN@GMAIL.;COM.; AKLILU LEMMA INSTITUTE OF PATHOBIOLOGY, ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY, P.; O.; BOX 1176, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.; GETNET.;ABIE.;MEKONNEN@GMAIL.;COM.; AKLILU LEMMA INSTITUTE OF PATHOBIOLOGY, ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY, P.; O.; BOX 1176, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.; DISEASE DYNAMICS UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, MADINGLEY ROAD, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0ES, UK.; BACTERIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH AGENCY, SURREY, KT15 3NB, UK.; DISEASE DYNAMICS UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, MADINGLEY ROAD, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0ES, UK.;","NATIONAL ANIMAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC AND INVESTIGATION CENTER;ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY;ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH AGENCY;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE","MEKONNEN GA, 2019, BMC VET RES","MEKONNEN GA, 2019, BMC VET RES"

WHEN SUCH DISASTERS OCCUR, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH KOREA AND ITS AFFILIATED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-TOGETHER WITH NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS-PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CORROBORATE THE CHARACTERISTICS GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS EXHIBIT THROUGH THEIR INTERCONNECTION WHEN THE PARTIES ARE UNDERGOING A DISEASE-RELATED CATASTROPHE SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: USING THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE, THE SPAN OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WAS SEGMENTED INTO 3 TIME FRAMES, AND THE RELATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COVID-19 CONTAGIOUS DISEASE RESPONSE DEPARTMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES AT HOME AND ABROAD WERE ANALYZED BASED ON 3 CENTRALITIES. RESULTS: EVIDENCE FROM THE SECOND AND THIRD TIME FRAMES INDICATES THAT THE AGENTS REACTING TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASES DO NOT NECESSARILY HOLD THE CENTRAL POSITION IN THE NETWORK.

METHODS: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH BASELINE AND 6-MONTH ASSESSMENTS FOR THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AMONG APPALACHIAN PEOPLE STUDY (2008-2011). INTERVIEWER-ADMINISTERED SURVEYS COLLECTED SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND DRUG USE BEHAVIORS (PAST 6 MONTHS AND LIFETIME). PARTICIPANTS ALSO LISTED SEX, DRUG USE, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT PARTNERS (PAST 6 MONTHS). LISTED NAMES WERE CROSS-REFERENCED WITH SURVEY PARTICIPANTS TO IDENTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE ANALYTIC SAMPLE WAS FURTHER RESTRICTED TO INCLUDE ONLY THOSE RELATIONSHIP PAIRS WHERE BOTH INDIVIDUALS REPORTED A HISTORY OF INJECTION DRUG USE AT BASELINE (N = 244 UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS AND 746 DYADS). WE FIT A GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL TO (1) ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEER INJECTION CESSATION AND INDIVIDUAL INJECTION CESSATION AND (2) DETERMINE WHETHER THE STRENGTH OF THIS ASSOCIATION DIFFERS BY RELATIONSHIP-LEVEL VARIABLES (I.E., RELATIONSHIP ROLE, RELATIONSHIP TYPE, RELATIONSHIP DURATION, FREQUENCY OF INTERACTION, RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY). RESULTS: OVERALL, THOSE WITH A NETWORK MEMBER WHO CEASED INJECTION DRUG USE WERE MORE LIKELY TO STOP INJECTING OVER THE FOLLOWING 6-MONTH PERIOD (AOR=1.65). THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS ASSOCIATION WAS GREATER FOR SOCIAL SUPPORT PARTNERS (AOR=2.95), FAMILY MEMBERS (AOR=3.56), THOSE WITH WHOM THE PARTICIPANT INTERACTED AT LEAST DAILY (AOR=2.17), AND THOSE WHO THE PARTICIPANT KNEW LONGER (AOR=2.09). FURTHER, AMONG FAMILY MEMBERS, THE EFFECT SIZE WAS GREATER WHEN RELATIONSHIPS WERE FURTHER RESTRICTED TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS (AOR=5.35). CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IN THIS RURAL COMMUNITY, CLOSER, MORE SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS, MAY BE MORE INFLUENTIAL FOR MODELING INJECTION CESSATION; HOWEVER, RELATIONSHIP-TYPES WERE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SO DIFFERENCES IN EFFECT SIZE ACROSS STRATA MAY NOT BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN THIS SETTING, SOCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH THE RECOVERY PROCESS (INCLUDING CESSATION ATTEMPTS WITH PEERS) MAY INCREASE LIKELIHOOD OF INJECTION CESSATION.","S0955-3959(19)30311-1","1873-4758 (ELECTRONIC) 0955-3959 (PRINT) 0955-3959 (LINKING)","THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DRUG POLICY","102604","PEER INFLUENCE OF INJECTION DRUG USE CESSATION AMONG DYADS IN RURAL EASTERN KENTUCKY","85",2020,"ISI","INT J DRUG POLICY",0,"none","DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, PHILADELPHIA, PA, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: ABBY.;RUDOLPH@TEMPLE.;EDU.; DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, BOSTON UNIVERSITY, BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, WILLIAMS COLLEGE, WILLIAMSTOWN, MA, UNITED STATES.; CENTER ON DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH, DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, LEXINGTON, KY, UNITED STATES.; DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, LEXINGTON, KY, UNITED STATES; CENTER ON DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH, DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, LEXINGTON, KY, UNITED STATES; CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY TRANSFORMATION, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KY, UNITED STATES.; CENTER ON DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH, DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, LEXINGTON, KY, UNITED STATES.;","TEMPLE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH;ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: ABBY.;BOSTON UNIVERSITY;WILLIAMS COLLEGE;UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH;UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY;UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","RUDOLPH AE, 2020, INT J DRUG POLICY","RUDOLPH AE, 2020, INT J DRUG POLICY"

METHODS: A MATHEMATICAL MODEL WITH A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) APPROACH WAS USED TO SIMULATE A COVID-19 OUTBREAK. A DISCRETE-TIME STOCHASTIC SIMULATION MODEL WAS USED TO SIMULATE THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 WITHIN THE SARANG JEIL CHURCH. A COUNTERFACTUAL EXPERIMENT USING A CALIBRATED BASELINE MODEL WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF COMPLYING WITH A MASK-WEARING POLICY. RESULTS: SIMULATIONS ESTIMATED A MASK-WEARING RATIO OF 67% AT THE TIME OF THE OUTBREAK, WHICH YIELDED 953.8 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 937.3 TO 970.4) CASES AND WAS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE CONFIRMED DATA. THE COUNTERFACTUAL EXPERIMENT WITH 95% MASK-WEARING ESTIMATED AN AVERAGE OF 45.6 (95% CI, 43.4 TO 47.9) CASES WITH A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 20.1. THE RESULT INDICATED THAT IF THE CHURCH FOLLOWED GOVERNMENT MASK-WEARING GUIDELINES PROPERLY, THE OUTBREAK MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE-TWENTIETH THE SIZE. CONCLUSIONS: SNA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MONITORING AND CONTROLLING OUTBREAKS OF COVID-19 AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. ALTHOUGH OUR RESULTS ARE BASED ON SIMULATIONS AND ARE THUS LIMITED, THE PRECAUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MASK-WEARING ARE STILL RELEVANT.

THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION REGULATING TOBACCO USE IN PUBLIC SPACES VARIES ACROSS COUNTRIES, IMPACTING THE TOBACCO CONTROL CONTEXT. THUS REVIEWING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW SOCIAL NETWORKS MAY INFLUENCE SMOKING DIFFERENTLY WITHIN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS IS REQUIRED TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEXT-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS. METHODS: THE SEARCH, CONDUCTED ON 31ST MAY 2019, INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING SMOKING-RELATED TERMS; SCHOOLS, ADOLESCENTS, PEERS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT SCREENING AND FULL TEXT SCREENING. QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND SYNTHESIS FOLLOWED. STUDIES WERE NARRATIVELY SYNTHESISED TO IDENTIFY CHANGES ACCORDING TO LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT. THIS SYNTHESIS WAS CONDUCTED SEPARATELY FOR FINDINGS RELATING TO THREE CATEGORIES: SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS; SOCIAL SELECTION AND INFLUENCE; AND NETWORK POSITION. RESULTS: THIRTY STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS AND SMOKING ACCORDING TO SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS WERE MEASURED IN FIVE OUT OF FIFTEEN STUDIES IN EUROPE. RESULTS VARIED ACROSS STUDIES, WITH DIFFERENCES IN NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH SMOKING VARYING BOTH BETWEEN SCHOOLS OF A DIFFERING AND THOSE OF A SIMILAR SOCIOECONOMIC COMPOSITION. FOR STUDIES CONDUCTED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPREHENSIVE SMOKING LEGISLATION, THE EVIDENCE FOR SELECTION PROCESSES WAS MORE CONSISTENT THAN INFLUENCE, WHICH VARIED ACCORDING TO RECIPROCITY. FINDINGS SHOWED THAT ISOLATES WERE MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE AND IN-DEGREE AND OUT-DEGREE CENTRALITY WERE RELATED TO SMOKING BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULARITY AND SMOKING WAS CONTINGENT ON SCHOOL LEVEL SMOKING PREVALENCE IN STUDIES CONDUCTED BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION, BUT NOT AFTER.

LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CARE FRAGMENTATION AND TOTAL SPENDING, AND WHETHER THIS RELATIONSHIP IS MEDIATED BY INFECTIONS. METHODS: TOTAL PAYMENTS WERE CAPTURED FROM ADMISSION TO 180 DAYS POST-DISCHARGE. DRAWING ON NETWORK THEORY, A MEASURE OF CARE FRAGMENTATION WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARED PATIENTS AMONG PROVIDERS (IE, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS, CARDIAC SURGEONS, CARDIOLOGISTS, CRITICAL CARE SPECIALISTS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS) CARING FOR 4,987 MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES UNDERGOING LVAD IMPLANTATION BETWEEN JULY 2009 - APRIL 2017. CARE FRAGMENTATION WAS MEASURED USING AVERAGE PATH LENGTH, WHICH DESCRIBES HOW EFFICIENTLY INFORMATION FLOWS AMONG NETWORK MEMBERS; LONGER PATH LENGTH INDICATES GREATER FRAGMENTATION. TERCILES BASED ON THE LEVEL OF CARE FRAGMENTATION AND MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CARE FRAGMENTATION AND LVAD PAYMENTS AND MEDIATION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF POST-IMPLANT INFECTIONS. RESULTS: THE PATIENT COHORT WAS 81% MALE, 73% WHITE, 11% INTERMACS PROFILE 1 WITH MEAN (SD) AGE OF 63.1 YEARS (11.1). THE MEAN (SD) LEVEL OF CARE FRAGMENTATION IN PROVIDER NETWORKS WAS 1.7 (0.2) AND MEAN (SD) PAYMENT FROM ADMISSION TO 180 DAYS POST-DISCHARGE WAS $246,905 ($109,872). MEAN (SD) TOTAL PAYMENTS AT THE LOWER, MIDDLE, AND UPPER TERCILES OF CARE FRAGMENTATION WERE $250,135 ($111,924), $243,288 ($109,376), AND $247,290 ($108,241), RESPECTIVELY. IN MEDIATION ANALYSIS, THE INDIRECT EFFECT OF CARE FRAGMENTATION ON TOTAL PAYMENTS, THROUGH INFECTIONS, WAS POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (Β=16032.5, P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: GREATER CARE FRAGMENTATION IN THE DELIVERY OF CARE SURROUNDING DURABLE LVAD IMPLANTATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF INFECTIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, HIGHER PAYMENTS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

ANTI-VACCINE POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAY BE FACILITATING ANTI-VACCINATION BEHAVIOUR. THIS STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE (1) INDIVIDUALS KNOWN TO PUBLICLY POST ANTI-VACCINATION CONTENT ON FACEBOOK, (2) THE INFORMATION THEY CONVEY, AND (3) THE SPREAD OF THIS CONTENT. METHODS: OUR DATA SET CONSISTED OF 197 INDIVIDUALS WHO POSTED ANTI-VACCINATION COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO A MESSAGE PROMOTING VACCINATION. WE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYSED PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE CONTENT USING QUANTITATIVE CODING, DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND AN IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT. THE FINAL CODEBOOK CONSISTED OF 26 CODES; COHEN'S Κ RANGED 0.71-1.0 AFTER DOUBLE-CODING. RESULTS: THE MAJORITY (89%) OF INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS FEMALE.

HERE, WE ANALYZE MULTIMODAL COVID-19-ASSOCIATED DATA COLLECTED DURING THE 2020-2021 ACADEMIC YEAR AT COLORADO MESA UNIVERSITY AND INTRODUCE A SARS-COV-2 SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE FRAMEWORK. METHODS: WE ANALYZED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND SOCIOBEHAVIORAL DATA (DEMOGRAPHICS, CONTACT TRACING, AND WIFI-BASED CO-LOCATION DATA) ALONGSIDE PATHOGEN SURVEILLANCE DATA (WASTEWATER AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, AND VIRAL GENOMIC SEQUENCING OF WASTEWATER AND CLINICAL SPECIMENS) TO CHARACTERIZE OUTBREAK DYNAMICS AND INFORM POLICY. WE APPLIED RELATIVE RISK, MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION, AND SOCIAL NETWORK ASSORTATIVITY TO IDENTIFY ATTRIBUTES OR BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTRACTING SARS-COV-2. TO CHARACTERIZE SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION, WE USED VIRAL SEQUENCING, PHYLOGENOMIC TOOLS, AND FUNCTIONAL ASSAYS. FINDINGS: ATHLETES, PARTICULARLY THOSE ON HIGH-CONTACT TEAMS, HAD THE HIGHEST RISK OF TESTING POSITIVE. ON AVERAGE, INDIVIDUALS WHO TESTED POSITIVE HAD MORE CONTACTS AND LONGER INTERACTION DURATIONS THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO NEVER TESTED POSITIVE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONTACTS PER INDIVIDUAL WAS OVERDISPERSED, ALTHOUGH NOT AS OVERDISPERSED AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYLOGENOMIC DESCENDANTS.

SPECIFICALLY, THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS ON DISEASE OUTBREAKS AMONG WILDLIFE POPULATIONS IN URBAN AND PERI-URBAN ENVIRONMENTS REMAIN UNCLEAR. WE USED SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SUSCEPTIBLE-INFECTED-RECOVERED MODELS TO SIMULATE ZOOANTHROPONOTIC OUTBREAKS, THROUGH WILD ANIMALS' JOINT PROPENSITIES TO CO-INTERACT WITH HUMANS, AND THEIR SOCIAL GROOMING OF CONSPECIFICS. ON 10 GROUPS OF MACAQUES (MACACA SPP.) IN PERI-URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN ASIA, WE COLLECTED BEHAVIORAL DATA USING EVENT SAMPLING OF HUMAN-MACAQUE INTERACTIONS WITHIN THE SAME TIME AND SPACE, AND FOCAL SAMPLING OF MACAQUES' SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH CONSPECIFICS AND OVERALL ANTHROPOGENIC EXPOSURE. MODEL-PREDICTED OUTBREAK SIZES WERE RELATED TO STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF MACAQUES' NETWORKS. FOR ALL THREE SPECIES, AND FOR BOTH ANTHROPOGENIC (CO-INTERACTIONS) AND SOCIAL (GROOMING) CONTEXTS, OUTBREAK SIZES WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO THE NETWORK CENTRALITY OF FIRST-INFECTED MACAQUES. ACROSS HOST SPECIES AND CONTEXTS, THE ABOVE EFFECTS WERE STRONGER THROUGH MACAQUES' HUMAN CO-INTERACTION NETWORKS THAN THROUGH THEIR GROOMING NETWORKS, PARTICULARLY FOR RHESUS AND BONNET MACAQUES. LONG-TAILED MACAQUES APPEARED TO SHOW INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN THESE EFFECTS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AMONG WILDLIFE IN ANTHROPOGENICALLY-IMPACTED ENVIRONMENTS, THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR AGGREGATIONS AROUND ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS MAKES THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO ZOOANTHROPONOTIC OUTBREAKS THAN THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURE. THE GLOBAL FEATURES OF THESE NETWORKS THAT INFLUENCE DISEASE OUTBREAKS, AND THEIR UNDERLYING SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL COVARIATES, NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF RISK-LOWERING PRACTICES IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING, THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AMONG HEALTH CARE WORKERS. FAST AND EFFICIENT CONTACT TRACING AND SARS-COV-2 PCR-BASED TESTING OF THE CLOSE CONTACTS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS WITH CONFIRMED INFECTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL STEPS TO LIMIT NOSOCOMIAL OUTBREAKS. METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT BARI POLICLINICO GENERAL UNIVERSITY-HOSPITAL (APULIA, ITALY) AND DESCRIBES THE MANAGEMENT OF A CLUSTER OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS IN THREE OPERATIVE UNITS. THE CONTACT TRACING ACTIVITIES AND THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED TO CONTROL THE OUTBREAK ARE DESCRIBED. RESULTS: AMONG THE 186 HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACTIVE IN THE CLUSTER SETTING, THERE WERE 9 (4.8%) CONFIRMED CASES, INCLUDING THE INDEX CASE. DUE TO THE OUTBREAK, THREE OPERATIVE UNITS WERE CLOSED TO LIMIT VIRUS CIRCULATION. HEALTH CARE WORKERS WITH CONFIRMED INFECTIONS TESTED NEGATIVE AFTER A MEAN OF 28.0±6.6 DAYS (RANGE: 13-37) AND NONE REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. CONCLUSIONS: PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SHOULD BE A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. HOWEVER, DESPITE RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES, SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS REMAIN AT A HIGH RATE, INDICATIVE OF THE CONTINUED HIGH RISK OF CLUSTER ONSET IN THE NOSOCOMIAL SETTING.","10.7416/AI.2022.2519","1120-9135 (PRINT) 1120-9135 (LINKING)","ANNALI DI IGIENE : MEDICINA PREVENTIVA E DI COMUNITA","39-48","A COVID19 NOSOCOMIAL CLUSTER IN A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN ITALY A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS","35",2023,"ISI","ANN IG",0,"none","DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE AND HUMAN ONCOLOGY, ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI, BARI, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE AND HUMAN ONCOLOGY, ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI, BARI, ITALY.; HOSPITAL DIRECTION, BARI POLICLINICO GENERAL HOSPITAL, BARI, ITALY.; HOSPITAL DIRECTION, BARI POLICLINICO GENERAL HOSPITAL, BARI, ITALY.; HOSPITAL DIRECTION, BARI POLICLINICO GENERAL HOSPITAL, BARI, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY MEDICINE, ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI, BARI, ITALY.; HOSPITAL DIRECTION, BARI POLICLINICO GENERAL HOSPITAL, BARI, ITALY.; CR WORKING GROUP: FABIO AMORUSO, LUCA CAPODIFERRO, GLORIA MANNARINI, ANDREA MARTINELLI, GIULIA MASSARI, DONATO RUSSO, VALERIO SBLENDORIO, GIUSEPPE SPINELLI, STEFANIA SPONSELLI, EDOARDO MARIA TERLIZZI, MONICA TOTA.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE AND HUMAN ONCOLOGY, ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI, BARI, ITALY.;","ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI;ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI;HOSPITAL DIRECTION;HOSPITAL DIRECTION;HOSPITAL DIRECTION;ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI;HOSPITAL DIRECTION;ALDO MORO UNIVERSITY OF BARI","BIANCHI FP, 2023, ANN IG","BIANCHI FP, 2023, ANN IG"

OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CAPABILITY OF DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS FOR IMMUNIZATION IS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL FOR THE CONTAINMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS WITHIN A SMALL NETWORK. FINALLY, OUR PROPOSED METHODOLOGY NOT ONLY DETERMINES THE OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS FOR TARGET IMMUNIZATION, BUT CAN ALSO AID POLICYMAKERS IN DETERMINING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE.","10.1186/S12911-020-01281-0","1472-6947 (ELECTRONIC) 1472-6947 (LINKING)","BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING","266","OUTBREAK MINIMIZATION VS INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION AN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK","20",2020,"ISI","BMC MED INFORM DECIS MAK",0,"none","LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MULTITECH R&D CENTRE LIMITED, UNIT 202, LEVEL 2, BLOCK B, CYBERPORT 4, 100 CYBERPORT ROAD, HONG KONG, HONG KONG, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, POKFULAM ROAD, HONG KONG, CHINA.; YHKUO@HKU.;HK.; DEPARTMENT OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, THE CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, SHATIN, NEW TERRITORIES, HONG KONG, CHINA.;","LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MULTITECH RANDD CENTRE LIMITED;THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;THE CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG","CHENG CH, 2020, BMC MED INFORM DECIS MAK","CHENG CH, 2020, BMC MED INFORM DECIS MAK"

EVER SINCE, SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDUCTED RESEARCH, SEROLOGICAL SURVEYS, AND SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES TO DETECT THE VIRUS IN HORSES, BIRDS, MOSQUITOES, AND HUMANS. ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN CARRIED THEM OUT INDEPENDENTLY, LEADING TO KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITHIN THE CURRENT VIRUS' SITUATION. NEARLY 20 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF WEST NILE VIRUS IN THE ARCHIPELAGO, IT HAS NOT YET BEEN ISOLATED, ITS IMPACT ON HUMAN AND ANIMAL POPULATIONS IS UNKNOWN, AND ITS LOCAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CYCLE IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A PILOT PROJECT STARTED IN GUADELOUPE IN 2019, WEST NILE VIRUS WAS CHOSEN AS A FEDERATIVE MODEL TO APPLY THE ""ONE HEALTH"" APPROACH FOR ZOONOTIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE AND SHIFT FROM A SECTORIAL TO AN INTEGRATED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. HUMAN, ANIMAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTORS INVOLVED IN BOTH RESEARCH AND SURVEILLANCE WERE CONSIDERED. SEMI-DIRECTED INTERVIEWS AND A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WERE CARRIED OUT TO LEARN ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE NETWORK STRUCTURE AND ACTORS, ANALYZE INFORMATION FLOWS, AND IDENTIFY COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES. AN INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED TO FILL MAJOR GAPS: USERS' NEEDS AND MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES WERE DEFINED THROUGH A PARTICIPATORY PROCESS WHERE ACTORS ALSO TESTED AND VALIDATED THE TOOL. ADDITIONALLY, ALL ACTORS SHARED THEIR DATA, WHICH WERE DIGITIZED, CATALOGED, AND CENTRALIZED, TO BE ANALYZED LATER. AN R SHINY SERVER WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE INFORMATION SYSTEM, ALLOWING AN ACCESSIBLE AND DYNAMIC DISPLAY OF DATA SHOWCASING ALL OF THE PARTNERS' INFORMATION. FINALLY, A SERIES OF VIRTUAL WORKSHOPS WERE ORGANIZED AMONG ACTORS TO DISCUSS PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND PLAN THE NEXT STEPS TO IMPROVE WEST NILE VIRUS AND VECTOR-BORNE OR EMERGING ZOONOSIS SURVEILLANCE. THE ACTORS ARE WILLING TO BUILD A MORE RESILIENT AND COOPERATIVE NETWORK IN GUADELOUPE WITH IMPROVED RELEVANCE, EFFICIENCY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR WORK.","10.3389/FPUBH.2021.649190","2296-2565 (ELECTRONIC) 2296-2565 (LINKING)","FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH","649190","SHIFTING FROM SECTORAL TO INTEGRATED SURVEILLANCE BY CHANGING COLLABORATIVE PRACTICES APPLICATION TO WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE IN A SMALL ISLAND STATE OF THE CARIBBEAN","9",2021,"ISI","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH",0,"none","CIRAD, UMR, ASTRE, PETIT-BOURG, FRANCE.; ASTRE, CIRAD, INRAE.; UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.; ASTRE, CIRAD, INRAE.; UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.; ASTRE, CIRAD, INRAE.; UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.; CIRAD, UMR, ASTRE, PETIT-BOURG, FRANCE.; ASTRE, CIRAD, INRAE.; UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.; CIRE ANTILLES, SANTÉ PUBLIQUE FRANCE, POINTE-À-PITRE, FRANCE.; CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE, DEPARTMENT OF BACTERIOLOGY, VIROLOGY AND PARASITOLOGY, POINTE-À-PITRE, FRANCE.; INSTITUT PASTEUR DE GUADELOUPE, LABORATORY OF VECTOR CONTROL RESEARCH, UNIT TRANSMISSION, RESERVOIRS AND PATHOGEN DIVERSITY, LES ABYMES, FRANCE.; ANSES, LABORATORY FOR ANIMAL HEALTH, UMR1161 VIROLOGY, INRAE, ANSES, ENVA, MAISONS-ALFORT, FRANCE.; CIRAD, UMR, ASTRE, PETIT-BOURG, FRANCE.; ASTRE, CIRAD, INRAE.; UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;","UNIV MONTPELLIER;UNIV MONTPELLIER;UNIV MONTPELLIER;UNIV MONTPELLIER;CENTRE HOSPITALIER UNIVERSITAIRE;INSTITUT PASTEUR DE GUADELOUPE;LABORATORY FOR ANIMAL HEALTH;UNIV MONTPELLIER","GEFFROY M, 2021, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","GEFFROY M, 2021, FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH"

OBJECTIVES: BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS THEORY WILL BE UTILIZED TO UNDERSTAND HOW SEXUAL HEALTH COMMUNICATION (SHC) INFLUENCES SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS OF HBC-MSM. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ADVANCE THIS GOAL BY DESCRIBING CHARACTERISTICS OF SHC EMBEDDED WITHIN SOCIAL AND SEXUAL NETWORKS, AND IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF SHC ON SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AMONG A SAMPLE OF BLACK AND LATINO HBC-MSM. METHODS: THIS STUDY ENTAILS CROSS-SECTIONAL QUANTITATIVE SURVEY DESIGN WITH INTERNET-BASED DATA COLLECTION TO TEST A THEORY-DRIVEN MODEL OF THE EFFECTS OF AUTONOMY SUPPORTIVE COMMUNICATION ON SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS. RESPONDENT-DRIVEN SAMPLING (RDS) AND INTERNET DRIVEN SAMPLING (ID) WILL BE USED TO RECRUIT A SAMPLE OF 200 HBC-MSM. WE WILL UTILIZE EGOCENTRIC NETWORK ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE (A) THE HBC-SPECIFIC SOCIAL AND/OR SEXUAL NETWORK MEMBERS WHO PROVIDE SHC; (B) THE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY NETWORK MEMBERS, AND (C) THE SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS CHARACTERIZING THE SAMPLE OF HBC-MSM. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM) WILL BE PERFORMED TO TEST ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AUTONOMY SUPPORTIVE SEXUAL HEALTH COMMUNICATION (INDEPENDENT VARIABLE) AND SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS (OUTCOME), WITH NEEDS SATISFACTION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AS INTERVENING MEDIATORS. DISCUSSION: SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS NECESSARY TO EXPAND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SHC IMPACTS SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS FOR HBC-MSM. THE STUDY PROVIDES AN CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SEXUAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND MOTIVATIONS AS PARTICIPANTS OPERATE IN HBC.

THE LACK OF A SUSTAINABLE POULTRY DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM COUPLED WITH COMMUNITIES AND PRACTICES WHERE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BIRDS ARE HIGH, EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR TARGETED SURVEILLANCE OF CHICKEN DISEASES IN THE PROVINCE. HOWEVER, TO SET UP SUCH A SYSTEM REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF THE VALUE CHAIN AND TRADE NETWORKS. CONSEQUENTLY, A SURVEY, WHICH INVOLVED A RURAL CHICKEN VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS THAT ALSO INCLUDED AN ASSESSMENT OF TRADING PRACTICES TO IDENTIFY BIOSECURITY HOTSPOTS AND AN IDENTIFICATION OF BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY FOR RURAL FARMERS WAS CONDUCTED. SECONDLY, A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF CHICKEN MOVEMENTS IN THE PROVINCE WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY TRADE HUBS THAT COULD BE TARGETED FOR DISEASE SURVEILLANCE BASED ON THEIR CENTRALITY WITHIN THE NETWORK AND THEIR SIZE AND INFLUENCE WITHIN THEIR EGO NETWORKS. TRADERS AND THEIR TRANSPORT VEHICLES WERE IDENTIFIED AS BIOSECURITY HOTSPOTS THAT COULD BE TARGETED FOR DISEASE SURVEILLANCE WITHIN THE CHAIN. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THREE MUNICIPALITIES VIZ. UMZIMVUBU, KING SABATA DALINDYEBO (KSD) AND ENOCH MGIJIMA AS TRADE HUBS WHERE INTERACTION BETWEEN RURAL CHICKENS OCCURS AND RESOURCES CAN BE FOCUSED. THE MOVEMENT OF SPENT HENS FROM COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS THAT ARE TRANSPORTED OVER LONG DISTANCES AND DISTRIBUTED IN THE RURAL AREAS AND TOWNSHIPS WERE A MAJOR RISK FOR SPREAD OF POULTRY DISEASES. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO FORMALLY DESCRIBE CHICKEN TRADE NETWORKS WITHIN THE PROVINCE AND THE SURROUNDING REGION. ITS FINDINGS PROVIDE A MODEL FOR COST EFFECTIVE TARGETED SURVEILLANCE IN THE ECP AND SIMILAR RESOURCE POOR REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THE STUDY ALSO PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE PROFITABILITY OF RURAL CHICKENS AND A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO JOB CREATION AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION ONCE THE BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY ARE LIFTED.","S0167-5877(22)00146-5","1873-1716 (ELECTRONIC) 0167-5877 (LINKING)","PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE","105713","USING VALUE CHAIN AND TRADE NETWORKS IN THE EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE OF SOUTH AFRICA AS A BASIS FOR TARGETED RURAL CHICKEN SURVEILLANCE","207",2022,"ISI","PREV VET MED",0,"none","STATE VETERINARY SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND AGRARIAN REFORM, LADY FRERE 5410, SOUTH AFRICA; DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTION ANIMAL STUDIES, FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, ONDERSTEPOORT 0110, SOUTH AFRICA; COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MEDICAL AND VETERINARY SCIENCES, JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY, TOWNSVILLE 4811, AUSTRALIA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: U28077629@TUKS.;CO.;ZA.; DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTION ANIMAL STUDIES, FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, ONDERSTEPOORT 0110, SOUTH AFRICA.; SCHOOL OF ANIMAL & VETERINARY SCIENCES AND GRAHAM CENTRE FOR AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION, CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY, WAGGA WAGGA, 2650, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY SERVICES, MINISTRY OF LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES, LUSAKA 50060, ZAMBIA.; DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTION ANIMAL STUDIES, FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, ONDERSTEPOORT 0110, SOUTH AFRICA.; DEPARTMENT OF PRODUCTION ANIMAL STUDIES, FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, ONDERSTEPOORT 0110, SOUTH AFRICA; COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MEDICAL AND VETERINARY SCIENCES, JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY, TOWNSVILLE 4811, AUSTRALIA.;","UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY","SIMBIZI V, 2022, PREV VET MED","SIMBIZI V, 2022, PREV VET MED"

WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLVING IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON ETHNOCULTURAL COMMUNITIES TO INFORM INTERSECTORAL ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY ACTION. METHODS: THE ILLUMINATE PROJECT USED PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH, WITH CULTURAL HEALTH BROKERS AS PEER RESEARCHERS, FROM SEPT. 21 TO DEC. 31, 2020, IN EDMONTON, ALBERTA. TWENTY-ONE PEER RESEARCHERS COLLECTED NARRATIVES FROM MEMBERS OF ETHNOCULTURAL COMMUNITIES AND SELF-INTERPRETED THEM AS THEY ENTERED THE NARRATIVES INTO THE SENSEMAKER PLATFORM, A MIXED-METHOD DATA COLLECTION TOOL. THE ENTIRE RESEARCH TEAM ANALYZED REAL-TIME, AGGREGATE, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA TO IDENTIFY EMERGING THEMATIC DOMAINS, THEN VISUALIZED THESE DOMAINS WITH SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. RESULTS: BROKERS SERVING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES COLLECTED 773 NARRATIVES. IDENTIFIED DOMAINS ILLUMINATE THE EVOLVING AND ENTANGLED IMPACTS OF COVID-19 INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: COVID-19 PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT; CARE OF ACUTE, CHRONIC AND SERIOUS ILLNESSES OTHER THAN COVID-19; MATERNAL CARE; MENTAL HEALTH AND TRIGGERS OF PAST TRAUMA; FINANCIAL INSECURITY; IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND SENIORS; AND LEGAL CONCERNS. WE IDENTIFIED THAT COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL AND CULTURAL BROKERING ARE KEY ASSETS THAT FACILITATE ACCESS TO FORMAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SYSTEM SUPPORTS. INTERPRETATION: THE ILLUMINATE PROJECT HAS ILLUSTRATED THE ENTANGLED, SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT RESULT IN POOR HEALTH AMONG VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF ETHNOCULTURAL COMMUNITIES, AND THE EXACERBATING EFFECTS OF COVID-19, WHICH ALSO INCREASED BARRIERS TO MITIGATION. CULTURAL BROKERING AND COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL ARE KEY SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO VALIDATE THE BRIEF ALCOHOL SOCIAL DENSITY ASSESSMENT (BASDA), AN EFFICIENT MEASURE OF PERCEIVED ALCOHOL USE WITHIN A PERSON'S SOCIAL NETWORK, IN A SAMPLE OF ADULT DRINKERS FROM THE GENERAL COMMUNITY. SPECIFICALLY, THE CONVERGENT, CRITERION-RELATED, INCREMENTAL VALIDITY AND INTERNAL VALIDITY WERE INVESTIGATED BY EXAMINING THE BASDA IN RELATION TO OTHER ESTABLISHED MEASURES OF DRINKING MOTIVES, WEEKLY DRINKING LEVEL, AND SEVERITY OF INVOLVEMENT. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 903 (56% FEMALE) ADULTS WHO REPORTED DRINKING IN THE LAST YEAR AND WHO COMPLETED THE BASDA, THE DRINKING MOTIVES QUESTIONNAIRE, THE DAILY DRINKING QUESTIONNAIRE, AND THE ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST (AUDIT). RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE BASDA AND DRINKING MOTIVES, DRINKING QUANTITY, AND THE AUDIT (RS = 0.21 TO 0.51, PS < 0.001), PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR CONVERGENT VALIDITY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BASDA SCORE FOR THOSE SCORING AT OR ABOVE AN AUDIT CUTOFF FOR HAZARDOUS DRINKING (P < 0.001), PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR CRITERION-RELATED VALIDITY. FINALLY, BEYOND MOTIVES AND COVARIATES, THE BASDA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH TOTAL AUDIT SCORE (ΔR(2)  = 0.09, P < 0.001), INDICATING ITS ADDITIVE CONTRIBUTION AND PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR INCREMENTAL VALIDITY. CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS REVEALED EXCELLENT FIT, AND ALL ITEMS SIGNIFICANTLY LOADED ONTO A SINGLE FACTOR (P < 0.0001), PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL VALIDITY. THE RESULTING ALCOHOL SOCIAL DENSITY LATENT VARIABLE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND ROBUSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DRINKS PER WEEK AND AUDIT TOTAL SCORE.

THIS STUDY CONSTRUCTS AN INTEGRATED MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCING MECHANISMS OF INTERNAL LOCUS OF CONTROL (LOC) AND OBJECTIVE PEER EFFECTS. METHODS: RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS (N = 494) WERE SURVEYED FROM A SINGLE DEPARTMENT OF A CHINESE UNIVERSITY. AN ITEM FROM THE WORLD VALUE SURVEY WAS EMPLOYED TO MEASURE INTERNAL LOC, WHILE OBJECTIVE PEER EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED VIA FRIENDS' MUTUAL NOMINATIONS. FINALLY, PIU WAS MEASURED USING YOUNG'S INTERNET ADDICTION TESTS, WHILE A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND LOGIT REGRESSION WERE COMBINED TO ESTIMATE VARIOUS FACTORS' EFFECTS ON PIU. RESULTS: IN OUR SAMPLE, THE PREVALENCE RATE OF PIU WAS 30.6%, AND WHILE INTERNAL LOC WAS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR FOR PIU, ITS PROTECTIVE ROLE WAS DILUTED WHEN EXPOSED TO A PEER ENVIRONMENT WITH HIGH PIU PREVALENCE. FURTHERMORE, INDEGREE PERFORMED CONTRASTING ROLES ON PIU UNDER VARIOUS NETWORK CONDITIONS. IT ACTED AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR WHEN EXPOSED TO A LOW PREVALENCE OF PIU IN A PEER ENVIRONMENT; HOWEVER, IT BECAME A RISK FACTOR WHEN PIU PEERS WERE PREVALENT.

THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE COEVOLUTION OF SOCIOMETRIC POPULARITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AMONG ADOLESCENTS SUFFERING FROM THE STRESS ATTACHED TO THE CHINESE GAOKAO. METHODS: THE ANALYTICAL SAMPLE COMPRISED 1062 CHINESE ADOLESCENTS WHO WERE UNDER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR (RETURNEES) TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. STUDENTS WERE ASSESSED FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND ASKED TO NOMINATE UP TO FIVE FRIENDS WITHIN THEIR CLASSES ACROSS FOUR WAVES (SIX MONTHS). WE EMPLOYED STOCHASTIC ACTOR-ORIENTED MODELS TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POPULARITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. RESULTS: ADOLESCENTS' DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS NEGATIVELY PREDICTED FUTURE FRIENDSHIP POPULARITY IN THIS STRESSFUL SITUATION, BUT NOT VICE VERSA. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDS' POPULARITY, INDICATING THAT ADOLESCENTS WHO NOMINATED POPULAR PEERS AS FRIENDS TENDED TO SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LOWER DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT FRIENDS' POPULARITY MAY SERVE AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR AGAINST DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS UNDER MAJOR CHRONIC STRESS.

AIM: TO IDENTIFY THE SUPER-FACTORS CAUSING COVID-19 INFECTION IN MEDICAL STAFF IN CHINA. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1(ST) AND FEBRUARY 30(TH), 2020, IN WHICH FRONT-LINE MEMBERS OF MEDICAL STAFF WHO TOOK PART IN THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 WERE ENROLLED. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BETWEEN INFECTED AND UNINFECTED GROUPS WERE COLLECTED AND COMPARED. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) WAS USED TO ESTABLISH SOCIO-METRIC SOCIAL LINKS BETWEEN INFLUENCING FACTORS. FINDINGS: A TOTAL OF 92 MEDICAL STAFF WERE ENROLLED. IN ALL PARTICIPANT GROUPS, THE SUPER-FACTOR IDENTIFIED BY THE NETWORK WAS WEARING A MEDICAL PROTECTIVE MASK OR SURGICAL MASK CORRECTLY (DEGREE: 572; CLOSENESS: 25; BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY: 3.23). TOUCHING THE CHEEK, NOSE, AND MOUTH WHILE WORKING WAS THE SUPER-FACTOR IN THE INFECTED GROUP. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST NODE IN THE NETWORK AND HAD THE STRONGEST INFLUENCE (DEGREE: 370; CLOSENESS: 29; BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY: 0.37). SELF-PROTECTION SCORE WAS THE SUPER-FACTOR IN THE UNINFECTED GROUP BUT WAS THE ISOLATED FACTOR IN THE INFECTED GROUP (DEGREE: 201; CLOSENESS: 28; BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY: 5.64).

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF COLLECTIVE-LEVEL SOCIAL ISOLATION ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF GROUP-LEVEL SEGREGATION WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH (CVH) IN OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: FROM THE PROSPECTIVE KOREAN SOCIAL LIFE, HEALTH, AND AGING PROJECT DATABASE, WE IDENTIFIED 528 COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WHO WERE AGED ≥60 YEARS OR WERE MARRIED TO THOSE AGED ≥60 YEARS. PARTICIPANTS WHO BELONGED TO SMALLER SOCIAL GROUPS SEPARATE FROM THE MAJOR SOCIAL GROUP WERE DEFINED AS GROUP-LEVEL-SEGREGATED. THE CVH SCORE WAS CALCULATED AS THE NUMBER OF IDEAL NON-DIETARY CVH METRICS (0-6), AS MODIFIED FROM THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S LIFE'S SIMPLE 7. USING ORDINAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS, WE ASSESSED CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GROUP-LEVEL SEGREGATION AND CVH. RESULTS: OF THE 528 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE, 71.7 YEARS; 60.0% FEMALE), 108 (20.5%) WERE SEGREGATED AT BASELINE. IN THE CROSSSECTIONAL ANALYSIS, GROUP-LEVEL SEGREGATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ODDS OF HAVING A HIGHER CVH SCORE AT BASELINE AFTER ADJUSTING FOR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION (ODDS RATIO [OR], 0.64; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 0.43 TO 0.95). AMONG 274 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED AN 8-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, GROUP-LEVEL SEGREGATION AT BASELINE WAS MARGINALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ODDS OF HAVING A HIGHER CVH SCORE AT 8 YEARS (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 TO 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: GROUP-LEVEL SEGREGATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE CVH. THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT THE SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE OF A COMMUNITY MAY INFLUENCE ITS MEMBERS' HEALTH STATUS.","10.4178/EPIH.E2023041","2092-7193 (ELECTRONIC) 2092-7193 (LINKING)","EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH","E2023041","ASSOCIATION OF GROUPLEVEL SEGREGATION WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS AN ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE KOREAN SOCIAL LIFE HEALTH AND AGING PROJECT","45",2023,"ISI","EPIDEMIOL HEALTH",0,"none","CENTER FOR HAPPINESS STUDIES, SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, YONSEI UNIVERSITY, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, YONSEI UNIVERSITY, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, SEOUL, KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, SEOUL, KOREA.;","SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;YONSEI UNIVERSITY;YONSEI UNIVERSITY;YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;YONSEI UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","LEE SH, 2023, EPIDEMIOL HEALTH","LEE SH, 2023, EPIDEMIOL HEALTH"

HERE, WE USED FRENCH LIVE DUCK MOVEMENT DATA (2016-2018) FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST TRANSPORT COMPANIES TO COMPARE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONTACT PATTERNS BETWEEN DUCK FARMS AND EVALUATE HOW THESE PATTERNS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRENCH 2016-2017 EPIDEMIC OF HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA H5N8. A TOTAL NUMBER OF 614 FARMS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, AND TWO DIRECTED NETWORKS WERE GENERATED: THE ANIMAL INTRODUCTION NETWORK (EXCHANGE OF LIVE DUCKS) AND THE TRANSIT NETWORK (TRANSIT OF TRANSPORT VEHICLES). FOLLOWING DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES, THESE TWO NETWORKS WERE SCRUTINIZED IN RELATION TO FARM INFECTION STATUS DURING THE EPIDEMIC. RESULTS SHOWED THAT FARMS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CONNECTED IN THE TRANSIT NETWORK THAN IN THE ANIMAL INTRODUCTION NETWORK AND THAT THE TRANSIT OF TRANSPORT VEHICLES GENERATED MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRANSMISSION THAN THE EXCHANGE OF LIVE ANIMALS. WE ALSO SHOWED THAT ANIMAL INTRODUCTION AND TRANSIT NETWORKS' STATISTICS DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE EPIDEMIC (JANUARY-MARCH 2017) COMPARED TO NON-EPIDEMIC PERIODS (JANUARY-MARCH 2016 AND JANUARY-MARCH 2018).

METHODS: 235 STUDENTS FROM 5 DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL CENTRES PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY BETWEEN MARCH AND DECEMBER 2015. DATA ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO BLOCKS: SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. AS FOR THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, THE GIRVAN-NEWMAN TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO FIND THE BEST NUMBER OF COHESIVE GROUPS WITHIN EACH OF THE FRIENDSHIP NETWORKS OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES ANALYSED. RESULTS: AFTER APPLYING GIRVAN-NEWMAN IN THE THREE CLASSES, THE BEST DIVISION INTO CLUSTERS WAS RESPECTIVELY 2 FOR CLASSROOM A, 7 FOR CLASSROOM B AND 6 FOR CLASSROOM C.

METHODS: CONTACT TRACERS INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALS WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR SARS-COV-2 BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2020 AND MARCH 2021, AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD CONTACT. WE CONDUCTED A 2-MODE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF PEOPLE BY THE TYPES OF PLACES THEY VISITED, FOCUSING ON THE FORMS OF CENTRALITY EXHIBITED BY PLACE TYPES. RESULTS: THE MOST EXPOSED LOCATIONS WERE GROCERY STORES, COMMERCIAL STORES, RESTAURANTS, COMMERCIAL SERVICES, AND SCHOOLS. THESE TYPES OF LOCATIONS ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST ""BETWEENNESS,"" MEANING THAT THEY TEND TO SERVE AS HUBS BETWEEN OTHER KINDS OF LOCATIONS SINCE PEOPLE WOULD USUALLY VISIT MORE THAN 1 LOCATION IN A DAY OR WHEN INFECTED. THE HIGHEST PAIRS OF LOCATIONS WERE GROCERY STORE/RETAIL STORE, RESTAURANT/RETAIL STORE, AND RESTAURANT/GROCERY STORE. SCHOOLS ARE NOT AT THE TOP BUT ARE 3 TIMES IN THE TOP 7 PAIRS OF LOCATIONS AND CONNECTED TO THE 3 TYPES OF LOCATIONS IN THOSE TOP PAIRS.

CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS WERE ASSESSED WITH AN OPEN-ENDED RESPONSE ITEM, WHICH ASKED PATIENTS TO LIST WHAT THEY THOUGHT WERE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSAL FACTORS OF THEIR ILLNESS. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS WERE DETERMINED THROUGH UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS WERE OBTAINED USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. A TOTAL OF 299 PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED 707 RESPONSES. STRESS, DIET, AND EXERCISE WERE BELIEVED TO BE THE THREE MOST LIKELY CAUSES OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS AND THE AGE, EDUCATION LEVEL, MARITAL STATUS, OR CANCER STAGE OF PATIENTS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PERSONALITY, GENETICS, AND REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY AND PATIENT-IDENTIFIED CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS ACCORDING TO THE PATIENTS' FAMILY HISTORY OF CANCER. PATIENTS WITH A FAMILY HISTORY OF CANCER WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE THAT PERSONALITY AND GENETICS/FAMILY HISTORY WERE CAUSES OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITHOUT SUCH A HISTORY.

TO PREVENT INCURSIONS OF COVID-19 IN RACS IN AUSTRALIA, VISITORS WERE BANNED AND AGED-CARE WORKERS WERE ENCOURAGED TO WORK AT A SINGLE SITE. WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF CASE NOTES AND A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WORKPLACE AND SOCIAL NETWORKS ENABLED THE SPREAD OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY CORONAVIRUS VIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2) AMONG RACS. DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE OUTBREAK REVIEW. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: STAFF INVOLVED IN COVID-19 OUTBREAKS IN RACS IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA, MAY-OCTOBER 2020. METHODS: THE VICTORIAN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH COVID-19 CASE AND CONTACT DATA WERE REVIEWED TO CONSTRUCT 2 SOCIAL NETWORKS: (1) A WORK NETWORK CONNECTING RACS THROUGH WORKERS AND (2) A HOUSEHOLD NETWORK CONNECTING TO RACS THROUGH HOUSEHOLDS. PROBABLE INDEX CASES WERE REVIEWED TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER AND SIZE (NUMBER OF RESIDENT CASES AND DEATHS) OF OUTBREAKS LIKELY INITIATED BY MULTISITE WORK VERSUS TRANSMISSION VIA HOUSEHOLDS. RESULTS: AMONG 2,033 CASES LINKED TO AN OUTBREAK AS STAFF, 91 (4.5%) WERE MULTISITE STAFF CASES. FORTY-THREE OUTBREAKS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO MULTISITE WORK AND 35 WERE DEEMED POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE HAD STAFF WORKED AT A SINGLE SITE.

SOME STUDIES ARGUE THAT HIGH-DENSITY URBAN CENTERS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES DUE TO A HIGHER CHANCE OF INFECTION IN CROWDED URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. OTHER STUDIES, HOWEVER, ARGUE THAT CONNECTIVITY RATHER THAN POPULATION DENSITY PLAYS A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF URBAN DENSITY AND CONNECTIVITY IN EUROPE AND THE U.S., FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN ASIAN COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF URBAN SPATIAL STRUCTURE ON COVID-19 BY COMPARING DIFFERENT MEASURES OF URBAN DENSITY AND CONNECTIVITY DURING THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE OUTBREAK IN KOREA. TWO MEASURES OF DENSITY WERE DERIVED FROM THE KOREAN CENSUS, AND FOUR MEASURES OF CONNECTIVITY WERE COMPUTED USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS OF THE ORIGIN-DESTINATION DATA FROM THE 2020 KOREA TRANSPORT DATABASE. WE FITTED BOTH OLS AND NEGATIVE BINOMIAL MODELS TO THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENTS AND ITS INFECTION RATES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL, COLLECTED INDIVIDUALLY FROM REGIONAL GOVERNMENT WEBSITES IN KOREA. RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH DENSITY AND CONNECTIVITY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROLIFERATION OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN KOREA.

HERE, WE SOUGHT HERE TO ASSIGN UNREPORTED HIV RISK FACTORS IN BLOOD DONORS (BDS) AND REEVALUATED THE MSM-ASSOCIATED FRACTION OF HIV TRANSFUSION RESIDUAL RISK (%RR(MSM) ). METHODS: WE APPLIED A GENETIC DISTANCE-BASED APPROACH TO INFER AN HIV TRANSMISSION NETWORK FOR 384 HIV SEQUENCES FROM FRENCH BDS AND 1337 HIV SEQUENCES FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH KNOWN RISK FACTORS (ANRS PRIMO PRIMARY HIV INFECTION COHORT). WE VALIDATED THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSIGNING A RISK FACTOR ACCORDING TO CLUSTERING USING ASSORTATIVE MIXING. FINALLY, WE RECALCULATED THE %RR(MSM) . RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 81 OF 284 (28.5%) MALE AND 5 OF 100 (5%) FEMALE BDS BELONGED TO A CLUSTER; 72 (88.9%) OF THE 81 MALE BDS BELONGED TO MSM CLUSTERS. AFTER CLUSTER CORRECTION, 8 OF 67 (11.9%), 4 OF 21 (19.0%), AND 19 OF 88 (21.6%) HIV-POSITIVE (HIV+) MALE BDS WITH HETEROSEXUAL, OTHER, OR UNKNOWN RISK FACTORS COULD BE RECLASSIFIED AS MSM, ACCOUNTING FOR 10.9% OF THE TOTAL HIV+ MALE BDS.

PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS ALONE MAY BE AT HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING HARMS, FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO LACK OF OTHERS WHO MAY CALL FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. ALTERNATIVELY, CRYPTOMARKETS MAY BE A SOURCE OF HARM REDUCTION INFORMATION AND DRUGS WITH BETTER-KNOWN CONTENT AND DOSE, POTENTIALLY REDUCING THE RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS. THIS STUDY EXAMINES RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRYPTOMARKET USE, DRUG-USING SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS FOR MDMA, COCAINE AND LSD. METHOD: A SUBSAMPLE OF 23,053 RESPONDENTS FROM OVER 70 COUNTRIES WAS COLLECTED IN THE 2018 GLOBAL DRUG SURVEY. PEOPLE WHO REPORTED USING MDMA, COCAINE OR LSD WERE ASKED ABOUT USING CRYPTOMARKETS TO PURCHASE THESE DRUGS; ANY ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS REQUIRING MEDICAL TREATMENT (COMBINING SEEKING TREATMENT AND SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT TREATMENT BUT DID NOT); AND SOCIAL NETWORKS WHO THEY HAD USED THE SPECIFIC DRUG WITH. ALL MEASURES REFERRED TO THE LAST 12 MONTHS, HEREON REFERRED TO AS 'RECENT'. BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS EXAMINED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRYPTOMARKET USE, DRUG-USING SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS, CONTROLLING FOR AGE, GENDER, AND FREQUENCY OF DRUG USE. RESULTS: ADVERSE EVENTS FROM ANY DRUG TYPE WERE LOW (5.2%) AND FOR EACH DRUG; MDMA (3.5%); COCAINE (3.3%); AND LSD (3.5%). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COVARIATES, RECENT CRYPTOMARKET USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING NO DRUG-USING NETWORK FOR EACH DRUG TYPE. PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY USED CRYPTOMARKETS WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT ADVERSE COCAINE (AOR = 1.70 (1.22-2.37)) AND LSD (AOR = 1.58 (1.12-2.09)) EVENTS. FOR THOSE REPORTING A NETWORK SIZE >1, NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS DID NOT DIFFER WITH RECENT CRYPTOMARKET USE; HOWEVER, THOSE REPORTING RECENT CRYPTOMARKET USE WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT ADVERSE LSD EVENTS (AOR = 1.86 (0.99-3.51)). CONCLUSION: PEOPLE WHO REPORTED PURCHASING DRUGS FROM CRYPTOMARKETS MORE COMMONLY REPORTED HAVING NO DRUG-USING NETWORK, AND CRYPTOMARKET PURCHASE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT CRYPTOMARKET USE INCREASES DRUG-RELATED HARM, BUT FURTHER DISENTANGLEMENT OF MULTIPLE COMPLEX MECHANISMS IS NEEDED IN FUTURE RESEARCH.","S0955-3959(23)00305-5","1873-4758 (ELECTRONIC) 0955-3959 (LINKING)","THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DRUG POLICY","104258","THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRYPTOMARKET DRUG PURCHASE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS A CROSSSECTIONAL STUDY","123",2024,"ISI","INT J DRUG POLICY",0,"none","NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE, UNSW SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: L.;CONEY@STUDENT.;UNSW.;EDU.;AU.; NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE, UNSW SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF CRIMINOLOGY, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH, CA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WORK, AALBORG UNIVERSITY, DENMARK.; DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER, MANCHESTER, UK.; CENTRE FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND, BRISBANE, QLD, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF), SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA.; INSTITUTE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, LONDON, UK; GLOBAL DRUG SURVEY, LONDON, UK.; NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE, UNSW SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA; SOCIAL EQUITY RESEARCH CENTRE AND DIGITAL ETHNOGRAPHY RESEARCH CENTRE, RMIT UNIVERSITY, MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA.;","NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE;ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: L.;NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE;CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH;AALBORG UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER;UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF);UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTRE;RMIT UNIVERSITY","CONEY L, 2024, INT J DRUG POLICY","CONEY L, 2024, INT J DRUG POLICY"

THEREFORE, PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES MANDATE LIVESTOCK HOLDINGS TO REPORT ALL MOVEMENTS OF ANIMALS. HOWEVER, THE REPORTED DATA OFTEN DOES NOT CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF TRANSPORTS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF TRUCK SHARING AND TRUCK CONTAMINATION ON DISEASE TRANSMISSION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE TOPOLOGY OF THE SWISS PIG TRANSPORT NETWORK BY MEANS OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND TO ASSESS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN ANIMAL HOLDINGS. IN PARTICULAR, WE STUDIED HOW ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT TRANSPORT SEQUENCES CHANGES THE TOPOLOGY OF THE CONTACT NETWORK. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE OFFICIAL ANIMAL MOVEMENT DATABASE IN SWITZERLAND AND A SAMPLE OF TRANSPORT DATA FROM ONE TRANSPORT COMPANY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SWISS PIG TRANSPORT NETWORK IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, WHICH MITIGATES THE RISK OF A LARGE-SCALE DISEASE OUTBREAK. BY CONSIDERING THE TIME SEQUENCE OF TRANSPORTS, WE FOUND THAT EVEN IN THE WORST CASE, ONLY 0.34% OF ALL FARM-PAIRS WERE CONNECTED WITHIN ONE MONTH. HOWEVER, BOTH NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONNECTEDNESS OF FARMS INCREASED IF TRUCK SHARING AND ESPECIALLY TRUCK CONTAMINATION WERE CONSIDERED. THEREFORE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH A DISEASE MAY BE TRANSMITTED BETWEEN ANIMAL HOLDINGS MAY BE UNDERESTIMATED IF WE ONLY CONSIDER DATA FROM THE OFFICIAL ANIMAL MOVEMENT DATABASE. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF CONTACTS BETWEEN FARMS THAT INCLUDES INDIRECT CONTACTS DUE TO TRUCK SHARING AND CONTAMINATION. AS THE NATURE OF ANIMAL TRANSPORT NETWORKS IS INHERENTLY TEMPORAL, WE STRONGLY SUGGEST THE USE OF TEMPORAL NETWORK MEASURES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL AND OVERALL RISK OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION THROUGH ANIMAL TRANSPORTATION.","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0217974","1932-6203 (ELECTRONIC) 1932-6203 (LINKING)","PLOS ONE","E0217974","THE PIG TRANSPORT NETWORK IN SWITZERLAND STRUCTURE PATTERNS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES BETWEEN ANIMAL HOLDINGS","14",2019,"ISI","PLOS ONE",0,"none","DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.; SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL, BIRMENSDORF, SWITZERLAND.; SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES AND ARTS NORTHWESTERN SWITZERLAND FHNW, OLTEN, SWITZERLAND.; VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE, VETSUISSE FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF BERN, BERN, SWITZERLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.; SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL, BIRMENSDORF, SWITZERLAND.; VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE, VETSUISSE FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF BERN, BERN, SWITZERLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.; SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL, BIRMENSDORF, SWITZERLAND.; CLINIC FOR SWINE, VETSUISSE FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF BERN, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;","UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH;SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL;UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES AND ARTS NORTHWESTERN SWITZERLAND FHNW;UNIVERSITY OF BERN;UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH;UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH;SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL;UNIVERSITY OF BERN;UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH;SWISS FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WSL;UNIVERSITY OF BERN","STERCHI M, 2019, PLOS ONE","STERCHI M, 2019, PLOS ONE"

INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS (ADE) IN SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS IN SINGLE TIME POINTS, WE PROPOSE A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT LOOKS AT THE EVOLUTION OF DIFFERENT USER BEHAVIOR INDICATORS IN TIME. WE EXAMINE VARIOUS NLP-BASED INDICATORS SUCH AS WORD FREQUENCY, SEMANTIC SIMILARITY, ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS MENTIONS, AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. WE INTRODUCE A CLASSIFICATION APPROACH TO IDENTIFY NORMAL VS. ABNORMAL TIME PERIODS BASED ON PATIENT COMMENTS. THIS APPROACH, ALONG WITH USER BEHAVIOR INDICATORS, CAN OPTIMIZE THE PHARMACOVIGILANCE PROCESS BY FLAGGING THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND FURTHER INVESTIGATION. WE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON THE LEVOTHYROX® CASE IN FRANCE, WHICH SPARKED MEDIA ATTENTION DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MEDICATION FORMULA AND AFFECTED PATIENT BEHAVIOR ON MEDICAL FORUMS. FOR CLASSIFICATION, WE PROPOSE A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE CALLED WORD CLOUD CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (WC-CNN), TRAINED ON WORD CLOUDS FROM PATIENT COMMENTS.

RECENTLY, A GROWING NUMBER OF LAYER FARMS HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DAMAGED FROM THE HPAIV EPIDEMIC DUE TO THE INCREASED VIRULENCE OF THE VIRUS AND THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM. THEREFORE, STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES AT THE FARM LEVEL THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH CONTINGENCY MEASURES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO MINIMIZE POULTRY LOSSES. HOWEVER, NUMEROUS BIOSECURITY PROTOCOLS FOR LAYER FARM WORKERS TO FOLLOW HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, IMPEDING EFFICIENT PREVENTION AND CONTROL. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOSECURITY PRACTICES VARIES WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITION AND INTER-FARM CONTACT STRUCTURES. HENCE, THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PREVENTIVE EFFECT OF FIVE BIOSECURITY ACTIONS COMMONLY PRACTICED AT LAYER FARMS IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AGAINST HPAIV H5N6: (I) FENCE INSTALLATION AROUND A FARM, II) RODENT CONTROL INSIDE A FARM; III) DISINFECTION BOOTH FOR VISITORS FOR DISINFECTION PROTOCOLS, IV) AN ANTERIOR ROOM IN THE SHEDS BEFORE ENTERING THE BIRD AREA AND V) BOOTS CHANGES WHEN MOVING BETWEEN SHEDS IN THE SAME FARM. WE CONDUCTED A CASE-CONTROL STUDY ON 114 LAYER CASE FARMS AND 129 LAYER CONTROL FARMS DURING THE 2016-17 HPAI EPIDEMIC. THE ODDS RATIOS FOR FIVE ON-FARM BIOSECURITY PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE STUDY GROUPS WERE ESTIMATED AS A PREVENTIVE EFFECT ON THE HPAI INFECTION WITH COVARIATES, INCLUDING SEVEN GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS AND THREE NETWORK METRICS USING BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION WEIGHTED LOGISTIC REGRESSION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE USE OF A DISINFECTION BOOTH FOR PERSONNEL REDUCED THE ODDS OF HPAIV H5N6 INFECTION (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR] = 0.002, 95 % CREDIBLE INTERVAL [CRI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) WITH RELATIVELY SMALL SPATIAL VARIATION (MINIMUM AOR - MAXIMUM AOR: 0.084-0.263). CHANGING BOOTS BETWEEN SHEDS ON THE SAME FARM REDUCED THE ODDS OF HPAIV H5N6 INFECTION (AOR = 0.160, 95 % CRI = 0.024-0.852) WITH RELATIVELY WIDE SPATIAL VARIATION (MINIMUM AOR - MAXIMUM AOR = 0.270-0.688). THEREFORE, ENHANCED PERSONNEL BIOSECURITY PROTOCOLS AT THE FARM OF ENTRY FOR LAYER FARMS IS RECOMMENDED TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT AND RESPOND TO HPAIV H5N6 INFECTION UNDER DIFFERENT LOCAL CONDITION.

LITTLE IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, ABOUT WHETHER POLICIES AFFECT HOW BEHAVIOURS ARE SHARED IN A NETWORK. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LITERATURE, WE APPLY THE CONCEPT OF DIFFUSION CENTRALITY TO SCHOOL TOBACCO POLICIES AND ADOLESCENT SMOKING. DIFFUSION CENTRALITY IS A MEASURE OF CENTRALITY WHICH REFERS TO A PERSON'S ABILITY TO DIFFUSE A GIVEN PROPERTY-IN OUR CASE, SMOKING-RELATED BEHAVIOURS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT STRONGER SCHOOL TOBACCO POLICIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS DIFFUSION CENTRALITY OF SMOKING ON SCHOOL PREMISES AND OF SMOKING IN GENERAL. A WHOLE NETWORK STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN 2013 AND 2016 AMONG ADOLESCENTS (N = 18,805) IN 38 SCHOOLS LOCATED IN SIX EUROPEAN CITIES. OVERALL, DIFFUSION CENTRALITY OF SMOKING IN GENERAL AND OF SMOKING ON SCHOOL PREMISES SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED OVER TIME. DIFFUSION CENTRALITY OF SMOKING SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BOTH IN SCHOOLS WHERE THE POLICY STRENGTHENED OR SOFTENED OVER TIME, BUT FOR DIFFUSION OF SMOKING ON SCHOOL PREMISES, THIS DECREASE WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANT IN SCHOOLS WHERE IT STRENGTHENED. FINALLY, STRONGER SCHOOL TOBACCO POLICIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER DIFFUSION CENTRALITY OF SMOKING ON SCHOOL PREMISES AND OF SMOKING IN GENERAL, THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT. WITH SUCH POLICIES, SMOKING MAY, THEREFORE, BECOME LESS PREVALENT, LESS POPULAR, AND LESS CLUSTERED, THEREBY LOWERING THE RISK OF IT SPREADING WITHIN NETWORKS IN, AND EVEN OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.","10.1007/S11121-022-01486-X","1573-6695 (ELECTRONIC) 1389-4986 (LINKING)","PREVENTION SCIENCE : THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PREVENTION RESEARCH","752-764","THE DIFFUSION OF SMOKING ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SCHOOL TOBACCO POLICIES AND THE DIFFUSION OF ADOLESCENT SMOKING IN 38 SCHOOLS IN 6 COUNTRIES","24",2023,"ISI","PREV SCI",0,"none","INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY (IRSS), UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.; NORA.;MELARD@UCLOUVAIN.;BE.; INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY (IRSS), UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.; INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, ELECTRONICS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS, UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY, OPEN UNIVERSITY, HEERLEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; NOVA NATIONAL SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH CENTRE, COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH RESEARCH CENTER, CHRC, NOVA UNIVERSITY LISBON, LISBON, PORTUGAL.; DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, AMSTERDAM PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE, AMSTERDAM UMC, UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM, AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.; INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY (IRSS), UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;","UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN;UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN;UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN;OPEN UNIVERSITY;NOVA UNIVERSITY LISBON;UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;UNIVERSITÉ CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN","MÉLARD N, 2023, PREV SCI","MÉLARD N, 2023, PREV SCI"

SOCIAL RELATIONS AND MULTIGENERATIONAL NETWORKS (I.E., PEER, FAMILY, KINSHIP, AND COMMUNITY) REMAIN A SALIENT FIXTURE OF AI CULTURE, SURVIVAL AND THRIVING IN RESERVATION COMMUNITIES. RESEARCH IN OTHER POPULATIONS HAS DEMONSTRATED HOW SOCIAL NETWORKS IMPACT YOUTH RISK AND RESILIENCE, BUT DATA ARE LACKING ON AI ADOLESCENT NETWORKS. INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA FROM SETTLER COLONIALISM LEADS SOME AI YOUTH TO EARLY INITIATION OF SUBSTANCE USE AND SUBSEQUENT SUBSTANCE MISUSE, ALONG WITH DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE AND VULNERABILITY TO WITNESSING AND EXPERIENCING VIOLENCE. USING NETWORK DATA TO DEVELOP PREVENTION STRATEGIES AMONG THIS POPULATION IS A PROMISING NEW AVENUE OF RESEARCH. IN THIS STUDY PROTOCOL PAPER, WE DESCRIBE THE RATIONALE AND METHODOLOGY OF AN EXPLORATORY STUDY TO BE CONDUCTED WITH AMERICAN INDIAN 9TH AND 10TH GRADERS AT THREE SCHOOLS ON A NORTHERN PLAINS RESERVATION. METHODS: THIS MIXED METHODS STUDY WILL COLLECT QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL NETWORK SURVEYS (N = 300) AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS (N = 30). THE STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING SOCIAL NETWORK THEORIES AND DATA METRICS ADEQUATELY CHARACTERIZE AI YOUTH NETWORKS OR HOW THEY MAY NEED TO BE EXPANDED FOR THIS POPULATION. ASSOCIATIONS OF NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS WITH RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR SUBSTANCE USE, EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE, AND SUICIDE WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED. DISCUSSION: THIS INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH HOLDS PROMISE FOR INFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESS CO-OCCURRING RISKS FOR SUBSTANCE USE, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE AMONG AI ADOLESCENTS.

ACTIVE CASE FINDING WAS CONDUCTED AMONG WORKERS IN BOTH FACTORIES USING FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS. SUSPECTED CASES WERE DEFINED AS A WORKER WHO DEVELOPED FEVER WITH RASH WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: COUGH, CORYZA OR CONJUNCTIVITIS. TESTING FOR MEASLES IGM ANTIBODIES AND VIRAL IDENTIFICATION THROUGH THROAT SWABS BY POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) WERE PERFORMED TO CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS. VACCINATION HISTORY AMONG CASES WAS REVIEWED.

INDEED, THE MOVEMENT OF LIVE ANIMALS AND OF THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT IS ONE OF THE MAIN RISK FACTORS IN THE SPREAD OF DISEASES AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN AREAS WITH HIGH STOCKING DENSITY. DESIGN: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON MOVEMENTS OF PIGS ENTERING LOMBARDY WAS CARRIED OUT. DATA ON PIGS' MOVEMENTS AND FARM CHARACTERISTICS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL DATABASES. SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE FLOWS OF PIGS TO LOMBARDY, TO IDENTIFY THE HOLDINGS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS THAT ARE CENTRAL IN THE TRADING NETWORK AND THAT COULD HAVE A ROLE IN THE INTRODUCTION OF SWINE PATHOGENS INTO THE REGION. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: DATA ON PIGS' MOVEMENTS INTRODUCED INTO LOMBARDY IN 2016 WERE ANALYSED. LOMBARDY IS A REGION OF NORTHERN ITALY WITH INTENSIVE LIVESTOCK HUSBANDRY. THE PIG SECTOR IS OF PARTICULAR ECONOMIC RELEVANCE ALSO IN VIEW OF THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY, SUITED TO THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY PORK PRODUCTS. ANNUALLY ABOUT 1.8 MILLION PIGS ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE REGION ALSO TO SATISFY THE REQUEST OF THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PORK PRODUCTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IN THIS STUDY, THE FARMS THAT BUY PIGS FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION WERE IDENTIFIED AS WELL AS THE TERRITORIES WHERE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PIGS ARE INTRODUCED. THE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ALSO CONSIDERING CERTAIN FACTORS RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS, WHICH CAN BE RELEVANT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF PATHOGENS, SUCH AS NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL PARTNERS, NUMBER OF EXCHANGED ANIMALS, AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS. RESULTS: IN 2016, 1,782,568 PIGS WERE INTRODUCED INTO LOMBARDY; BY USING SNA, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HIGHLIGHT A COMPLEX TRADE NETWORK OF PIGS, MAINLY INVOLVING THE NORTHERN REGIONS. INDEED, THE PIGS WERE MOSTLY PURCHASED FROM EMILIA ROMAGNA (33.4%), FOLLOWED BY VENETO AND PIEDMONT. THESE REGIONS HAVE BEEN THE MOST CLOSELY ANALYSED IN THIS STUDY. SNA WAS ALSO USED TO IDENTIFY LOMBARDY TERRITORIES (PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES) WHICH, BASED ON THE NUMBER OF INTRODUCED PIGS, ARE POTENTIALLY MOST EXPOSED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF PATHOGENS FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION. MANTUA AND BRESCIA PROVINCES RESULTED THE MOST EXPOSED AREA. CONCLUSIONS: ITALY IS ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT EUROPEAN PRODUCERS OF PIGS AND ABOUT 50% OF NATIONAL PIG ASSETS IS PRESENT IN LOMBARDY; FURTHERMORE, ABOUT 1.8 MILLION PIGS ARE INTRODUCED YEARLY INTO THE REGION. CURRENTLY, THE REGION IS FREE FROM THE MAIN DISEASES OF PIGS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE INTO THE PIG POPULATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ENTIRE PRODUCTIVE SECTOR. FOR THIS REASON, AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF PIGS ENTERING THE REGION WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS (PROVINCES, MUNICIPALITIES) AND HOLDINGS MOST EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF INTRODUCTION OF PATHOGENS. THIS INFORMATION IS RELEVANT FOR THE VETERINARY AUTHORITIES TO PLAN APPROPRIATE CONTROL ACTIVITIES (OFFICIAL CONTROLS, SURVEILLANCE, BIOSECURITY, AND VACCINATION, WHERE POSSIBLE) IN ORDER TO ENHANCE DISEASE PREVENTION AND PROMOTE EARLY DETECTION.","10.19191/EP21.1-2.P037.037","1120-9763 (PRINT) 1120-9763 (LINKING)","EPIDEMIOLOGIA E PREVENZIONE","37-45","ANALYSIS OF PIGS MOVEMENT TO LOMBARDY NORTHERN ITALY TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PATHOGENS INTRODUCTION INTO THIS REGION AND TO PLAN MITIGATION MEASURES","45",2021,"ISI","EPIDEMIOL PREV",0,"none","ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLA LOMBARDIA ED EMILIA-ROMAGNA, BRESCIA; ALESSANDRA.;SCABURRI@IZSLER.;IT.; ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLA LOMBARDIA ED EMILIA-ROMAGNA, BRESCIA.; ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLA LOMBARDIA ED EMILIA-ROMAGNA, BRESCIA.; ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLA LOMBARDIA ED EMILIA-ROMAGNA, BRESCIA.; ISTITUTO ZOOPROFILATTICO SPERIMENTALE DELLA LOMBARDIA ED EMILIA-ROMAGNA, BRESCIA.;","BRESCIA;BRESCIA.;BRESCIA.;BRESCIA.;BRESCIA.","SCABURRI A, 2021, EPIDEMIOL PREV","SCABURRI A, 2021, EPIDEMIOL PREV"

WE USE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE 2019 US DEATH CERTIFICATE DATA TO REASSEMBLE CHAINS OF MORBID EVENTS LEADING TO DEATH. FROM THEM, WE CONSTRUCT AND ANALYZE DIRECTED MULTIPLE CAUSE OF DEATH NETWORKS BY RACE AND SEX OF DEATHS AGED 60+. THREE PERSPECTIVES TO MEASURE DISPARITIES ARE EMPLOYED: (I) RELATIVE PREVALENCE OF CAUSE-OF-DEATH-PAIRS, (II) STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DISEASES, (III) SIMILARITIES IN TRANSITION MATRICES. NON-HISPANIC BLACKS (NHB) HAD OVERALL LOWER PREVALENCE OF CAUSE OF DEATH PAIRS, HISPANICS (HIS) WERE BURDENED MORE BY ALCOHOL-RELATED MORTALITY AND ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS (API) EXCEEDED IN TRANSITIONS TO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES. LOWER SIMILARITY WAS OBSERVED IN TRANSITIONS TO EXTERNAL CAUSES OF DEATH, DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, PULMONARY HEART DISEASES, INTERSTITIAL RESPIRATORY DISEASES, AND DISEASES OF THE LIVER. AFTER EXCLUDING RARE DISEASES, THE SIMILARITY FURTHER DECREASED FOR ILL-DEFINED CONDITIONS, DIABETES MELLITUS, OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, DISEASES OF THE PLEURA, AND ANEMIA.
