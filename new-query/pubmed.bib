  abstract = "The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged public health practitioners
              and clinicians at multiple levels to intentionally consider the
              impact of social isolation on health outcomes. Many
              community-based programmes design interventions to address
              tangible challenges within the social determinants of health,
              such as asset insecurity or food insecurity, to address health
              inequities. The growing need to address social isolation within
              marginalised communities also requires organisations to
              collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen
              their own social integration within the community. The present
              research reports on the results of a Social Network Analysis
              (SNA) of community programmes within three southern U.S. cities
              and their local collaborations to address social isolation. After
              interviewing representatives of 46 community organisations, it
              was found that social service organisations that also offer
              public health services play a central role in community efforts
              to improve social isolation. The participating organisations
              primarily collaborate through referrals and information sharing,
              and report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition that
              social services and supports play a considerable role in
              addressing health inequities, this study provides evidence of
              opportunities for interorganisational collaboration to promote

              most important role in the Canadian networks, whereas the
              Presidents play the most significant role in them, in the US, and
              Mexico. WHO shows a pivotal effect on social networks of COVID-19

              by multiple individual and contextual factors, with recent

              understanding of these relationships could help inform healthy
              weight promoting interventions. We conducted a feasibility study
              among youth at risk of obesity to document process outcomes, to
              discern relationships between PSN features and weight-related
              behaviors, and to generate hypotheses with respect to perceived
              social support (SS) and sex. Methods: Participants (egos)
              nominated up to 10 people (alters) with whom they discussed
              important matters. Egos reported their own and each alter's age,
              sex, body shape, lifestyle behaviors, relation, frequency of
              exercising with each alter, and of being encouraged by each alter
              to exercise. We examined relationships between PSN features and
              weight-related outcomes and explored the role of SS, using both
              correlational and linear regression analyses. Results: There were
              45 participants (mean age 16.4 years) and body mass index z-score
              (zBMI) ranged from -1.2 to 3.9. There were few missing responses
              to PSN items; broad variation across most items, including SS
              scores, was reported. Correlations pointed to plausible
              relationships implicating PSN features and lifestyle behaviors.
              In exploratory analyses, network-based SS was positively
              associated with adiposity in girls and negatively associated in
              boys, while lifestyle role modelling was not associated with
              adiposity. Conclusions: Our findings support the feasibility of
              measuring the PSN in youth and the potential for using social
              network analysis to investigate social and behavioral mechanisms
              associated with obesity.",

              of social network analysis to understand public discourse on
              Twitter around the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. We examined different network properties that might
              affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public
              health messages from public health officials and health agencies.
              METHODS: We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key
              communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We
              used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly
              available data from social media sites such as Twitter. RESULTS:
              We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is
              highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these
              characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public
              health messages in a network. Competing conversations and
              misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way

              are at high risk for obesity and related cardiovascular risk.
              Social network factors influence health behaviors and are
              important contributors to the obesity epidemic. The objective of
              this study was to describe social networks and obesity-related
              characteristics among adult Somali immigrants in a Minnesota city
              in order to inform a community-based, participatory,
              research-derived, social network intervention to decrease obesity
              rates. METHODS: Survey data (demographics, general health
              measures, and sociobehavioral and network measures) and height
              and weight measures (for calculating body mass index) were
              collected from adult Somali immigrants by bilingual study team
              members at community locations. Descriptive statistics were used
              to report the survey and biometric data. Logistic regression
              models were used to describe the basic associations of
              participants and network factors. Network data were analyzed to
              identify nodes and ties, to visualize the network, and to
              identify potential interventionists for a future social network
              intervention. RESULTS: Of the 646 participants, 50\% were
              overweight or affected by obesity. The network had 1703 nodes
              with 3583 ties between nodes, and modularity was high (0.75).
              Compared with respondents of normal weight, participants who were
              overweight or affected by obesity had more network members who
              were also overweight or obese (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95\% CI,
              1.11-7.56; P = .03); this was most notable for men (OR, 4.58;
              95\% CI, 1.22-17.22; P = .02) and suggestive for those 50 years
              or older (OR, 24.23; 95\% CI, 1.55-377.83; P = .03). Weight loss
              intention among participants who were overweight or affected by
              obesity was associated with number of family members and friends
              trying to lose weight, enabling functional network factors
              (social norms for weight loss, social support for healthy eating,
              and social cohesion), and less favorable obesogenic social norms.
              CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample of Somali immigrants,
              distinct social networks are clustered by weight status, and
              social contacts and functional network characteristics are
              related to individuals' weight loss intentions. These factors
              should be considered in weight loss interventions and programs. A
              social network intervention targeting weight loss, within a
              community-based participatory research framework, is feasible in
              this vulnerable population.",

              infection. We used social network analysis to evaluate whether
              contacts have the same S. aureus genotype indicating direct
              transmission or whether contagiousness is an indirect effect of
              contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. METHODS:
              The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among
              1038 high school students. S. aureus carriage was determined from
              two nasal swab cultures and the genotype was determined by
              spa-typing of positive throat swabs. RESULTS: S. aureus carriage
              and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (P < 0.001).
              The probability of carriage increased by 5\% for each S. aureus
              positive contact. Male sex was associated with a 15\% lower risk
              of transmission compared to the female sex, although the carriage
              prevalence was higher for men (36\% vs 24\%). Students with
              medium physical activity levels, medium/high alcohol use, or
              normal weight had a higher number of contacts and an increased
              risk of transmission (P < 0.002). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the
              direct social transmission of S. aureus. Lifestyle factors are
              associated with the risk of transmission, suggesting the effects
              of indirect social groups on S. aureus carriage, such as friends
              having more similar environmental exposures. The male
              predominance in the carriage is determined by sex-specific
              predisposing host characteristics as the social transmission is
              less frequent in males than females. Information on social
              networks may add to a better understanding of S. aureus
              epidemiology.",

              nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early
              report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
              identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a
              likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland,

              connections between nursing homes-and the role these connections
              serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is
              currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on
              cross-facility employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of
              nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using
              device-level geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and
              find that 5.1\% of smartphone users who visited a nursing home
              for at least 1 h also visited another facility during our 11-wk
              study period-even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We

              discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the
              sentiments toward COVID-19. METHODS: This study applied machine
              learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to
              analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating
              exclusively in the United States and written in English during
              the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study
              examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
              sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social
              network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed
              positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of
              the tweets was also conducted. RESULTS: There were a total of
              14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and
              641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of
              902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254
              (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%)
              as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study
              identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets:
              health care environment, emotional support, business economy,
              social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New

              methods were used for 60 articles on HIV syndemics in 2019, where
              they took place, what syndemic clusters emerged, and why this
              matters. RECENT FINDINGS: Most articles published in 2019 used
              regression analyses, and fewer used higher level modeling
              techniques, frequencies and descriptive, longitudinal cohort
              study, and social network analysis. Some employed ethnography,
              qualitative interviews, or were simply reviews. Most syndemic
              co-factors were substance abuse, risky sexual behavior,
              depression, intimate partner violence, stigma, sexually
              transmitted infections, and trauma and non-communicable diseases.
              Half of the studies were conducted in the United States and
              mostly in urban areas. Other contexts were Canada, Kenya, Uganda,
              Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Botswana, Jamaica, Dominican
              Republic, India, Indonesia, China, Peru, and Romania. SUMMARY:
              Most recommendations suggested that people living with HIV need
              interventions that address other factors situated within their
              life, such as their mental health, social stigma, experiences of
              trauma and intimate partner violence, and social stigma and
              sexual risk taking. Many took an intersectoral approach and
              emphasized the need to consider the various factors that shape
              experiences with HIV, from sex, sexuality, class, race and

              In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate
              to each other and call for a complexity science approach to
              advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an
              ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in
              191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with
              a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly
              for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic
              studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We
              identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social
              urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs.
              We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to
              operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with
              individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and
              neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an
              urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales
              and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour
              characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time.
              We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health
              research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by
              discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network
              analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling)
              could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment

              information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect
              influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and
              through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to
              messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified
              messages across social media. These findings show that limiting
              the use of social bots might be an effective method to minimize
              the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.",

              use is widespread among adolescents. During adolescence, many
              changes can cause stress. In this phase, the group of friends
              becomes increasingly important, being a situation of
              vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an
              escape mechanism or due to peer's influence. Therefore, the
              purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the structure of
              the consumption and friendship network, the intention to use
              cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: An
              online platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were
              used for data collection. RESULTS: The sample consisted of
              adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from a third-year class of
              compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (Le{\'o}n, Spain).
              Significant differences were obtained concerning consumption
              intention and the different network metrics in both the
              friendship and consumption networks. Subsequently, the
              representation of these networks was carried out. CONCLUSIONS:
              Social Network Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a
              picture of the context in which adolescents are located. In the
              consumption network, there are central actors who have not yet

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus
              disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has
              led to increased discussions across online platforms. These
              conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by
              social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G
              to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the
              burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of
              the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate
              and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE:
              The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the
              drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to
              deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a
              social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from
              a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4,
              2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on
              Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed
              through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were
              ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's
              vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore
              algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined.
              RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest
              network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast
              group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an
              authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation.
              Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\%
              (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\%
              (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0\% (n=77) were
              general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions.
              Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory
              supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted
              high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the
              conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were
              the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube
              videos were also shared. The study also identified an account
              whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter.
              CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted interventions
              oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key
              to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against
              the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets
              inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that
              policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions
              that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide
              users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which
              should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G
              conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering
              practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context
              of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate
              basic epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also
              be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of
              transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization of
              individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could
              better inform the contact tracing interventions at field levels.
              METHODS: Standard social network analysis methods used for
              exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed
              to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2
              patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set
              with diagnosed patients as ``nodes'' and their epidemiological
              contact as ``edges'' was created. Directed network perspective
              was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a
              ``source patient'' towards a ``target patient''. Network measures
              of `` degree centrality'' and ``betweenness centrality'' were
              calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission
              of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify
              patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was
              used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used
              to categorize influencers. RESULTS: Out-degree centrality
              measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27\%
              (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19\%
              (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12)
              patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have
              collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients.
              Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93)
              patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus
              have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network
              component analysis identified nineteen connected components
              comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted
              for 26.95\% of total patients (1959) and 68.74\% of
              epidemiological contacts in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Social
              network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would
              be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in
              disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual
              patients and patient components who have disproportionately
              contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical
              tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators
              and could help improve the contact tracing activities.",

              a geographical information systems (GIS) environment. METHODS: A
              case and control study design was used to select 2008 patients.
              We retrieved locational data for the patients, which was then
              translated into a network with the SNA software and then GIS
              software. Overall metrics were calculated for the SNA based on
              three datasets and further analysed with a GIS. RESULTS: The SNA
              analysis compared cases to control indicating significant
              differences in the overall structure of the networks. A GIS
              visual representation of these metrics was developed, showing
              spatial variation across the example hospital floor. DISCUSSION:
              This study confirmed the importance that intra-hospital patient
              networks play in the transmission of HAIs, highlighting
              opportunities for interventions utilising these data. Due to
              spatial variation differences, further research is necessary to
              confirm this is not a localised phenomenon, but instead a common
              situation occurring within many hospitals. CONCLUSION: Utilising
              SNA and GIS analysis in conjunction with one another provided a
              data-rich environment in which the risk inherent in
              intra-hospital transfer networks was quantified, visualised and

              decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for that increase
              remain unclear, but the inter-organizational arrangement of organ
              donation programs may have contributed. However, there is a
              paucity of literature investigating these inter-organizational
              arrangements, with a limited understanding of how communication
              facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may

              OBJECTIVE: To describe interprofessional interactions of Organ
              and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) during organ donation
              cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, from an
              organizational perspective (describing structure, context,
              process). METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA)
              approach analyzing 14 organ donation cases just before the
              COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social network graphs
              depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with
              a great part of the communication being processed through the
              OTDC. CONTEXT: Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across
              cases, and health care professionals perceived an atmosphere of
              shared vision and trust among team members. PROCESS: Most
              networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a
              decentralized information flow, and participants perceived
              decisions being jointly made. The characteristic path length of
              cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, suggesting potential for rapid
              information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced the OTDC role of
              intermediator within the communication process, and hospital
              staff perceived OTDCs as central players. Hospital staff and
              OTDCs reported frustration with some aspects of the flow of
              information during the organ allocation processes. CONCLUSION:
              Findings from this study provide a network map of communications

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Mental health disorders often arise during
              adolescence, with disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety
              disorders among the most common. Given the salience of peer
              relationships during adolescence, and research suggesting that
              mental health disorders negatively impact social functioning,
              this study uses novel methodology from social network analysis to
              uncover the social processes linking disruptive behavior
              disorders and anxiety disorders with adolescent friendships. In
              particular, the study focuses on peer withdrawal, peer
              popularity, and peer homophily in relation to both disorders.
              METHODS: Data come from 15-year old students in four Scottish
              secondary schools (N = 602). Diagnoses of disruptive behavior
              disorders and anxiety disorders were produced using the
              Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, and peer relationship
              data were obtained through a friendship nomination survey.
              Exponential random graph models were used to estimate the
              probability of peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer
              homophily based on each disorder. RESULTS: Results demonstrated
              that adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders were more
              popular than their peers without disruptive behavior disorders
              (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). Friendship was also more likely
              between two adolescents both with or both without disruptive
              behavior disorders (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), demonstrating peer
              homophily. There was no evidence that anxiety disorders were
              related to adolescent peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
              from this study suggest that disruptive behavior disorders may be
              socially rewarded (e.g., peer popularity) and socially clustered
              (e.g., homophily), whereas anxiety disorders show no such trends.
              Thus, intervention efforts must account for the peer social
              status that may be gained from engaging in disruptive behavior
              during this developmental period. Further, given that similarity
              in DBD status is associated with an increased likelihood of
              friendship, adolescents are likely to be surrounded by peers who
              reinforce their behaviors.",

              network from the 2015 outbreak in rural Indiana with 1000
              networks generated by an agent-based network model with
              approximately the same number of individuals (n = 420) and ties
              between them (n = 913). We introduced an initial HIV infection
              into the simulated networks and compared the subsequent epidemic
              behavior (e.g., cumulative HIV infections over 5 years). The
              model was able to produce networks with largely comparable
              characteristics and total numbers of incident HIV infections.
              Although the model was unable to produce networks with comparable
              cohesiveness (where the observed network had a transitivity value
              35.7 standard deviations from the mean of the simulated
              networks), the structural variability of the simulated networks
              allowed for investigation into their potential facilitation of
              HIV transmission. These findings emphasize the need for continued
              development of injection network simulation studies in tandem
              with empirical data collection to further investigate how network
              characteristics played a role in this and future outbreaks.",

              was founded in February 2012 as a disease-specific hashtag for
              patients with brain tumor. OBJECTIVE: To understand \#BTSM's role
              as a patient support system, we describe user descriptors,
              growth, interaction, and content sharing. METHODS: We analyzed
              all tweets containing \#BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur
              Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined
              user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. We
              created a network plot with all publicly available retweets
              involving \#BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their
              connections to other users. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, 59,764
              unique users participated in \#BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. The
              yearly volume of \#BTSM tweets increased by 264.57\% from 16,394
              in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with \#BTSM constantly trending in the
              top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet
              chats. Patient advocates generated the most \#BTSM tweets
              (33.13\%), while advocacy groups, caregivers, doctors, and
              researchers generated 7.01\%, 4.63\%, 3.86\%, and 3.37\%,
              respectively. Physician use, although still low, has increased
              over time. The 2018 network plot of retweets including \#BTSM
              identifies a number of key stakeholders from the patient
              advocate, patient organization, and medical researcher domains
              and reveals the extent of their reach to other users.
              CONCLUSIONS: From its start in 2012, \#BTSM has grown
              exponentially over time. We believe its growth suggests its
              potential as a global source of brain tumor information on
              Twitter for patients, advocates, patient organizations as well as
              health care professionals and researchers.",

  abstract = "Livestock movements are a common pathway for the spread
              infectious diseases in a population. An understanding of
              livestock movement patterns is needed to understand national
              transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during
              epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that
              helps to describe the relationships among individuals and the
              implications of those relationships. We used SNA to describe the
              contact structure of livestock movements throughout the
              contiguous U.S. from April 1(st), 2015 to March 31(st), 2016. We
              describe 4 network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and
              small ruminant. Livestock movement data were sourced from
              Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) while
              county-level farm demographic data were from the National
              Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described
              networks, nodes are represented by counties and arcs by shipments
              between nodes; the networks were weighted based on the number of
              shipments between nodes. For the analyses, movement data were
              aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. Measures
              of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification
              of trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the
              study period, a total of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef
              cattle movements accounted for 63 \% of all movements. At least
              70 \% of U.S. counties were present in each of the networks, but
              the density of arcs was less than 2\% in all networks. In the
              beef cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly
              correlated (0.8) with the number of beef cows per county while
              for the dairy cattle network a strong correlation (>0.86) was
              found with the number of dairy cattle per km(2) at the county
              level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large
              communities (50 counties or more per community), and were
              geographically clustered except for the communities in the small
              ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses can help to
              understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle,
              dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants. They may also be used
              in conjunction with simulation modeling to evaluate spread of
              highly infectious disease such as foot-and-mouth disease at the
              national level and to evaluate the application of intervention
              strategies.",

              Hungerford, Laura L and Rideout, Bruce A and Fowler, James H",
  abstract = "The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of
              avian mycobacteriosis spread through a social network.
              Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of
              connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether
              this pattern can distinguish between different sources of
              infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals
              nested in a larger population of birds that were closely
              monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014).
              A retrospective cohort study design and social network
              connectivity were used to estimate the association between
              exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis.
              Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and
              network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over
              discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable
              longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined
              whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and
              indirectly-connected, was associated with development of
              mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed
              an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio =
              2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48-3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were
              directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another
              infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a
              positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was
              independently associated with an increased risk of
              mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11-2.19). This
              association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect
              contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never
              had contact with the subject of interest or its environment.
              Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type
              of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis.
              Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to
              develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and
              those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of
              the contact (same species versus different species) were also
              significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were
              sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation
              time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the
              social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We
              provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some
              of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility
              based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when
              large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation
              efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be
              effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while
              enhancing population sustainability.",

              had experienced at least one physical or sexual violence after
              their 15. Taking into account the severe health consequences, the
              Emergency Department (ED), may offer an opportunity to recognize
              when an aggression is part of the spectrum of violence. This
              study applies Social Network analysis (SNA) to ED data in the
              Lazio region with the objective to identify patterns of
              diagnoses, within all the ED accesses of women experiencing an
              aggression, that are signals for gender-based violence against
              women. We aim to develop a risk assessment tool for ED
              professionals in order to strength their ability to manage
              victims of violence. METHODS: A cohort of 124,691 women aged
              15-70 with an ED visit for aggression between 2003 and 2015 was
              selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and
              traumas was reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses
              and traumas, including also 9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA
              community detection algorithms and network centrality measures
              were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly associated
              to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the
              capability of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of
              having an history of violence. Model results were summed up into
              a risk chart. RESULTS: Among women experiencing an aggression,
              SNA identified four communities representing specific
              violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a
              central role in the violence network were alcohol or substance
              abuse, pregnancy-related conditions and psychoses. These
              high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 20\% of
              our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and
              predictive power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified
              through the SNA are meaningful in the violence recognition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a
              first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access
              is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women.
              Increasing the available number of predictors, such procedures
              may be proven to support ED staff in identifying early signs of
              violence to adequately support the victims and mitigate the
              harms.",

              specifically developments that leverage the environmental and
              social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including
              infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require
              capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or
              regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward
              green stormwater infrastructure have been shepherded by networks
              of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from
              governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is,
              not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal
              agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal
              hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed
              the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of
              these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance
              networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and
              characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI
              for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and
              administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to
              individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management
              professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected
              network data on individual relationships, including collaboration
              and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on
              peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings
              suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and
              individual position within the network-specifically, betweenness
              centrality and openness-defined and likely supported leaders in
              the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this
              non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to
              be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women,
              not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on
              single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of
              this research suggest that informal environmental governance
              networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ
              substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of
              organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and
              regional authorities grappling with complex environmental

              leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic
              unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and
              political actors, paralleled by the introduction of
              country-specific containment measures and the growing
              politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained
              present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became
              more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network
              communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification
              and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information
              from international health organizations or scientific authorities
              to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged
              time. These results may have implications for information
              dissemination along the unfolding of long-term events like
              epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.",

              METHODS: This study employs a social network analysis for Twitter
              in New York and California. RESULTS: National key players play an
              important role in New York, whereas regional key players exert a
              significant impact on California. Some key players, such as the
              US President, play an essential role in both New York and
              California. Hispanic key players play a crucial role in
              California. Each group is more likely to show communication
              networks within groups in New York, whereas it is more apt to

              health problem and identifying their determinants is a priority.
              Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of
              social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A
              growing number of studies have used social network analysis to
              examine how social network characteristics influence adult
              alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been
              systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper
              systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network
              analysis to assess the influence of social network
              characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS: A
              literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of
              Science databases and a review of the reference lists of
              retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers
              independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further
              screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their
              eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged
              eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among
              young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up
              visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The
              objectives and methods of the included studies were
              heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically
              significant association between a social network characteristic
              and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network
              members drinking behaviors were associated with participants'
              drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION: In young adults,
              among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted,
              with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be
              associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across
              methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the
              relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups,
              and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks
              appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young
              adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help
              reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.",

              which exposure to self-harm related content may occur. N = 477
              participants completed an online study, including questions
              regarding lifetime history of self-harm thoughts and behaviours
              and the frequency with which they had been exposed to self-harm

              were estimated using graphical LASSO and extended Bayesian
              information criterion. Bootstrapping revealed that exposure
              mediums with a direct connection to self-harm thoughts and
              behaviours were the internet (rrp = .34, 95\% CI [.26, .42]) and
              in-passing 'miscellaneous' exposure (rrp = .14, 95\% CI [.00,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy
              theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic
              is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are ``empty.''
              Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases
              the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice
              about social distancing and other public health interventions.
              Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it
              is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of
              misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. OBJECTIVE: This
              study set out to evaluate the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy
              theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind
              it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which
              online sources of information were used as evidence to support
              the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the
              network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread
              of such a conspiracy theory in the future. METHODS: Twitter data
              related to the \#FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and
              analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from
              April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and
              11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify
              accounts with a higher probability of being bots. RESULTS: The
              most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary
              citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit
              supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most
              linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a
              verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more
              influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated
              accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network.
              CONCLUSIONS: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can
              be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing
              misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their
              efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation.

              transmission. Social network analysis (SNA) generates data on
              hyperlocal social-demographic structures that contribute to
              disease transmission. METHODS: We collected social contact data
              in five villages and built SNA-informed village-specific
              stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar. A
              name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact
              networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by
              snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were
              aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and
              individual-level characteristics determining contact formation
              and structure were identified by fitting an exponential random
              graph model (ERGM), which formed the basis of the contact
              structure and model dynamics. Models were calibrated and used to
              evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and community resiliency
              to foreign TB introduction. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-village SNA
              showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with transitivity
              (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43. Active
              case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active
              TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all
              village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and
              without specific interventions, networks A and B showed
              resilience to both active and latent TB reintroduction, while
              Network C, the village network with the highest transitivity,
              lacked resiliency to reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence
              of 2\% and a TB mortality rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one
              new contagious infection post hypothetical elimination.
              CONCLUSION: In remote Madagascar, SNA-informed models suggest
              that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease (active TB)
              prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB) burden
              remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction
              decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down''
              population level TB models would most likely miss this difference
              between small communities. SNA bridges large-scale

              temporal changes in their probability of being exposed to
              SARS-CoV-2 via mobility. METHODS: We included 652 COVID-19 cases
              and utilized Exponential Random Graph Models to build six social

              probability of being exposed to a COVID-19 case in Hong Kong

              3.38\% in early 2020 to 5.78\% in early 2022. While domestic

              cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was
              used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual
              farm and market level to help identify important nodes.
              Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed.
              Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different
              groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for
              mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The
              network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6
              million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units
              participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating.
              Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in
              shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within
              provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating
              61\% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are
              involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions
              with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical
              clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node
              characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and
              backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single
              outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION:
              Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal
              characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable
              information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective
              surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where
              efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and
              patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission
              models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of
              emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak in a major
              referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam led to 7664 patients and
              staff being sent into lockdown for 2 weeks, and more than 52,200
              persons across 49 provinces being quarantined. We assessed
              SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest
              hospital outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA).
              METHODS: We constructed a directed relational network and
              calculated network metrics for 'degree', 'betweenness',
              'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand
              individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network
              components and modularity to identify sub-network structures with
              disproportionately big effects. RESULTS: We detected 68
              connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 27 (58.7\%) were
              ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2\%) caregivers, 6 (13\%) patients
              and 2 (4.4\%) nurses. Among the 10 most important cases selected
              by each SNA network metric, transmission dynamics clustered in 17
              cases, of whom 12 (70.6\%) cases were ancillary support staff.
              Ancillary support staff also constituted 71.1\% of cases in the
              dominant sub-network and 68.8\% of cases in the three largest
              sub-communities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified non-clinical
              ancillary support staff, who are responsible for room service and
              food distribution in hospital wards in Vietnam, as a group with
              disproportionally big impacts on transmission dynamics during
              this outbreak. Our findings call for a holistic approach to
              nosocomial outbreak prevention and response that includes both
              clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. Our work also shows the
              potential of SNA as a complementary outbreak investigation method
              to better understand infection patterns in hospitals and similar

              Networking Platforms: Cross-sectional Study",
  author   = "Chiou, Piao-Yi and Hung, Chien-Ching and Chen, Chien-Yu",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) who undergo voluntary
              HIV counseling and testing (VCT) often report condomless anal
              sexual intercourse, having many sexual partners, and being
              exposed to risky sexual networks. Limited research has discussed
              the application of motivational interviewing and convenience
              referral platforms to facilitate the referral of sexual partners
              for HIV testing among MSM. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
              evaluate the effects of VCT referral by sexual partners through
              social networking platforms and the test results after elicited
              interviews with MSM; compare the characteristics and risk
              behaviors among MSM tested without referral, index subjects, and
              referred sexual partners; and explore unknown sexual affiliations
              through visualizing and quantifying the social network graph.
              METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Purposeful sampling
              was used to recruit index subjects from a community HIV screening
              station frequented by MSM in Taipei City on Friday and Saturday
              nights. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit sexual
              partners. Partner-elicited interviews were conducted by trained
              staff before VCT to motivate MSM to become index subjects and
              refer sexual partners via the Line app, or to disclose the
              accounts and profiles of sexual partners on relevant social
              networking platforms. Referred sexual partners received rapid HIV
              testing, and the recruitment process was repeated until leads
              were exhausted. RESULTS: After the interviews, 28.2\% (75/266) of
              MSM were successfully persuaded to become index subjects in the
              first wave, referring 127 sexual partners via the Line app for
              rapid HIV testing and disclosing 40 sexual partners. The index
              subjects and tested sexual partners had more sexual partners
              (F(2)=3.83, P=.02), more frequent anal intercourse (F(2)=10.10,
              P<.001), and higher percentages of those who had not previously
              received HIV testing ($\chi$(2)(1)=6.1, P=.047) compared with MSM
              tested without referrals. The new HIV-seropositivity rate among
              tested sexual partners was 2.4\%, which was higher than the rate
              in the other 2 groups. The social network analysis revealed the
              following 4 types of sexual affiliation: chain, Y, star, and
              complicated. Among the HIV-negative sexual partners, 26.9\%
              (43/160) had sexual affiliations with HIV-positive nodes, and
              40\% (10/25) were untested sexual partners with a direct sexual
              affiliation with an HIV-positive node. Four transmission bridges
              were found in the network graph. CONCLUSIONS: Partner-elicited
              interviews can effectively promote referral for HIV testing and
              case identification via Line, and can clarify unknown sexual
              affiliations of MSM to facilitate the development of a tailored
              prevention program. Social network analysis is needed for an
              insightful understanding of the different network structures.",

              cognitive performance has been less investigated in
              low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC) and the presence of
              depression as a moderator on this association has not been
              examined. The authors examined the associations of social
              isolation and perceived loneliness with cognitive performance in
              the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. METHODS: In this
              cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a
              composite score including marital status, social contact, and
              social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive
              performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and
              temporal orientation tests. Linear and logistic regressions were
              adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors
              added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social
              isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured
              through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale,
              modified these associations. RESULTS: Among 6,986 participants
              (mean age = 62.1 $\pm$ 9.2 years), higher levels of social
              connections were associated with better global cognitive
              performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness
              was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34;
              -0.18). Interactions of depressive symptoms with social
              connections scores were found on memory z-score and with
              loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker
              association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition
              among those with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In a large
              sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were
              associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly,
              depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations.

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur
              commonly in children and have been related to bullying
              victimization. However, whether bullying perpetration, peer
              rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory
              experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer
              nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration
              and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated
              with future hallucinatory experiences. METHODS: This prospective
              study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study.
              Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were
              assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a
              social network analysis, we estimated social positions within
              peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization
              was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory
              experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted
              for sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Higher levels of
              bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an
              increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI
              1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and
              bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory
              experiences three years later than children who were not involved
              in bullying (OR(bully) = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045;
              OR(bully-victim) = 1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012).
              Unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks, but not
              peer acceptance networks, were associated with an increased risk
              for hallucinatory experiences (OR(peer rejection) = 1.24, 95\% CI
              1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Using peer
              reports, we observed that bullies and socially rejected children
              have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory experiences in
              pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a victim of
              bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable for

              performed to organize a collaborative initiative to develop a CPS
              aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in Andaluc{\'\i}a
              (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders,
              differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder
              relationships. METHOD: Stakeholders were identified using the
              snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders
              and analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online
              web-based questionnaire was sent to 186 stakeholders.
              Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest and
              attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3)
              capacity to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for
              involvement; (5) concerns; (6) whom they considered a key
              stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they had with
              other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive
              qualitative content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis
              and social network analysis. RESULTS: Of the 186 stakeholders
              approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated. The identification process
              yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or
              collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders
              were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most
              participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were
              willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public
              health and science were the main driving interests. A
              collaboration network existed between the 96 stakeholders.

              system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing
              cardiovascular disease. A large array of stakeholders was
              identified and analyzed, and a group of critical stakeholders

              mathematical models have been proposed to investigate the
              inflection point (IP) and the spread pattern of COVID-19.
              However, no researchers have applied social network analysis
              (SNA) to cluster their characteristics. We aimed to illustrate
              the use of SNA to identify the spread clusters of COVID-19.
              Cumulative numbers of infected cases (CNICs) in countries/regions
              were downloaded from GitHub. The CNIC patterns were extracted
              from SNA based on CNICs between countries/regions. The item
              response model (IRT) was applied to create a general predictive
              model for each country/region. The IP days were obtained from the
              IRT model. The location parameters in continents, China, and the
              United States were compared. The results showed that (1) three
              clusters (255, n = 51, 130, and 74 in patterns from Eastern Asia

              counterparts, and (3) an online dashboard was used to display the
              clusters along with IP days for each country/region.
              Spatiotemporal spread patterns can be clustered using SNA and
              correlation coefficients (CCs). A dashboard with spread clusters

              theories, and magical cures had ever been shared and spread among
              the general public at an alarming rate, causing public panic and
              increasing the complexity and difficulty of social management.
              Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the
              driving factors of the social rumors during the COVID-19
              pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 1,537 rumors collected
              from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided the
              sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all
              kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation
              analysis were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics
              and the spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of the
              rumors, and the four stages of development were also divided
              according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key
              driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network
              analysis method was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode
              network characteristics, the generation driver-rumor 2-mode
              network characteristics, and the spreading driver-rumor 2-mode
              characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the
              number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as
              the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the
              importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social
              stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the
              four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating
              Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results
              of rumor drivers indicated that panic psychology and the lag in
              releasing government information played an essential role in
              driving the generation and spread of rumors. The public's low
              scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing
              rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors.
              CONCLUSION: The study revealed the mechanism of rumors. In
              addition, studies involving rumors on different emergencies and
              social platforms are warranted to enrich the findings.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Low-wage dormitory-dwelling migrant workers in
              Singapore were disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease
              2019 (COVID-19) infection. This was attributed to communal living
              in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of
              inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the
              roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission.
              The study examined the networks of non-work-related activities
              among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit
              strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A
              population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers
              across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social
              ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related
              variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network
              questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented
              based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the
              structures and positions of networks between workers and visit
              areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure
              was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and
              visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the
              most frequently visited for essential services of grocery
              shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly
              for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the
              highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to
              COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Social and geospatial networks of migrant
              workers should be considered in the implementation of lockdown
              exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living
              conditions and monitoring systems. Essential services, like
              remittance and grocery shopping at affordable prices, need to be
              provided near to dormitories to minimize excess gatherings.",

  abstract = "The modelling of disease spread is crucial to the farming
              industry and policy makers. In some of these industries,
              excellent data exist on animal movements, along with the networks
              that these movements create, and allow researchers to model
              spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing
              System is an online recording system for cattle births, deaths
              and between-herd movements in the United Kingdom and is an
              excellent resource for any researchers interested in networks or
              modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system.
              Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know
              how much change is occurring in a network, to help judge the
              merit of using historical data within a modelling context. This
              article uses the data to construct weighted directed monthly
              movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and
              2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of
              the network has changed. Substantial changes in network structure
              may influence policy-makers directly or may influence models
              built upon the network data, and these in turn could impact
              policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13
              network metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as
              total number of nodes with movements and total movements, through
              to metrics to describe the network (e.g., Giant weakly and
              strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per node
              (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that
              there is a statistically significant effect of the period
              (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the values of nine of the 13 network
              metrics. For example median total degree decreased by 19\%. In
              addition to examining networks for two time periods, two updates
              of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement
              data stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates.
              Examination of these updates shows that there are small decreases
              in problem movements (such as animals leaving slaughterhouses)
              and therefore evidence of historical data being improved between
              updates. In combination with the significant effect of period on
              many of the network metrics, the modification of data between
              updates provides further evidence that the most recent available
              data should be used for network modelling. This will ensure that
              the most representative descriptions of the network are available
              to provide accurate modelling results to best inform policy
              makers.",

              key developmental proficiencies during adolescence. Understanding
              how immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents are developing a
              sense of their national identity and the role that this plays in
              how they select their friends and are influenced by their friends
              is essential for developing a more comprehensive understanding of
              adolescent development in context. The current study used
              longitudinal social network analysis to examine the interplay of
              national identity development and friendship network dynamics
              among immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents in Greece (N =
              1252; 46\% female). All youth with higher national identity
              resolution (i.e., youth's sense of clarity regarding their
              identity as a member of Greek society) in Grade 8 were more often
              nominated as a friend in Grade 9. During the transition from 8th
              to 9th grade, all youth became more similar to their nominated
              friends in terms of their Greek national identity exploration
              (i.e., degree to which they had engaged in activities to learn
              more about Greek society). During the transition from 7th to 8th
              grade, there was significant variability in peer selection on
              national identity exploration and resolution between immigrant
              and non-immigrant youth. Specifically, immigrant youth
              demonstrated selection effects consistent with notions of
              homophily, such that they were more likely to nominate peers in
              8th grade whose levels of national identity exploration and
              resolution were similar to their own when in 7th grade. In
              contrast, non-immigrant youth preferred peers in 8th grade with
              low levels of national identity exploration (regardless of their
              own levels of exploration in 7th grade) and peers whose levels of
              national identity resolution in 8th grade were different from
              their own in 7th grade (e.g., non-immigrant youth who reported
              high national identity resolution in 7th grade were more likely
              to nominate peers who had low national identity resolution in 8th
              grade). There were no differences by immigrant status in peer
              influence, suggesting that the significant peer influence effects
              that emerged during the transition from 8th to 9th grade in which
              youth became more similar to their friends in national identity
              exploration may reflect a universal process. These results chart
              new directions in understanding contemporary youth development in
              context by showing that adolescents develop their national
              identity and friendships in tandem and that certain aspects of
              this process may vary by immigrant status.",

              theory of complex adaptive systems. METHODS: The study employed
              time-slicing techniques and social network analysis to translate
              the dynamic evolution of information collaboration into a
              stage-based static representation. Data were collected from
              January to April 2020, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Python
              was used to amass data from diverse sources including government
              portals, public commentary, social organizations, market updates,
              and healthcare institutions. Post data collection, the
              structures, collaboration objectives, and participating entities
              within each time slice were explored using social network
              analysis. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the law of evolution
              for information collaboration in public health emergencies
              primarily starts with small-scale collaboration, grows to
              full-scale in the middle phase, and then reverts to small-scale
              in the final phase. The network's complexity increases initially
              and then gradually decreases, mirroring changes in collaboration
              tasks, objectives, and strategies. DISCUSSION: The dynamic
              pattern of information collaboration highlighted in this study
              offers valuable insights for enhancing emergency management

              assessments as part of the Social Networks Among Appalachian

              interviewer-administered questionnaires that collected social
              network data via free-listing at baseline and six-month
              intervals. At visit 5, after free-listing, interviewers prompted
              participants with the names of previously reported alters. We
              used modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating
              equations to identify individual- and relationship-level

              centrality, bridging, density, mean degree, transitivity,
              cliques, and 2-cores). RESULTS: Relationships reported only after
              prompting were more likely to be immediate family (Adjusted
              Prevalence Ratio [APR]:1.29; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI]:

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The relationship between smoking and adolescents' peer
              relationships is complex, with studies showing increased risk of
              smoking for adolescents of both very high and very low social
              position. A key question is whether the impact of social position
              on smoking depends on an adolescent's level of coping motives
              (i.e., their desire to use smoking to mitigate negative affect).
              METHOD: We assessed how social position predicts nicotine
              dependence in a longitudinal sample (N = 3,717; 44.8\% male; mean
              age = 13.41 years) of adolescent lifetime smokers measured
              between 6th and 12th grades. Using both social network analysis
              and multilevel modeling, we assessed this question at the
              between-person and within-person level, hypothesizing that
              within-person decreases in social position would lead to
              increased risk of nicotine dependence among those with high
              levels of coping motives. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses,
              only interactions with the between-person measures of social
              position were found, with a slight negative relationship at low
              levels of coping motives. In addition, the main effect of coping
              motives was considerably stronger than that of social position at
              the between-person level, and social position had no significant
              within-person main effect on nicotine dependence risk.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adolescents with higher
              overall levels of social position among their peers may have
              slightly decreased risk for nicotine dependence, but only when
              coping motives are low. Counter to expectations, higher levels of
              nicotine dependence risk were not linked to fluctuations in
              social position.",

              movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease
              circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our
              model utilized equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks,
              between-farm horse movements, and spatial landscape data from
              2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and the movement of
              horses between farms with climate variables that foster
              conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a
              spatially explicit model that allows the effect of the climate
              variables on EIAV occurrence to vary through space (i.e.,
              non-stationary). Our results identified important areas in which
              in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections
              and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as
              having high 56 (11.3\%), medium 48 (9.66\%), and low 393 (79.1\%)

              areas, altogether representing 68.68\% of all animal movements.
              Meanwhile, 9.48\% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20\% were
              within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37\% of the animals entering
              low-risk areas came from high-risk areas. On the other hand,
              4.91\% of the animals in the high-risk areas came from low- and
              medium-risk areas. Our results demonstrate that animal movements

              before issuing animal movement permits, thus potentially reducing
              the chances of reintroducing infection into areas of low risk.",

              association between social network characteristics and prevalent
              tuberculosis infection among residents (aged $\geq$15 years) of 9
              rural communities in Eastern Uganda. Social contacts named during
              a census were used to create community-specific nonhousehold
              social networks. We evaluated whether social network structure
              and characteristics of first-degree contacts (sex, human
              immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, tuberculosis infection) were
              associated with revalent tuberculosis infection (positive
              tuberculin skin test [TST] result) after adjusting for
              individual-level risk factors (age, sex, HIV status, tuberculosis
              contact, wealth, occupation, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin
              [BCG] vaccination) with targeted maximum likelihood estimation.
              RESULTS: Among 3 335 residents sampled for TST, 32\% had a
              positive TST results and 4\% reported a tuberculosis contact. The
              social network contained 15 328 first-degree contacts. Persons
              with the most network centrality (top 10\%) (adjusted risk ratio,
              1.3 [95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.1]) and the most (top 10\%)
              male contacts (1.5 [1.3-1.9]) had a higher risk of prevalent
              tuberculosis, than those in the remaining 90\%. People with
              $\geq$1 contact with HIV (adjusted risk ratio, 1.3 [95\%
              confidence interval, 1.1-1.6]) and $\geq$2 contacts with
              tuberculosis infection were more likely to have tuberculosis
              themselves (2.6 [ 95\% confidence interval: 2.2-2.9]).
              CONCLUSIONS: Social networks with higher centrality, more men,
              contacts with HIV, and tuberculosis infection were positively
              associated with tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis transmission
              within measurable social networks may explain prevalent

              Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New
              Media, and the central government response in this pandemic.
              RESULTS: Findings show that the Chinese central government does
              not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk
              management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up
              governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this
              process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced
              with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the
              central government, public participation firstly creates
              ``participation'' with the authority of the media, forms public

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that successful assessment and care
              for frail individuals requires integrated and collaborative care
              and support across and within settings. Understanding the care
              and support networks of a frail individual could therefore prove
              useful in understanding need and designing support. This study
              explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling
              older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of
              likely frailty, by describing and comparing the individuals'
              networks as perceived by themselves and as perceived by
              healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A
              convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare
              professionals were recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls
              Group' programme within North-West London. Individual (i.e., one
              on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted to establish an
              individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social
              network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural
              characteristics of the networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic
              analysis aided data interpretation. RESULTS: All reported care
              and support networks showed a high contribution level from family
              and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported
              networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the
              'frequency' and 'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare
              professional reported networks, the reported frequency of
              interaction as detailed in patient records was used to ascertain
              'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the
              importance of the role of informal carers and friends along with
              healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with
              frailty. There was congruence in the makeup of 'patient' and
              'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of
              helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight
              the multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which
              could be targeted by healthcare professionals to support the care

              common health problems affecting patients in human and animal
              hospitals. Herein, we hypothesised that HAIs could be spread
              through human and animal movement, contact with veterinary
              medical supplies, equipment, or instruments. We used a
              combination of social network analysis and genotyping techniques

              Escherichia coli as a marker. This study was implemented in the

              ward of a small animal hospital. We conducted an observational
              study used for key player determination (or key node
              identification), then observed the selected key nodes twice with
              a one-month interval. Next, surface swabs of key nodes and their

  abstract = "Background: Community coalitions often lead and coordinate
              ``whole-of-community'' childhood obesity prevention
              interventions. A growing body of work suggests that coalition
              network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and
              advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This
              study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition
              networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We
              administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot
              whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017).
              Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their
              nominated discussion partners (``first-degree alters'') related
              to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter
              respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties'
              interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were
              assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and
              exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included
              558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations,
              parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size
              and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network
              (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest
              proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently
              (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak
              intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected
              (1\%-3\% of possible ties observed) and most and least
              centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time,
              ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within
              community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving
              membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources,
              ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention
              messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have
              supported more equal participation and control over intervention
              efforts. Future research should assess generalizability of
              network patterns, network influences on implementation processes,
              and possible network interventions.",

              with outcomes (illness severity or death) among hospitalized
              patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Data
              were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea Disease
              Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical
              and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with
              COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in
              Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic
              regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with
              COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was
              the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen
              treatment not needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or
              death. RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the
              fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio
              [OR], 2.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and
              chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95\% CI,
              1.35 to 7.52) were significantly associated with disease
              severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95\% CI, 2.00 to 14.31), heart failure

              were associated with an increased risk of death. Asthma and
              hypertension showed statistically insignificant associations with
              an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases
              contribute differently to the severity of COVID-19. To
              efficiently allocate limited medical resources, underlying
              comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly CKD,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social
              media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during
              public health crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of
              rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the
              structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well
              as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This
              study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor
              rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect
              on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on
              Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the
              COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the
              information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS:
              We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl
              rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January
              23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis,
              sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical
              analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was
              an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes
              when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested
              the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and
              the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the
              results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive
              judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from
              three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and
              sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber
              effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting
              mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and
              the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our
              results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber
              effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to
              like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained
              significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and
              sharing, and incivility. We found that online users'
              information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and
              information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative
              sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an
              echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic,
              interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on
              interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several
              suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to
              achieve better rumor rebuttal.",

              the adolescent. In this phase, a group of friends becomes
              increasingly important. Alcohol is present in different social

              network, self-efficacy, and alcohol consumption in adolescents.
              METHODS: We used an online platform with validated self-reported

              adolescents aged between 16 and 18, from different educational

              CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy is established as a predictor of
              coping and not consuming alcohol and adolescence as a crucial
              moment to implement prevention strategies. Social Network

              organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs continued to maintain a certain
              degree of activity. Their dynamic processes showed the
              characteristics of diversification rather than homogeneity. The

              between health workers. The structure of their information

              classify information exchange networks in primary care for
              patients with chronic diseases in Germany. METHODS: A
              cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021. As
              part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study
              focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding
              patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD)
              and chronic heart failure (CHF). Social network analysis was
              applied to determine the number of connections, density and
              centralization for each of the health conditions for each of the
              practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed
              typologies of information exchange networks in primary care
              practices. RESULTS: We included 153 health workers from 40
              practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social
              network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures
              were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected
              networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with
              medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy
              and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low
              hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17
              for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions,
              information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team
              members. Information exchange outside the family practice took
              place mainly with nurses and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              identified four types of information exchange structures, which
              provides a practical tool for management and improvement in
              primary care. Some practices had few information transfer

              Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in
              that 80 \% of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus
              acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were
              found. The results also showed that premises were highly
              connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low
              levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 \% of the
              paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which
              accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the
              use of time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate
              potential transmission pathways and outbreak sizes. Compared to
              static networks, the application of temporal network approaches
              was more suitable to capture the dynamics of pig trade and should

              from developing countries is limited. This study aimed to
              identify patient-sharing networks among physicians in China and
              explore the effect of attributes of physician networks on
              healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis
              was undertaken based on healthcare claims from Urban Employee
              Basic Medical Insurance Data spanning the years 2015 to 2018. We
              identified patients with hypertension and modeled physician
              patient-sharing networks using social network analysis.
              Relationships among physicians were further quantified using
              network measures. We fitted a log-linear model to examine the
              association between networks and healthcare at the physician
              level. RESULTS: 29,321 patients, seen by 3,429 physicians from 57
              hospitals in one eastern city of China were included. Physicians
              were connected to 21 other physicians (threshold = 1 shared
              patients) or 7 other physicians (threshold = 4, 6, or 8 shared
              patients). Degree and centrality measures of physicians at
              primary care facilities were significantly lower than those at
              secondary or tertiary hospitals (p < 0.001). The links between
              physicians at different hospital grades were weak and patients
              tended to flow among physicians at the same hospital grade.
              Compared with a low closeness centrality, a medium level was
              associated with fewer hospitalization costs and days, and high
              closeness centrality was accompanied by a sharper decrease (all P
              < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians were located in
              peripheral positions in China, and the links between primary care
              facilities and higher-grade hospitals were still weak.
              Characteristics of physicians' networks and the position of
              physicians in the network were associated with spending and
              utilization of services, but not all associations were in the

              health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak
              periods. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using
              secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized
              cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by
              age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases
              and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms,
              roommates, and health care providers over time. RESULTS: Matched
              controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay,
              mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care
              providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates

              have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational
              context. Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based
              on relationships. However, there is a lack of studies that
              analyse the behaviour of university students based on their
              social structure in the context of a pandemic. This information
              could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective
              responses to adversities. The Social Network Analysis (SNA)
              method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.
              The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour
              of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic
              with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive
              cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public
              University, Le{\'o}n, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November
              2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of
              residence. The data were collected from a database created
              specifically at the university to ``track'' contacts in the
              COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. We applied the SNA for the analysis
              of the data. The leadership on the university residence was
              measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed
              using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.
              Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels
              of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection. The
              results were statistically significant between the centrality in
              the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most
              leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three
              students had the key player structure in the network. Networking
              behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be
              related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be
              described on the basis of aspects of similarities between
              students, and even leaders connecting the cohabitation
              sub-networks. In this context, Social Network Analysis could be
              considered as a methodological approach for future network

              2512 PWID in New Delhi, India were recruited in 2017-19 using a
              sociometric network design. Sampling was initiated with 10
              indexes who recruited named injection partners (people who they
              injected with in the prior month). Each recruit then recruited
              their named injection partners following the same process with
              cross-network linkages established by biometric data.
              Participants responded to a survey, including information on

              with HIV/HCV infection were identified using logistic regression.
              RESULTS: The median age was 26; 99\% were male. Baseline HIV
              prevalence was 37.0\% and 46.8\% were actively infected with HCV
              (HCV RNA positive). The odds of prevalent HIV and active HCV
              infection decreased with each additional degree of separation
              from an infected alter (HIV AOR: 0.87; HCV AOR: 0.90) and
              increased among those who injected at a specific venue (HIV AOR:
              1.50; HCV AOR: 1.69) independent of individual-level factors

              HIV and HCV infection and a highly interconnected injection and
              spatial network structure. Incorporating network and spatial data

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Social media, an essential source of public access
              to information regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, has a significant
              effect on the transmission of information regarding the COVID-19
              vaccines and helps the public gain correct insights into the
              effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. The forwarding
              behavior of social media users on posts concerned with COVID-19
              vaccine topics can rapidly disseminate vaccine information in a
              short period, which has a significant effect on transmission and
              helps the public access relevant information. However, the
              factors of social media users' forwarding posts are still
              uncertain thus far. In this paper, we investigated the factors of
              the forwarding COVID-19 vaccines Weibo posts on Chinese social
              media and verified the correlation between social network
              characteristics, Weibo textual sentiment characteristics, and
              post forwarding. METHODS: This paper used data mining, machine
              learning, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and
              regression analysis. Using `` (COVID-19 vaccine)'' as the
              keyword, we used data mining to crawl 121,834 Weibo posts on Sina
              Weibo from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2021. Weibo posts not closely
              correlated with the topic of the COVID-19 vaccines were filtered
              out using machine learning. In the end, 3,158 posts were used for
              data analysis. The proportions of positive sentiment and negative
              sentiment in the textual of Weibo posts were calculated through
              sentiment analysis. On that basis, the sentiment characteristics
              of Weibo posts were determined. The social network
              characteristics of information transmission on the COVID-19
              vaccine topic were determined through social network analysis.
              The correlation between social network characteristics, sentiment
              characteristics of the text, and the forwarding volume of posts
              was verified through regression analysis. RESULTS: The results
              suggest that there was a significant positive correlation between
              the degree of posting users in the social network structure and
              the amount of forwarding. The relationship between the closeness
              centrality and the forwarding volume was significantly positive.
              The betweenness centrality was significantly positively
              correlated with the forwarding volume. There was no significant
              relationship between the number of posts containing more positive
              sentiments and the forwarding volume of posts. There was a
              significant positive correlation between the number of Weibo
              posts containing more negative sentiments and the forwarding
              volume. CONCLUSION: According to the characteristics of users,
              COVID-19 vaccine posts from opinion leaders, ``gatekeepers,'' and
              users with high-closeness centrality are more likely to be
              reposted. Users with these characteristics should be valued for
              their important role in disseminating information about COVID-19
              vaccines. In addition, the sentiment contained in the Weibo post
              is an important factor influencing the public to forward vaccine
              posts. Special attention should be paid to the negative
              sentimental tendency contained in this post on Weibo to mitigate
              the negative impact of the information epidemic and improve the
              transmission effect of COVID-19 vaccine information.",

              Such a network could prove valuable during public health
              emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the
              United States were tied together in an informal network to share
              information and advice about innovative community health
              practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and
              February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD
              leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice.
              We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices
              informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based
              practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We
              used a social network analysis program to assess answers.
              RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network
              appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were
              repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples
              (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold
              these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners).
              Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed
              performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and
              boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase
              the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption
              of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new
              public health practices, programs, or policies may find our
              results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.",

              and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with respect to the
              EHE plan. METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A
              total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free
              social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network

              initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives);
              seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2
              positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes
              across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people
              high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI\% 5.699,
              115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens
              ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model
              higher association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness
              among those tested negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV
              intervention in the past 12 months with those tested positive
              ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: The network visualization

              success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network
              strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest
              behavioral supplements for DC's HIV planning activities. As part

              impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on
              peoples' HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions

              well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). After
              restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the
              top 10 \% of degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by
              nearly 50 \% in the network, whereas the number of pigs was
              reduced by 94.0 \% when movement restrictions were implemented in
              areas with the top 50 \% of degree centrality. Observed network
              metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking
              in November and December. Generalized linear models showed that
              the size of the human population and per capita gross domestic
              product were the most important socioeconomic drivers of pig
              movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a
              small-world network in which the introduction and spread of
              diseases may be quicker. More human, material, and financial
              resources should be allocated to areas with higher centrality.
              Swine movements were seasonal, and the inspection and quarantine
              work should be reinforced in the fourth quarter, especially in
              November and December. Pig movements were more active in areas
              with larger populations and advanced economy, and stricter
              supervision in these areas should be implemented. Our findings
              contribute to understanding the movement of pigs and the
              associated influencing factors in a big pig producing province in
              China, and the supervision strategies proposed in this study can
              be extended to other regions in China if proved to be viable.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical
              diseases targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease
              elimination requires collaboration between stakeholders, country
              ownership and the involvement of community-level stakeholders.
              The state of stakeholder relationship determines the ease and
              timeliness of meeting disease elimination targets. Mapping
              stakeholder relationships is critical for assessing gaps in the
              schistosomiasis control program implementation, and providing a
              roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study aimed to
              measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and
              resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo
              state, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a Network
              Representative design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The
              study was conducted within Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local
              Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North (urban) and Akinyele
              (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a link-tracing
              approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from
              stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare,
              academia, and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed
              using Gephi software for network cohesion across the three
              networks. RESULTS: The social network analysis revealed high
              clustering and low density across the three networks implying low
              cohesion across multiple stakeholder categories. The contact and
              collaborative networks were the most active with the lowest level
              of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network. Stakeholders
              were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and
              stakeholders within the organized governance and public health
              system were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control
              program. CONCLUSION: The low cohesion, high clustering and low
              network density among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis
              control program should be addressed in other to drive innovation
              and meet the WHO schistosomiasis elimination target.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Dairy cattle movement could be a major risk factor
              for the spread of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in emerging dairy
              belts of Ethiopia. Dairy cattle may be moved between farms over
              long distances, and hence understanding the route and frequency
              of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread
              of BTB between farms, which could ultimately help to inform
              policy makers to design cost effective control strategies. The
              objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the
              network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on
              the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas
              among the Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa,
              Gondar and Mekelle. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted
              in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern of dairy cattle
              movement for the last 5 years (September 2013 to August 2018).
              Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the
              relationship between the network patterns and the prevalence of
              BTB in these regions were made using social network analysis.
              RESULTS: The cattle movement network structure display both scale
              free and small world properties implying local clustering with
              fewer farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection,
              with the potential to act as super spreaders of BTB if infected.
              Farms having a history of cattle movements onto the herds were
              more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) compared to farms not
              having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and the
              batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with
              prevalence of BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more
              outgoing cattle showed a decrease on the likelihood of BTB
              infection (OR = 0.57) compared to farms which maintained their
              cattle. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the patterns of cattle
              movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to
              the potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk
              of transmission potential could be efficiently targeted by
              control measures aimed at reducing the spread of BTB. The network
              structure described can also provide the starting point to build
              and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other

              Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated
              its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig
              identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement
              control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according
              to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction
              strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network.
              Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected,
              recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis
              were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million
              pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of
              144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and
              51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean
              highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10
              most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per
              week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average
              CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced
              the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction
              it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets
              and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the
              best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available,
              highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance
              in the network. When comparing the static network with its
              temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \%
              overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also
              traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately
              233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be
              more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in
              particular, taking into account the temporal information would
              make the risk assessment much more precise. This information
              could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing
              the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.",

              Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June
              2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig
              trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the
              movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties
              was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was
              developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored,
              and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for
              each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts
              of different disease control strategies on the potential
              magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The
              results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the
              four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More
              batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries)
              were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016
              (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside
              Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi,
              Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties
              (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the
              two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located
              10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes'
              degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network
              property, and the network in January had a higher clustering
              coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length
              (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of
              the network were in the central, northern and western regions of

              of this paper is to corroborate the characteristics government
              ministries and domestic and foreign institutions exhibit through
              their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a
              disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
              METHODS: Using the social network analysis technique, the span of
              the COVID-19 pandemic was segmented into 3 time frames, and the
              relational characteristics of the COVID-19 contagious disease
              response department and related agencies at home and abroad were
              analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the
              second and third time frames indicates that the agents reacting
              to contagious diseases do not necessarily hold the central
              position in the network. From this, it can be inferred that it is
              not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the key
              to a successful response to various disasters also lies in
              cooperation with the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The
              incongruency between the findings of this paper and the existing
              disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that both
              the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate
              for a coordinated crisis response in disaster situations.
              Furthermore, much significance lies in the fact that this paper
              explores the various aspects that could surface among the host
              and relevant parties in a real-life pandemic.",

              use cessation among peers predicts injection drug use cessation
              among individuals and explores whether this association varies by
              relationship type and strength. METHODS: Data were collected
              through baseline and 6-month assessments for the Social Networks
              among Appalachian People study (2008-2011).
              Interviewer-administered surveys collected sociodemographic and
              drug use behaviors (past 6 months and lifetime). Participants
              also listed sex, drug use, and social support partners (past 6
              months). Listed names were cross-referenced with survey
              participants to identify relationships between study
              participants. The analytic sample was further restricted to
              include only those relationship pairs where both individuals
              reported a history of injection drug use at baseline (n = 244
              unique individuals and 746 dyads). We fit a generalized
              estimating equations logistic regression model to (1) assess the
              relationship between peer injection cessation and individual
              injection cessation and (2) determine whether the strength of
              this association differs by relationship-level variables (i.e.,
              relationship role, relationship type, relationship duration,
              frequency of interaction, residential proximity). RESULTS:
              Overall, those with a network member who ceased injection drug
              use were more likely to stop injecting over the following 6-month
              period (AOR=1.65). The magnitude of this association was greater
              for social support partners (AOR=2.95), family members
              (AOR=3.56), those with whom the participant interacted at least
              daily (AOR=2.17), and those who the participant knew longer
              (AOR=2.09). Further, among family members, the effect size was
              greater when relationships were further restricted to immediate
              family members (AOR=5.35). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that
              in this rural community, closer, more supportive relationships,
              may be more influential for modeling injection cessation;
              however, relationship-types were not mutually exclusive so
              differences in effect size across strata may not be statistically
              significant. In this setting, social support through the recovery
              process (including cessation attempts with peers) may increase
              likelihood of injection cessation.",

              effectiveness of complying with mask-wearing guidelines
              recommended by the government. METHODS: A mathematical model with
              a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a
              COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model
              was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang
              Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated
              baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of
              complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations
              estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the
              outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI],
              937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed
              data. The counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing
              estimated an average of 45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a
              standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the
              church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the
              outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA
              is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of
              COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are
              based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary
              implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still
              relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are
              unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to
              develop precise measures and guidelines for particular
              organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster
              outbreaks.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Whilst prevalence of youth smoking in middle and high
              income countries has decreased, inequality has prevailed. The
              introduction of legislation regulating tobacco use in public
              spaces varies across countries, impacting the tobacco control
              context. Thus reviewing our knowledge of how social networks may
              influence smoking differently within different contexts is
              required to facilitate the development of context-specific
              interventions. METHODS: The search, conducted on 31st May 2019,
              included the following smoking-related terms; schools,
              adolescents, peers and social networks. Inclusion and exclusion
              criteria were applied throughout the title and abstract screening
              and full text screening. Quality assessment and synthesis
              followed. Studies were narratively synthesised to identify
              changes according to legislative context. This synthesis was
              conducted separately for findings relating to three categories:
              socioeconomic status; social selection and influence; and network
              position. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. Differences in
              the relationship between network characteristics and smoking
              according to socioeconomic status were measured in five out of
              fifteen studies in Europe. Results varied across studies, with
              differences in network characteristics and their association with
              smoking varying both between schools of a differing and those of
              a similar socioeconomic composition. For studies conducted both
              before and after the introduction of comprehensive smoking
              legislation, the evidence for selection processes was more
              consistent than influence, which varied according to reciprocity.
              Findings showed that isolates were more likely to smoke and
              in-degree and out-degree centrality were related to smoking both
              before and after the introduction of legislation. The
              relationship between popularity and smoking was contingent on
              school level smoking prevalence in studies conducted before the
              introduction of legislation, but not after. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              effects according to socioeconomic status were underreported in
              the included studies and no consistent evidence of change after
              the introduction of a comprehensive smoking ban was observed.
              Further network analyses are required using more recent data to
              obtain a comprehensive understanding of how network processes may
              influence smoking differently according to socioeconomic status,

              network of friendship established in adolescents doing group
              sports, using different parameters indicative of centrality.
              SETTING: It was carried out in an educational environment, in 11
              classrooms belonging to 5 Schools in Ponferrada (Spain).
              PARTICIPANTS: 235 adolescents were included in the study (49.4\%
              female), who were classified as normal weight or overweight.
              PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Activity
              Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used to study the level
              of physical activity. A social network analysis was carried out
              to analyse structural variables of centrality in different
              degrees of contact. RESULTS: 30.2\% of the participants in our
              study were overweight. Relative to female participants in this
              study, males obtained significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A
              (OR: 2.11; 95\% CI: 1.04 to 4.25; p value: 0.036) and were more
              likely to participate in group sport (OR: 4.59; 95\% CI: 2.28 to
              9.22; p value: 0.000). We found no significant relationship
              between physical activity and the weight status in the total
              sample, but among female participants, those with overweight
              status had higher odds of reporting high levels of physical
              exercise (OR: 4.50; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In
              terms of centrality, differentiating by gender, women who
              participated in group sports were more likely to be classified as
              having low values of centrality, while the opposite effect
              occurred for men, more likely to be classified as having high
              values of centrality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, with
              limitations, underline the importance of two fundamental aspects
              to be taken into account in the design of future strategies:
              gender and the centrality within the social network depending on
              the intensity of contact they have with their peers.",

              fragmentation and total spending, and whether this relationship
              is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured
              from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network
              theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on
              the number of shared patients among providers (ie,
              anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care
              specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring
              for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation
              between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured
              using average path length, which describes how efficiently
              information flows among network members; longer path length
              indicates greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of
              care fragmentation and multivariable regression were used to
              analyze the relationship between care fragmentation and LVAD
              payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of
              post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81\%
              male, 73\% white, 11\% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of
              63.1 years (11.1). The mean (SD) level of care fragmentation in
              provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) payment from
              admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872).
              Mean (SD) total payments at the lower, middle, and upper terciles
              of care fragmentation were $250,135 ($111,924), $243,288
              ($109,376), and $247,290 ($108,241), respectively. In mediation
              analysis, the indirect effect of care fragmentation on total
              payments, through infections, was positive and statistically
              significant ($\beta$=16032.5, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Greater care
              fragmentation in the delivery of care surrounding durable LVAD
              implantation is associated with a higher incidence of infections,
              and consequently, higher payments for Medicare beneficiaries.
              Interventions to reduce care fragmentation may reduce the
              incidence of infections and in turn enhance the value of care for
              patients undergoing durable LVAD implantation.",

              over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over
              40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on
              social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This
              study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known
              to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the
              information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.
              METHODS: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted
              anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting
              vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available
              content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social
              network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The
              final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's $\kappa$ ranged
              0.71-1.0 after double-coding. RESULTS: The majority (89\%) of
              individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who
              divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were
              represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics,
              modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as
              ``trust,'' ``alternatives,'' ``safety,'' and ``conspiracy.'' For
              example, a comment representative of ``conspiracy'' is that
              poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical
              symptoms of polio. An example from the ``alternatives'' sub-group
              is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper
              qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that
              these individuals also tended to post material against other
              health-related practices such as water fluoridation and
              circumcision. CONCLUSIONS: Social media outlets may facilitate
              anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the
              diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments
              against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within
              sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health

  abstract = "(i) analyze connectivity between subgroups of university
              students, (ii) assess which bridges of relational contacts are
              essential for connecting or disconnecting subgroups and (iii) to
              explore the similarities between the attributes of the subgroup
              nodes in relation to the pandemic context. During the COVID-19
              pandemic, young university students have experienced significant
              changes in their relationships, especially in the halls of
              residence. Previous research has shown the importance of
              relationship structure in contagion processes. However, there is
              a lack of studies in the university setting, where students live
              closely together. The case study methodology was applied to carry
              out a descriptive study. The participation consisted of 43
              university students living in the same hall of residence. Social
              network analysis has been applied for data analysis. Factions and
              Girvan-Newman algorithms have been applied to detect the existing
              cohesive subgroups. The UCINET tool was used for the calculation
              of the SNA measure. A visualization of the global network will be
              carried out using Gephi software. After applying the
              Girvan-Newman and Factions, in both cases it was found that the
              best division into subgroups was the one that divided the network
              into 4 subgroups. There is high degree of cohesion within the
              subgroups and a low cohesion between them. The relationship
              between subgroup membership and gender was significant. The
              degree of COVID-19 infection is related to the degree of
              clustering between the students. College students form subgroups
              in their residence. Social network analysis facilitates an
              understanding of structural behavior during the pandemic. The
              study provides evidence on the importance of gender, race and the
              building where they live in creating network structures that
              favor, or not, contagion during a pandemic.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Universities are vulnerable to infectious disease
              outbreaks, making them ideal environments to study transmission
              dynamics and evaluate mitigation and surveillance measures. Here,
              we analyze multimodal COVID-19-associated data collected during
              the 2020-2021 academic year at Colorado Mesa University and
              introduce a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and response framework.
              METHODS: We analyzed epidemiological and sociobehavioral data
              (demographics, contact tracing, and WiFi-based co-location data)
              alongside pathogen surveillance data (wastewater and diagnostic
              testing, and viral genomic sequencing of wastewater and clinical
              specimens) to characterize outbreak dynamics and inform policy.
              We applied relative risk, multiple linear regression, and social
              network assortativity to identify attributes or behaviors
              associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2. To characterize
              SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we used viral sequencing, phylogenomic
              tools, and functional assays. FINDINGS: Athletes, particularly
              those on high-contact teams, had the highest risk of testing
              positive. On average, individuals who tested positive had more
              contacts and longer interaction durations than individuals who
              never tested positive. The distribution of contacts per
              individual was overdispersed, although not as overdispersed as
              the distribution of phylogenomic descendants. Corroboration via
              technical replicates was essential for identification of
              wastewater mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we
              formulate a framework that combines tools into an integrated
              disease surveillance program that can be implemented in other
              congregate settings with limited resources. FUNDING: This work

              interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in

              zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint
              propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social
              grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.)
              in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data
              using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the
              same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social
              interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic
              exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to
              structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species,
              and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social
              (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to
              the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host
              species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through
              macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their
              grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques.
              Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in
              these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in
              anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their
              aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more
              vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social
              structure. The global features of these networks that influence
              disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological
              covariates, need further investigation. Animals that consistently
              interact with both humans and their conspecifics are important
              targets for disease control.",

              vaccination dissemination would appreciably lower the death and

              Index (EVI) that quantitatively evaluates the subject's potential
              risk. Our primary aim for the suggested index is to diminish both

              designed with clinical factors determining the mortality and
              social factors incorporating the infection rate. Through
              statistical COVID-19 patient dataset analysis and social network

              PCR-based testing of the close contacts of Health Care Workers
              with confirmed infections are essential steps to limit nosocomial

              describes the management of a cluster of SARS-COV-2 infections in
              three Operative Units. The contact tracing activities and the
              measures implemented to control the outbreak are described.
              RESULTS: Among the 186 Health Care Workers active in the cluster
              setting, there were 9 (4.8\%) confirmed cases, including the
              index case. Due to the outbreak, three Operative Units were

              important role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors.
              Methodological advances permit simultaneous modeling of these
              contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few
              empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do
              typically: examine each context separately; include contexts for
              the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data; or do
              not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an
              eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of
              socio-contextual contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol
              use. The primary parameters of interest are therefore variance
              rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed
              effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how
              each context may matter differently for male and female
              adolescents.Method: Data come from the National Longitudinal
              Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 females, n = 8,102
              males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and
              cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and
              sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups,
              schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%,
              respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use.
              Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups
              and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative
              to neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females.
              These findings have both methodological and practical
              implications. Multilevel modeling can model contexts
              simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth
              alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention
              strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools

              serious public health threat and spread rapidly between
              healthcare facilities (HCFs) during interfacility patient
              movement. We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated
              with network clustering and positions during patient
              interfacility transfer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was
              conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social
              network analysis was performed by constructing
              facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE
              surveillance data. The network method (community detection
              algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the
              network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local
              connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each
              healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression
              analysis was applied to test the association between network
              measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. RESULTS: A
              network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10
              acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of
              identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi
              metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters,
              yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care
              abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold
              (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
              3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each
              additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\%
              CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF.
              CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was
              predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased
              surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are
              warranted.",

              optimization framework",
  author   = "Cheng, Chun-Hung and Kuo, Yong-Hong and Zhou, Ziye",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An effective approach to containing epidemic
              outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19) is targeted immunization, which
              involves identifying ``super spreaders'' who play a key role in
              spreading disease over human contact networks. The ultimate goal
              of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is
              to minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with
              the famous influence maximization problem studied in the field of
              social network analysis, whose objective is to identify a group
              of influential individuals to maximize the influence spread over
              social networks. This study aims to establish the equivalence of
              the two problems and develop an effective methodology for
              targeted immunization through the use of influence maximization.
              METHODS: We present a concise formulation of the targeted
              immunization problem and show its equivalence to the influence
              maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold
              diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well
              as the targeted immunization problem, can be solved by an
              optimization approach. A Benders' decomposition algorithm is
              developed to solve the optimization problem for effective
              solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is
              conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the
              optimization approach on real-world large-scale networks.
              Computational results show that our proposed approaches achieve
              more effective solutions compared to existing methods.
              CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization
              and influence maximization problems and present a concise
              formulation for the influence maximization problem under the
              Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff between
              computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is
              illustrated. Our results suggest that the capability of
              determining the optimal group of individuals for immunization is
              particularly crucial for the containment of infectious disease
              outbreaks within a small network. Finally, our proposed
              methodology not only determines the optimal solutions for target
              immunization, but can also aid policymakers in determining the
              right level of immunization coverage.",

              surveys, and surveillance activities to detect the virus in
              horses, birds, mosquitoes, and humans. Organizations often
              carried them out independently, leading to knowledge gaps within

              unknown, and its local epidemiological cycle is still poorly
              understood. Within the framework of a pilot project started in
              Guadeloupe in 2019, West Nile virus was chosen as a federative

              series of virtual workshops were organized among actors to

              primarily of Black and Latino sexual and gender minorities, with
              HIV prevalence from non-probability samples ranging from 4\% to

              utilized to understand how sexual health communication (SHC)
              influences sexual health behaviors of HBC-MSM. The proposed study
              will advance this goal by describing characteristics of SHC
              embedded within social and sexual networks, and identifying the
              effects of SHC on sexual health behaviors among a sample of Black
              and Latino HBC-MSM. METHODS: This study entails cross-sectional
              quantitative survey design with internet-based data collection to
              test a theory-driven model of the effects of autonomy supportive
              communication on sexual health behaviors. Respondent-driven
              sampling (RDS) and internet driven sampling (ID) will be used to
              recruit a sample of 200 HBC-MSM. We will utilize egocentric
              network analysis to describe (a) the HBC-specific social and/or
              sexual network members who provide SHC; (b) the degree of
              autonomy support provided by network members, and (c) the sexual
              health behaviors characterizing the sample of HBC-MSM. Structural
              equation modeling (SEM) will be performed to test associations
              between autonomy supportive sexual health communication
              (independent variable) and sexual health behaviors (outcome),

              HBC-MSM. The study provides an critical perspective on sexual
              health behaviors and motivations as participants operate in HBC.

              chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading
              practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification
              of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted.
              Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the

              cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to
              Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers
              collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities

              vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the
              exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers
              to mitigation. Cultural brokering and community social capital
              are key supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These

              drinking quantity, and the AUDIT (rs = 0.21 to 0.51, ps < 0.001),
              providing support for convergent validity. There was a
              significantly higher BASDA score for those scoring at or above an
              AUDIT cutoff for hazardous drinking (p < 0.001), providing
              support for criterion-related validity. Finally, beyond motives
              and covariates, the BASDA was significantly associated with total
              AUDIT score ($\Delta$R(2) = 0.09, p < 0.001), indicating its
              additive contribution and providing support for incremental
              validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed excellent fit,
              and all items significantly loaded onto a single factor (p <
              0.0001), providing evidence of internal validity. The resulting
              alcohol social density latent variable was significantly and
              robustly associated with drinks per week and AUDIT total score.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support for the BASDA
              as a valid and efficient measure of social network alcohol
              density for understanding social influences on alcohol misuse.",

              Internet use (PIU) has become a serious issue among residential
              college students, who remain physically isolated from off-campus
              society. This study constructs an integrated model to investigate
              the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and
              objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n
              = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese
              university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to
              measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed
              via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using
              Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis
              and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors'
              effects on PIU. RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence rate of
              PIU was 30.6\%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor
              for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer
              environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree
              performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network
              conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low
              prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a
              risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective
              efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more
              than one PIU friend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further
              intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal
              LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally,
              interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may
              enhance the prevention of PIU.",

              depressive symptoms are influenced by social networks in a
              stressful context, especially focusing on the processes of social
              selection and social influence. The current study aimed to
              explore the coevolution of sociometric popularity and depressive
              symptoms among adolescents suffering from the stress attached to
              the Chinese gaokao. METHODS: The analytical sample comprised 1062
              Chinese adolescents who were under significant pressure to return
              to school for an additional year (returnees) to prepare for
              college entrance examinations. Students were assessed for
              depressive symptoms and asked to nominate up to five friends
              within their classes across four waves (six months). We employed
              stochastic actor-oriented models to investigate the
              interdependent relationships between popularity and depressive
              symptoms. RESULTS: Adolescents' depressive symptoms negatively
              predicted future friendship popularity in this stressful
              situation, but not vice versa. The results of this study also
              highlighted the importance of friends' popularity, indicating
              that adolescents who nominated popular peers as friends tended to
              subsequently have lower depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These
              findings suggested that friends' popularity may serve as a
              protective factor against depressive symptoms under major chronic
              stress. Network-based interventions may have practical

              AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in
              medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
              conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in
              which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the
              care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
              Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and
              uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network
              analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links
              between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical
              staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor
              identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask
              or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25;
              betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and
              mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group.
              This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest
              influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality:
              0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the
              uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected
              group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64).
              For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood
              Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two
              isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the
              main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting
              COVID-19 infection. The main factor contributing to COVID-19

              cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to
              central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation
              level, kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based
              cooperation has the widest scope, while proximity-based
              cooperation exists throughout these two main models of
              cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core
              position in the network, and play an important role in utilizing
              structural holes and bridging. Patent applicants with high
              centrality are mostly firms. Research institutes and universities

              isolation (e.g., perceived loneliness) have been well documented
              in older adults. However, little is known about the impact of
              collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought
              to examine the association of group-level segregation with
              cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults. METHODS: From the
              prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
              database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who
              were aged $\geq$60 years or were married to those aged $\geq$60
              years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups
              separate from the major social group were defined as
              group-level-segregated. The CVH score was calculated as the
              number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from
              the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal
              logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and
              longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and
              CVH. RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years;
              60.0\% female), 108 (20.5\%) were segregated at baseline. In the
              crosssectional analysis, group-level segregation was
              significantly associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH
              score at baseline after adjusting for socio-demographic factors
              and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95\% confidence

              completed an 8-year follow-up, group-level segregation at
              baseline was marginally associated with lower odds of having a
              higher CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.24 to 1.02).
              CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse
              CVH. These findings imply that the social network structure of a

              pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial
              farm density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a
              scale-free topology but was very sparse, suggesting a moderate
              impact of infectious disease outbreaks. However, two regions
              (Upper Austria and Styria) may present a higher structural
              vulnerability. The network also showed very high assortativity

              epidemiological investigations of 1218 COVID-19 cases in eight
              areas of China, we use text analysis, social network analysis and
              visualization methods to construct a dynamic contact network of
              the epidemic. We analyze the corresponding demographic
              characteristics, network indicators, and structural
              characteristics of this network. We found that more than 65\% of
              cases are likely to be infected by a strong relationship, and
              nearly 40\% of cases have family members infected at the same
              time. The overall connectivity of the contact network is low, but
              there are still some clustered infections. In terms of the degree
              distribution, most cases' degrees are concentrated between 0 and
              2, which is relatively low, and only a few ones have a higher

              this study is to assess the 'Zero Childhood Cancer Personalised
              Medicine Program' (the Zero Program), an Australian first-ever
              and most comprehensive personalised medicine programme for
              children with high-risk or relapsed cancer, in terms of its
              structure, process and implementational effect. METHODS AND
              ANALYSIS: We will assess Program delivery mechanisms. The
              development of the implementation and evaluation strategy will
              concentrate on the work of the Zero Program as a complex whole.
              This includes the structure of collaborative links across
              stakeholder groups involved in Program development and delivery,
              changes to collaborative relationships over time and the impact
              of group working on Program outcomes. We are applying a
              mixed-methods design including: a rapid ethnography (observations
              of stakeholder interactions and informal conversations), Program
              professionals' completion of a rapid health implementation
              proforma and a social network analysis. Formative evaluations of
              the implementation science effects, applying feedback techniques,
              for example, Formative Evaluation Feedback Loops and the Zero
              Program professionals' feedback, will determine where Program
              tailoring may be needed. A repeat of the social network analysis
              downstream will examine network changes over time, followed by an
              expert panel using the expert recommendations for implementing
              change to assess the integration of implementation strategies
              into the Program structure. A summative evaluation of the Program
              will bring the research elements together, leading to
              comprehensive data triangulation and determining the
              sustainability and implementational effects of Program delivery.

              analgesics despite a steady decline in the number of individual
              prescriptions directing $\geq$ 90 morphine milligram equivalents
              (MME)/day may be explained by patient exposures to redundant
              prescriptions from multiple prescribers. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated
              prescribers' specialty and social network characteristics
              associated with high-risk opioid exposures resulting from
              single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or
              multi-prescriber discoordination. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
              study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of prescribers with opioid
              analgesic prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users
              in an Illinois Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016. MAIN
              MEASURES: Per prescriber rates of single-prescriber
              high-daily-dose prescriptions or multi-prescriber
              discoordination. KEY RESULTS: For 2280 beneficiaries, 36,798
              opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers.
              Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers
              and 7\% of beneficiaries) that directed $\geq$ 90 MME/day,
              discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk
              exposures-13\% of prescriptions (involving 23\% of prescribers
              and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at
              highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal
              medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence interval)
              5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and
              surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis
              identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of
              high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected
              groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency
              medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the
              sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for
              high-risk exposures. CONCLUSION: Low-volume prescribers in the
              social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or
              discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume
              prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among
              low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should
              be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration
              of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to
              specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are
              potential policy implications.",

              to the east as its complexity continuously increases. Its spatial
              structure takes the form of a radial network pattern with Beijing
              and Shanghai as its centers. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had an
              obvious negative impact on this network at present. (2) On the
              interregional scale, the strength of interregional network ties
              is greater than that of intraregional network ties. The eastern,
              central and western biomedicine innovation networks appear to be

              network analysis, and geographic information system). (1) The
              gravity center of gross domestic product (GDP) of the GBA is
              located in Nansha district, Guangzhou, with a skewing direction
              northwest-east-northwest and a movement rate of
              ``large-small-large.'' The center of import and export and the
              center of consumption show a ``zigzagging migration'' in which
              the center of investment shows an ``irregular (random)
              migration''. (2) The economic connection degree of cities in the

              to be mature, with a significant effect of spatial proximity.
              With the steady increase in network density, there is significant
              polarization of network centrality in the region. The four major

              of live animals) and indirect contacts (via the transit of
              transport vehicles) between farms, which can contribute to the
              spread of pathogens. However, most analyses focus solely on
              direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution
              of live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases.
              Here, we used French live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one
              of the largest transport companies to compare direct and indirect
              contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate how these
              patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of
              highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614
              farms were included in the study, and two directed networks were
              generated: the animal introduction network (exchange of live
              ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles).
              Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were
              scrutinized in relation to farm infection status during the
              epidemic. Results showed that farms were substantially more
              connected in the transit network than in the animal introduction
              network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more
              opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals.
              We also showed that animal introduction and transit networks'
              statistics decreased substantially during the epidemic
              (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods
              (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a
              probability of 33.3 \% that a farm exposed to the infection
              through either of the two live duck movement networks (i.e. that
              was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was reported
              as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within
              seven days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that
              the level of exposure of farms by these two contact patterns was
              low, leading only to a handful of transmission events through
              these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live animal
              movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but
              have been efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the
              French 2020-2021 epidemic. These results underpin the relevance
              of studying indirect contacts resulting from the movement of
              animals to understand their transmission potential and the
              importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease

              similarities between the attributes of the nodes of the groups,
              in relation to diet and gender and, to analyse the connectivity
              between groups based on aspects of similarities between them
              through SNA and artificial intelligence techniques. METHODS: 235
              students from 5 different educational centres participate in this
              study between March and December 2015. Data analysis carried out
              is divided into two blocks: social network analysis and
              unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social
              network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find
              the best number of cohesive groups within each of the friendship
              networks of the different classes analysed. RESULTS: After
              applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the best division
              into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom
              B and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences
              between the groups and the gender and diet variables. After
              applying K-means using population diet as an input variable, a
              K-means clustering of 2 clusters for class A, 3 clusters for
              class B and 3 clusters for class C is obtained. CONCLUSION:
              Adolescents form subgroups within their classrooms. Subgroup
              cohesion is defined by the fact that nodes share similarities in
              aspects that influence obesity, they share attributes related to
              food quality and gender. The concept of homophily, related to
              SNA, justifies our results. Artificial intelligence techniques
              together with the application of the Girvan-Newman provide
              robustness to the structural analysis of similarities and
              cohesion between subgroups.",

              showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the
              possibility of collaboration with other stakeholders. Three
              themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration

              positive for SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 and March 2021, as
              well as the people with whom those individuals had contact. We

              were grocery stores, commercial stores, restaurants, commercial

              highest ``betweenness,'' meaning that they tend to serve as hubs

              more than 1 location in a day or when infected. The highest pairs
              of locations were grocery store/retail store, restaurant/retail

              DESIGN: Retrospective outbreak review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:
              Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria,
              Australia, May-October 2020. METHODS: The Victorian Department of
              Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct
              2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through
              workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through
              households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the
              number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of
              outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission
              via households. RESULTS: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak
              as staff, 91 (4.5\%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three
              outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed
              potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In
              addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak
              through their household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were
              attributed to staff-household transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting
              worker mobility through single-site policies could reduce the
              chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS to another.

              major public health threat and a scientific and technological
              (S\&T) challenge. The lessons learned from the S\&T response of
              Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to
              inform further research and guide scientific investments. The
              present study aimed to assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and
              disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health

              methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and
              potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017.
              ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of
              Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published
              articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library
              Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin
              America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were
              retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation.
              Records from each database were individually downloaded,
              integrated, standardized and analyzed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5421
              ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015
              onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and
              Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the

              backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were
              filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest
              contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations
              of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also

              comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and
              showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and
              disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries

  author   = "Jo, Yun and Hong, Andy and Sung, Hyungun",
  abstract = "COVID-19 has sparked a debate on the vulnerability of densely
              populated cities. Some studies argue that high-density urban
              centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a
              higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other
              studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population
              density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19.
              While several studies have examined the role of urban density and
              connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been
              conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the
              role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing
              different measures of urban density and connectivity during the
              first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of
              density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of
              connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the
              Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database.
              We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of
              confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county
              level, collected individually from regional government websites
              in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an
              important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in
              Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure,
              particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better
              indicator of COVID-19 proliferation than the density measures.
              Our findings imply that policies that take into account different
              types of connectivity between cities might be necessary to
              contain the outbreak in the early phase.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: As sex between men is a major route of human
              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in most western countries,
              restrictive deferral rules for blood donation have largely been
              implemented regarding men having sex with men (MSM). Here, we
              sought here to assign unreported HIV risk factors in blood donors
              (BDs) and reevaluated the MSM-associated fraction of HIV
              transfusion residual risk (\%RR(MSM) ). METHODS: We applied a
              genetic distance-based approach to infer an HIV transmission
              network for 384 HIV sequences from French BDs and 1337 HIV
              sequences from individuals with known risk factors (ANRS PRIMO
              primary HIV infection cohort). We validated the possibility of
              assigning a risk factor according to clustering using assortative
              mixing. Finally, we recalculated the \%RR(MSM) . RESULTS: A total
              of 81 of 284 (28.5\%) male and 5 of 100 (5\%) female BDs belonged
              to a cluster; 72 (88.9\%) of the 81 male BDs belonged to MSM
              clusters. After cluster correction, 8 of 67 (11.9\%), 4 of 21
              (19.0\%), and 19 of 88 (21.6\%) HIV-positive (HIV+) male BDs with
              heterosexual, other, or unknown risk factors could be
              reclassified as MSM, accounting for 10.9\% of the total HIV+ male
              BDs. Overall, 139 of 284 HIV+ male donors (48.9\%) could be
              considered MSM between 2000 and 2016 in France. Between 2005 and
              2016, the \%RR(MSM) increase varied from 0 to 19\%, without
              differing significantly from the \%RR(MSM) before
              reclassification. CONCLUSION: Network inference can be used to
              complement declaration data on risk factors for HIV infection in
              BDs. This approach, complementary to behavioral studies, is a
              valuable tool to evaluate the effect of changes in deferral

              network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV
              vulnerability from sex. The results of our LPA indicated that our

              high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability

              anal sex, group sex, and using drugs to enhance sex were
              positively and significantly associated with higher HIV
              vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV
              vulnerability norm profiles. To mitigate Black SGM's HIV
              vulnerability, future HIV risk reduction strategies can consider

              We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network
              structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical
              network features that identify districts or sub-regions for
              targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed
              weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle
              movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of
              the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset

              that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease

              structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and
              edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These

              would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact

              mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle
              corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Drug use and trading are typically social
              activities; however, supply through cryptomarkets can occur
              without any in-person social contact. People who use drugs alone
              may be at higher risk of experiencing harms, for example, due to
              lack of others who may call for emergency assistance.
              Alternatively, cryptomarkets may be a source of harm reduction
              information and drugs with better-known content and dose,
              potentially reducing the risk of adverse events. This study
              examines relationships between cryptomarket use, drug-using
              social networks and adverse drug events for MDMA, cocaine and
              LSD. METHOD: A subsample of 23,053 respondents from over 70
              countries was collected in the 2018 Global Drug Survey. People
              who reported using MDMA, cocaine or LSD were asked about using
              cryptomarkets to purchase these drugs; any adverse drug events
              requiring medical treatment (combining seeking treatment and
              should have sought treatment but did not); and social networks
              who they had used the specific drug with. All measures referred
              to the last 12 months, hereon referred to as 'recent'. Binary
              logistic regressions examined relationships between cryptomarket
              use, drug-using social networks, and adverse drug events,
              controlling for age, gender, and frequency of drug use. RESULTS:
              Adverse events from any drug type were low (5.2\%) and for each
              drug; MDMA (3.5\%); cocaine (3.3\%); and LSD (3.5\%). After
              controlling for covariates, recent cryptomarket use was
              associated with increased likelihood of having no drug-using
              network for each drug type. People who recently used
              cryptomarkets were more likely to report adverse cocaine (AOR =
              1.70 (1.22-2.37)) and LSD (AOR = 1.58 (1.12-2.09)) events. For
              those reporting a network size >1, network characteristics did
              not differ with recent cryptomarket use; however, those reporting
              recent cryptomarket use were more likely to report adverse LSD
              events (AOR = 1.86 (0.99-3.51)). CONCLUSION: People who reported
              purchasing drugs from cryptomarkets more commonly reported having
              no drug-using network, and cryptomarket purchase was associated
              with reported adverse events. Our results support the notion that
              cryptomarket use increases drug-related harm, but further
              disentanglement of multiple complex mechanisms is needed in
              future research.",

              making it impossible to assess the effect of truck sharing and
              truck contamination on disease transmission. The aim of this
              study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig transport
              network by means of social network analysis and to assess the
              implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In
              particular, we studied how additional information about transport
              sequences changes the topology of the contact network. The study
              is based on the official animal movement database in Switzerland
              and a sample of transport data from one transport company. The
              results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly
              fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease
              outbreak. By considering the time sequence of transports, we
              found that even in the worst case, only 0.34\% of all farm-pairs
              were connected within one month. However, both network
              connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if
              truck sharing and especially truck contamination were considered.
              Therefore, the extent to which a disease may be transmitted
              between animal holdings may be underestimated if we only consider
              data from the official animal movement database. Our results
              highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts
              between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck
              sharing and contamination. As the nature of animal transport
              networks is inherently temporal, we strongly suggest the use of
              temporal network measures in order to evaluate individual and

              lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order

              explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially

              initial stages of resuming research at a large research

              providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue

  abstract = "In 2022, a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created
              considerable challenges for the Shanghai public health system.
              However, conventional prevention and control strategies, which
              only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently decrease the
              number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode
              is needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a
              stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to analyze how these
              social organizations cooperate with others and further identify
              the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and
              sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective
              of social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the
              effects of the actor's attributes, the network structure, and
              dynamic cooperative behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data
              collected from 220 participants in 19 social organizations. The
              results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships
              increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the
              network between social organizations became more reliable.
              Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models were
              significant (t-ratio 2). Additionally, the estimated values
              showed that four factors played a positive role in forming the
              cooperative relationship network, i.e., all except the ``same age
              group effect (−1.02)''. The results also indicated that the

              contribute to this debate by analyzing the structural
              characteristics of a multisectoral network that emerged and
              evolved under strong state control during the 2015 outbreak of
              Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS) in South
              Korea. This study particularly focuses on the evolution of intra-
              and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The data
              for the study were collected through a content analysis of
              government documents and news articles. Using social network
              analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a
              centralized structure around a small number of governmental
              organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between
              participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network
              displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and
              non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health
              organizations, but under different influences of structural
              characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak
              period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the

              destructive consequences on the global poultry production system.
              Recently, a growing number of layer farms have been heavily
              damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased virulence of
              the virus and the intensification of the production system.
              Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive
              practices at the farm level that are aligned with contingency
              measures at the national level to minimize poultry losses.
              However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm workers to
              follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and
              control. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices
              varies with the geographical condition and inter-farm contact
              structures. Hence, the objective of our study was to examine the
              preventive effect of five biosecurity actions commonly practiced
              at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: (i)
              fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a
              farm; iii) disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection
              protocols, iv) an anterior room in the sheds before entering the
              bird area and v) boots changes when moving between sheds in the
              same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer case
              farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI
              epidemic. The odds ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices
              implemented in those study groups were estimated as a preventive
              effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, including seven
              geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian
              hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location
              weighted logistic regression. The results showed that the use of
              a disinfection booth for personnel reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6
              infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 \% credible
              interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial
              variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263). Changing
              boots between sheds on the same farm reduced the odds of HPAIv
              H5N6 infection (AOR = 0.160, 95 \% CrI = 0.024-0.852) with
              relatively wide spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR =
              0.270-0.688). Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols
              at the farm of entry for layer farms is recommended to
              effectively prevent and respond to HPAIv H5N6 infection under
              different local condition. Our study provides an important
              message for layer farmers to effectively implement on-farm
              biosecurity actions against HPAIv H5N6 infection at their farms
              by setting priorities based on their spatial condition and

              diseases-is associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of
              mobility and quality of life as well as financial burden.
              Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide
              valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of
              chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard
              as they contain semantic information on patients' health
              conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on
              understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than
              multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression
              of two chronic diseases in the Australian health context. It
              specifically focuses on the comorbidity progression of
              cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes
              mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in
              Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to
              understand and represent the progression of CVD in patients with
              T2DM using graph theory and social network analysis techniques.
              Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and CVD and
              patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative
              dataset obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two
              baseline disease networks were constructed from these two
              selected cohorts. A final disease network from two baseline
              disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a
              normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and
              electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly
              higher in patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only
              T2DM. This showed that these chronic diseases occurred frequently
              during the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM. The proposed
              network-based model may potentially help the healthcare provider
              to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns
              between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could
              be useful for stakeholders including governments and private
              health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management
              programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The massive scale of social media platforms requires
              an automatic solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic
              solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of
              content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech
              detection problem as a supervised text classification task using
              classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep
              learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in
              Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work
              on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify hate
              speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users
              in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in
              tweets containing hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19
              dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to
              COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed
              for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network
              (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1
              being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix
              factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in
              hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data
              in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets
              greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage
              of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\%
              (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of
              hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) contained a low level of hate
              based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified
              Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19
              hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we
              showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the
              time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate
              tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the
              Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related
              hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination
              of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient
              (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly
              discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of
              the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics
              were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users
              also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab
              region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19
              pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations
              worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social
              media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on
              the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech
              may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which
              increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate
              speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze
              hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in

              Recruitment used a social network respondent-driven sampling
              design in which each seed was asked to recruit three friends, and
              those friends were asked to recruit three friends, for a total of
              twenty groups of 13 friends. We collected data at baseline, and 6
              months and 12 months post intervention completion. We used
              generalized estimating equation models, properly adjusted for
              non-independent contributions of both social network
              interventions, to estimate the effects. Gaussian family
              multivariate models were calculated, addressing exchangeable
              working correlations, including both individual-level and
              cluster-level covariates in these models. RESULTS: A total of 261
              Latina seasonal workers participated in either the HEALTHY or the
              VOICES intervention. There were significant changes over time in
              cognitive factors (HIV knowledge, condom use self-efficacy, and

              both online and offline, we can motivate communities to follow
              preventive measures and shape attitudes toward them. However, the
              abundance of misinformation stories can lead to vaccine
              hesitancy, obstructing the timely implementation of preventive
              measures, such as vaccination. Therefore, it is crucial to create
              appropriate and community-centered solutions based on regional
              data analysis to address mis/disinformation narratives and
              implement effective countermeasures specific to the particular
              geographic area.In this case study, we have attempted to create a
              research pipeline to analyze local narratives on social media,
              particularly Twitter, to identify misinformation spread locally,
              using the state of Pennsylvania as an example. Our proposed
              methodology pipeline identifies main communication trends and
              misinformation stories for the major cities and counties in
              southwestern PA, aiming to assist local health officials and
              public health specialists in instantly addressing pandemic
              communication issues, including misinformation narratives.
              Additionally, we investigated anti-vax actors' strategies in
              promoting harmful narratives. Our pipeline includes data
              collection, Twitter influencer analysis, Louvain clustering, BEND

              Inuit in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to
              better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote
              region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: Isolates
              from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit,
              Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing
              (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within
              clusters was calculated using a threshold of a $\leq$3 single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and
              then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a
              reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of
              epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis.
              RESULTS: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
              isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were
              identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster
              represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire
              study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission
              were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless
              shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a
              nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further
              transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also
              confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of
              transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility
              ($\kappa$ score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0).
              CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors,
              namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a
              gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may
              have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in
              this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.",

              the adoption of behaviours. Little is known, however, about
              whether policies affect how behaviours are shared in a network.
              To contribute to this literature, we apply the concept of
              diffusion centrality to school tobacco policies and adolescent
              smoking. Diffusion centrality is a measure of centrality which
              refers to a person's ability to diffuse a given property-in our
              case, smoking-related behaviours. We hypothesized that stronger
              school tobacco policies are associated with less diffusion
              centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in
              general. A whole network study was carried out in 2013 and 2016
              among adolescents (n = 18,805) in 38 schools located in six
              European cities. Overall, diffusion centrality of smoking in
              general and of smoking on school premises significantly decreased
              over time. Diffusion centrality of smoking significantly
              decreased both in schools where the policy strengthened or
              softened over time, but for diffusion of smoking on school
              premises, this decrease was only significant in schools where it
              strengthened. Finally, stronger school tobacco policies were
              associated with lower diffusion centrality of smoking on school
              premises and of smoking in general, though to a lesser extent.
              With such policies, smoking may, therefore, become less
              prevalent, less popular, and less clustered, thereby lowering the
              risk of it spreading within networks in, and even outside the

              interpersonal relationships vital for American Indian (AI) youth.
              Social relations and multigenerational networks (i.e., peer,
              family, kinship, and community) remain a salient fixture of AI
              culture, survival and thriving in reservation communities.
              Research in other populations has demonstrated how social
              networks impact youth risk and resilience, but data are lacking
              on AI adolescent networks. Intergenerational trauma from settler
              colonialism leads some AI youth to early initiation of substance
              use and subsequent substance misuse, along with
              disproportionately high risk for suicide and vulnerability to
              witnessing and experiencing violence. Using network data to
              develop prevention strategies among this population is a
              promising new avenue of research. In this study protocol paper,
              we describe the rationale and methodology of an exploratory study
              to be conducted with American Indian 9th and 10th graders at
              three schools on a Northern Plains reservation. METHODS: This
              mixed methods study will collect quantitative social network
              surveys (N = 300) and qualitative interviews (n = 30). The study
              will examine the extent to which existing social network theories
              and data metrics adequately characterize AI youth networks or how
              they may need to be expanded for this population. Associations of
              network characteristics with risk and protective factors for
              substance use, exposure to violence, and suicide will also be
              examined. DISCUSSION: This innovative methodological approach
              holds promise for informing the development of effective
              preventive approaches to address co-occurring risks for substance
              use, violence and suicide among AI adolescents. Understanding

              An environmental study and a social network analysis were
              conducted to better understand the transmission process. A total
              56 cases (AR = 0.97\%) were identified. Of 21 serum measles IgM

              misinformation. Misleading narratives around the virus, its
              origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public
              health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between
              the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients
              developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this
              prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility
              COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application
              programming interface was used to collect data containing
              COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a
              period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood
              clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data
              using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We
              subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential
              users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility
              information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research
              presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare
              blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased
              volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content
              propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the
              volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of

              research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of
              low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the
              crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of
              low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the

              prescribing patterns of an individuals' peers, defined as the
              proportion of a prescribers' professional network (based on
              shared clients), which had previously prescribed PSS, updated
              monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a clinician had
              prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given calendar
              month. The secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS
              prescribing, defined as an absence for PSS prescriptions for at
              least 3 months. We estimated logistic regression models using
              generalized estimated equations on monthly repeated measurements
              to determine and characterize the extent to which peer networks
              influenced the initiation and discontinuation of PSS prescribing,
              controlling for network, clinician, and caseload characteristics.
              Innovators were defined as individuals initiating PSS prior to
              May 2020, and early adopters were individuals initiating PSS
              after. RESULTS: Among 14,137 prescribers treating clients with
              substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators of prescribed
              safer supply and 1062 early adopters through the end of study
              follow-up, but 653 (50.6\%) were no longer prescribing by August
              2021. Prescribers with over 20\% of peers whom had adopted PSS
              had a nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing
              themselves (aOR: 3.79, 95\% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those
              with no connected safer supply prescribers. CONCLUSIONS: The
              uptake of PSS in BC was highly dependent on the behavior of
              prescribers' peer networks. Future implementation strategies to
              support PSS or other policies would benefit from leveraging
              networks of prescribers.",

              older men with lung cancer in China. METHODS: We analyzed the
              electronic medical records (EMRs) of lung cancer patients over
              age 65 in the Jilin Province of China. The data studied were
              obtained from 20 hospitals of Jilin Province in 2018. In total,
              1510 patients were identified. We conducted a rank-frequency
              analysis and social network analysis to identify the predominant
              comorbidities and comorbidity networks. We applied the
              association rules to mine the comorbidity combination with the
              values of confidence and lift. A heatmap was utilized to
              visualize the rules. RESULTS: Our analyses discovered that (1)
              there were 31 additional medical conditions in older patients
              with lung cancer. The most frequent comorbidities were pneumonia,
              cerebral infarction, and hypertension. (2) The network-based
              analysis revealed seven subnetworks. (3) The association rules
              analysis provided 41 interesting rules. The results revealed that
              hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and pneumonia are the most
              frequent comorbid combinations. Heart failure may not have a
              strong implicating role in these comorbidity patterns. Cerebral
              infarction was rarely combined with other diseases. In addition,
              glycoprotein metabolism disorder comorbid with hyponatremia or
              hypokalemia increased the risk of anemia by more than eight times
              in older lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
              evidence on the comorbidity patterns of older men with lung
              cancer in China. Understanding the comorbidity patterns of older
              patients with lung cancer can assist clinicians in their
              diagnoses and contribute to developing healthcare policies, as
              well as allocating resources.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: to analyse the trade flow of pigs to Lombardy
              (Northern Italy) to single out the farms more involved in animal
              movements to identify the holdings and areas most exposed to the
              risk of introducing pathogens into the region and to plan proper
              mitigation measures. Indeed, the movement of live animals and of
              the means of transport is one of the main risk factors in the
              spread of diseases and this is particularly relevant in areas
              with high stocking density. DESIGN: statistical analysis on
              movements of pigs entering Lombardy was carried out. Data on
              pigs' movements and farm characteristics were collected from the
              National and Regional databases. Social Network Analysis (SNA)
              was used to analyse the flows of pigs to Lombardy, to identify
              the holdings and geographical areas that are central in the
              trading network and that could have a role in the introduction of
              swine pathogens into the region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data
              on pigs' movements introduced into Lombardy in 2016 were
              analysed. Lombardy is a region of Northern Italy with intensive
              livestock husbandry. The pig sector is of particular economic
              relevance also in view of the processing industry, suited to the
              production of high quality pork products. Annually about 1.8
              million pigs are introduced into the region also to satisfy the
              request of the processing industry for the production of pork
              products. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: in this study, the farms that
              buy pigs from outside the region were identified as well as the
              territories where the largest number of pigs are introduced. The
              analysis was carried out also considering certain factors related
              to the movement of animals, which can be relevant for the
              transmission of pathogens, such as number of commercial partners,
              number of exchanged animals, and number of shipments. RESULTS: in
              2016, 1,782,568 pigs were introduced into Lombardy; by using SNA,
              it was possible to highlight a complex trade network of pigs,
              mainly involving the Northern regions. Indeed, the pigs were
              mostly purchased from Emilia Romagna (33.4\%), followed by Veneto
              and Piedmont. These regions have been the most closely analysed
              in this study. SNA was also used to identify Lombardy territories
              (provinces and municipalities) which, based on the number of
              introduced pigs, are potentially most exposed to the introduction
              of pathogens from outside the region. Mantua and Brescia
              provinces resulted the most exposed area. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is
              one of most important European producers of pigs and about 50\%
              of national pig assets is present in Lombardy; furthermore, about
              1.8 million pigs are introduced yearly into the region.
              Currently, the region is free from the main diseases of pigs and
              the introduction of an epidemic disease into the pig population
              could adversely affect the entire productive sector. For this
              reason, an analysis of the movements of pigs entering the region
              was carried out to identify the areas (provinces, municipalities)
              and holdings most exposed to the risk of introduction of
              pathogens. This information is relevant for the veterinary
              authorities to plan appropriate control activities (official
              controls, surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination, where
              possible) in order to enhance disease prevention and promote
              early detection.",

              sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities
              are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs,
              (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii)
              similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB)
              had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics
              (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian
              and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to
              cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in
              transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's
              disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory

              diseases of the pleura, and anemia. To sum up, races/ethnicities
