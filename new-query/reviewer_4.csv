This study investigates the spread of misinformation on social network data using social network analysis (SNA) metrics, and more generally by using well known network science metrics. Moreover, we propose a process design that utilizes social network data from Twitter, to analyze the involvement of non-trusted accounts in spreading misinformation supported by a proof-of-concept prototype. The proposed prototype includes modules for data collection, data preprocessing, network creation, centrality calculation, community detection, and misinformation spreading analysis. We conducted an experimental study on a COVID-19-related Twitter dataset using the modules. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and process steps, and provides valuable insight into the application of network science metrics on social network data for analysing various influence-parameters in misinformation spreading.","10.3390/computers12110232","232","2073-431X",NA,"WOS:001108187900001","AktaÅŸ, Mehmet S./G-9710-2012 Riveni, Mirela/X-6345-2019 ","AktaÅŸ, Mehmet S./0000-0001-7908-5067 Riveni, Mirela/0000-0002-4991-3455 Duzen, Zafer/0000-0002-8743-8309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

Empirical evidence about which communication strategies are effective around breastfeeding messaging is scarce. To fill this gap, we aimed to identify influencers in the largest available Twitter database using social network analysis (n = 10,694 users), inductively analyze tweets, and explore communication strategies, motivations, and challenges via semi-structured interviews. Influencers had diverse backgrounds within and beyond the scientific health community (SHC; 42.7\%): 54.7\% were from the general public and 3\% were companies. SHC contributed to most of the tweets (n = 798 tweets), disseminating guidelines and research findings more frequently than others (p < 0.001). Influencers from the general community mostly tweeted opinions regarding the current state of breastfeeding research and advocacy. Interviewees provided practical strategies (e.g., preferred visuals, tone, and writing style) to achieve personal and societal goals including career opportunities, community support, and improved breastfeeding practices. Complex challenges that need to be addressed were identified. Ideological differences regarding infant feeding may be hampering constructive communication, including differences in influencers' interpretation of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and in perspectives regarding which social media interactions encompass conflict of interest.","10.3390/ijerph18126181","6181",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000666522800001",NA,"Rehm, Martin/0000-0002-9553-7008 Caduff, Anita/0000-0002-2736-2170 Perez-Escamilla, Rafael/0000-0001-9416-8039",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6

We examine these large-scale datasets using a range of methods, including social network analysis, gender prediction using historical census data, and generative statistical models for topic analysis (Latent Dirichletallocation). We find that present-day discourses centre around moral outrage and structural oppression by institutional government and the media, suggesting a strong logic of `conspiracy-style' beliefs and thinking. Furthermore, anti-vaccination pages on Facebook reflect a highly `feminised' movement the vast majority of participants are women. Although anti-vaccination networks on Facebook are large and global in scope, the comment activity sub-networks appear to be `small world'.

A preliminary semiotic evaluation revealed a semantically rich and comprehensive knowledge base to represent complex social network relationships. With Semantic Web Rules Language, we demonstrated FOAF+ potential to infer social network ties between individual data.

Such method has been applied to many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO) returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to study drug policy.","10.1371/journal.pone.0282340","e0282340","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000996122900034","Ritter, Alison/K-1195-2012 ","/0000-0003-3582-3261",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11

Melanoma is a critical public health issue with a substantial economic burden. Cases and associated burdens, however, could be prevented with a greater awareness of, and interventions related to, skin cancer and melanoma-related preventive behaviors. In fact, as social media use is close to ubiquitous, it represents a potential communication modality. However, more research is needed to understand the current state of melanoma-related information exchanged between Twitter users. This study aimed to understand the different types of users controlling the melanoma-related information diffusion and conversation themes on Twitter. Methods: Tweets (n = 692) were imported from Twitter between 1 and 31 May 2021 using the Twitter public API; and uploaded to NodeXL to conduct a social network analysis. Results: Health professionals and organizations with medical backgrounds were the main content producers, disseminators, and top influencers. However, information diffusion is slow and uneven among users. Additionally, conversations lacked a focus on preventive behaviors. Conclusion: Twitter is a potential platform for the targeted outreach of individuals in melanoma awareness campaigns. This study provides insights maximizing the effectiveness of Twitter as a communication modality. Our findings can help guide the development of customized content and interventions during melanoma awareness campaigns.","10.3390/ijerph191811284","11284",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000859450700001","Walsh-Buhi, Eric/C-5106-2011","Walsh-Buhi, Eric/0000-0002-1690-5352",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13

Background: Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has more recently been used to study health-related topics including obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence, quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and reproducibility. Methods: We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks, take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters. Results: We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also present an example of SNA. Conclusions: SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors-and subsequently health.","10.1177/19375867211013772","19375867211013772","1937-5867","2167-5112","WOS:000649496900001","Culyba, Alison/GNP-5083-2022 ","Rankine, Jacquelin/0000-0002-8072-6762 Culyba, Alison/0000-0002-1080-2176 Burgette, Jacqueline/0000-0001-5677-6295","MAY 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25

However, social bots can interfere with the social media topics that humans follow. We analyzed and visualized Twitter data during the prevalence of the Wuhan lab leak theory and discovered that 29\% of the accounts participating in the discussion were social bots. We found evidence that social bots play an essential mediating role in communication networks. Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified messages across social media. These findings show that limiting the use of social bots might be an effective method to minimize the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.","10.3390/ijerph192416376","16376",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000901057600001",NA,"Weng, Zixuan/0000-0001-6329-0912",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26

Little attention has been paid to the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals. Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt MDRO transmission across a health care network.","10.1177/0033354920930213","0033354920930213","0033-3549","1468-2877","WOS:000540706300001","Rankin, Danielle A/AAT-8589-2021 ","Rankin, Danielle A/0000-0003-3018-3373 Matthews, Sarah/0000-0001-8372-1185","JUN 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28

The complete procedure for carrying out a social network analysis (SNA) is a time-consuming task that entails a series of steps in which the expert in social network analysis could make mistakes. This research presents a multi-domain knowledge model capable of automatically gathering data and carrying out different social network analyses in different domains, without errors and obtaining the same conclusions that an expert in SNA would obtain. The model is represented in an ontology called OntoSNAQA, which is made up of classes, properties and rules representing the domains of People, Questionnaires and Social Network Analysis. Besides the ontology itself, different rules are represented by SWRL and SPARQL queries. A Knowledge Based System was created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a real case study in order to show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the results of an SNA analysis obtained through the model were compared to those obtained from some of the most widely used SNA applications: UCINET, Pajek, Cytoscape and Gephi, to test and confirm the validity of the model.

Many community-based programmes design interventions to address tangible challenges within the social determinants of health, such as asset insecurity or food insecurity, to address health inequities. The growing need to address social isolation within marginalised communities also requires organisations to collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen their own social integration within the community. The present research reports on the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of community programmes within three southern U.S. cities and their local collaborations to address social isolation. After interviewing representatives of 46 community organisations, it was found that social service organisations that also offer public health services play a central role in community efforts to improve social isolation. The participating organisations primarily collaborate through referrals and information sharing, and report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition that social services and supports play a considerable role in addressing health inequities, this study provides evidence of opportunities for interorganisational collaboration to promote individual and community health.","10.1111/hsc.14044",NA,"0966-0410","1365-2524","WOS:000862272800001",NA,"Creel, Liza/0000-0003-1222-678X","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41

The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is still a challenge.","10.3390/su12114655","4655",NA,"2071-1050","WOS:000543391800318","Fernandez de Arroyabe, Juan Carlos/T-5755-2017 ","Fernandez de Arroyabe, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-1451-3782 Calvo Gallardo, Elena/0000-0002-2002-6190",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,42

Algorithmic recommendation-based technology along with users' selective exposure and group pressure lead to online echo chambers, causing inefficiency in vaccination promotion. Avoiding or breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior. Objective: With the ultimate goal of eliminating the impact of echo chambers related to vaccine hesitancy on social media during public health emergencies, the aim of this study was to develop a framework to quantify the echo chamber effect in users' topic selection and attitude contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations; detect online opinion leaders and structural hole spanners based on network attributes; and explore the relationships of their behavior patterns and network locations, as well as the relationships of network locations and impact on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Methods: We called the Sina Weibo application programming interface to crawl tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user information on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Adopting social network analysis, we examined the low echo chamber effect based on topics in representational networks of information, according to attitude in communication flow networks of users under different interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual analyses were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and to explore their function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Results: Users showed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, whereas the opposite trend was found for the latter. Speakers, replicators, and monologists tended to be opinion leaders, whereas common users, retweeters, and networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and spanners tended to be ``bridgers{''} to disseminate diverse topics and communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, users who tended to echo a single topic could bridge multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also tended to serve as bridgers for different attitudes. Conclusions: This study not only revealed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine hesitancy, but further elucidated the underlying reasons from the perspective of users, offering insights for research about the form, degree, and formation of echo chambers, along with depolarization, social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination pattern of topic, and sentiment. Therefore, this work can help to provide strategies for public health and public opinion managers to cooperate toward avoiding or correcting echo chamber chaos and effectively promoting online vaccine campaigns.","10.2196/40701","e40701","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000964999100004",NA,"Wang, Dandan/0000-0002-5319-5820",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0\% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.","10.2196/19458","e19458","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000530598600001","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Lopez Segui, Francesc/A-6483-2019 ","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Lopez Segui, Francesc/0000-0003-0977-0215 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46

Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. Using social network analysis, we identified potential superspreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd in Mississippi. Analysis of age structure revealed that the majority of potential super-spreaders were young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also compared infection risk across the landscape by combining social network analysis and heatmapping software to locate disease transmission hotspots, where the risk of disease transmission is higher as compared to other locations. We also monitored predator and hunting activity and hunter deer harvests to better understand how predators influence social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity influenced the age structure of male WTD communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or the removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model for predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, describes new methods to locate transmission hotspots, and provides new knowledge for disease management and prevention strategies. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, WTD) spread communicable diseases such the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious prion disease occurring in cervids. Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. In this study, we used network analysis from scrape visitation data to identify potential super-spreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd. We combined local network communities to form a large region-wide social network consisting of 96 male WTD. Analysis of WTD bachelor groups and random network modeling demonstrated that scraping networks depict real social networks, allowing detection of direct and indirect contacts, which could spread diseases. Using this regional network, we model three major types of potential super-spreaders of communicable disease: in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness potential super-spreaders. We found out-degree and betweenness potential super-spreaders to be critical for disease transmission across multiple communities. Analysis of age structure revealed that potential super-spreaders were mostly young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also used social network analysis to measure the outbreak potential across the landscape using a new technique to locate disease transmission hotspots. To model indirect transmission risk, we developed the first scrape-to-scrape network model demonstrating connectivity of scrape sites. Comparing scrape betweenness scores allowed us to locate high-risk transmission crossroads between communities. We also monitored predator activity, hunting activity, and hunter harvests to better understand how predation influences social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity significantly influenced the age structure of scraping communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model capable of predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, outlines methods to locate transmission hotspots and community crossroads, and provides new insight for disease management and outbreak prevention strategies.","10.3390/ani13071171","1171","2076-2615",NA,"WOS:000969429200001",NA,"Huang, Miranda/0000-0001-8891-9772",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51

Online-social-network-based parental-health-education is a potential way to reduce child unintentional injuries. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms by which online-social-network-based health education may reduce the unintentional injuries among children aged 0-3 years. MethodsWe conducted a participant-blinded, randomized controlled, online-social-network-based health-education intervention study from March 2019 to February 2020 in Shanghai. We established four WeChat groups (two intervention groups and two control groups). For the intervention groups, a doctor's assistant regularly delivered information regarding unintentional injuries among children, and community childcare doctors answered parents' questions concerning their children's health, including unintentional injuries. Meanwhile, the control groups did not receive any information from the assistant. The study selected one intervention group and one control group and compared the ego network and whole network indicators to determine the differences between the intervention and control groups. ResultsIn the intervention and control groups, 64.5\% and 31.9\% of the members, respectively, engaged in communication, and 1,736 and 273 records, respectively, were obtained. Regarding ego network, the doctor showed the largest network in the intervention group, and the size of the intervention group's network was twice that of the control group; the number of ties in the intervention group was nine times that of the control group. Fourteen and four parents in the intervention and control group played an active role, respectively. Regarding centrality, all WeChat groups were loose and multiple centers existed. Regarding subgroup cohesion, the intervention group had 28 cliques with 27 members, and the control group had 4 cliques with 4 members. For structural hole, 23.7\% and 7.5\% members in the intervention and control group actively participated in interactions, respectively, having strong control and influence over other parents; 69.2\% and 59.1\% members in the intervention and control group, respectively, had values of < 1.000, showing that they had strong ability to cross-jump structural holes. DiscussionOnline-social-networks-based health education interventions could enhance communication among parents, and between parents and community childcare doctors, and also shorten the social distance between them. Thus, online-social-network-based parental-health-education-intervention can be a feasible and generalizable means of preventing unintentional injuries among children.","10.3389/fpubh.2022.1049851","1049851",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000917837200001","Feng, Yuheng/JQX-2576-2023 lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,54

To contribute to that debate, we examined how health journalists from the mainstream news organizations in the U.S. used Twitter's @mention for sourcing during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a sample of public Twitter posts published by the journalists, we formed co-@mentioned networks (i.e., two sources were connected if @mentioned in the same post) to examine the structure of the networks and identify important sourcing informants. Among the results, elite sources (e.g., health journalists and health experts in the public sector) and influential users (i.e., verified users with a large number of followers and who post frequently) dominated the sourcing repertoire. Moreover, the networks were fragmented because the sources were clustered into several close-knit subgroups. Analyzing exponential random graph models to examine the formation mechanism of the networks revealed that, as the pandemic's severity increased, influential users played a more salient role in the sourcing repertoire, and a homogeneous cluster consisting of journalists and news organizations emerged.","10.1080/17512786.2022.2110927",NA,"1751-2786","1751-2794","WOS:000843093300001","Zhang, Xinzhi/S-9610-2019 ","Zhang, Xinzhi/0000-0003-3479-9327 Zhu, Rui/0000-0002-0123-1156","AUG 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57

Although aggregate metrics on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little about how information spreads on online social networks. Health information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola messages.MethodsOur data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user, disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting patterns.ResultsOn average, 91\% of the retweets were directly retweeted from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5\% of the retweeting paths of the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers via influential and hidden influential users.ConclusionsBroadcasting was the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the message across, because influential and hidden influential users can reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users.","10.1186/s12889-019-6747-8","438","1471-2458",NA,"WOS:000465914900004","Liang, Hai/AAB-2150-2020 Liang, Hai/F-3797-2015 Meltzer, Martin/AAT-3235-2021 Fu, King-wa/A-2385-2010 Fu, King-wa/GLT-7841-2022 ","Liang, Hai/0000-0003-1779-9552 Liang, Hai/0000-0003-1779-9552 Meltzer, Martin/0000-0002-7250-0472 Fu, King-wa/0000-0001-8157-5276 Fu, King-wa/0000-0001-8157-5276 Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai/0000-0001-5496-2529 Tse, Zion/0000-0001-9741-1137",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,59

First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings Results - found very little misinformation and disinformation distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum engagement.

We used Health Links, a province-wide program in Canada aiming to improve care coordination among multiple providers of high-needs patients, as an example of a health system intervention. At the planning phase, an SNA can depict the structure, network influencers, and composition of clusters at various levels. It can inform the engagement and execution by identifying potential targets (e.g., opinion leaders) and by revealing structural gaps and clusters. It can also be used to assess the outcomes of the intervention, such as its success in increasing network connectivity; changing the position of certain actors; and bridging across specialties, organizations, and sectors. We provided an overview of how an SNA lens can shed light on the complexity of implementation along the entire implementation pathway, by revealing the relational barriers and facilitators, the application of network-informed and network-altering interventions, and testing hypotheses on network consequences of the implementation.","10.1177/0163278718772887",NA,"0163-2787","1552-3918","WOS:000485316400001","Nooraie, Reza Yousefi/AAU-5379-2021 ","Nooraie, Reza Yousefi/0000-0002-9002-7121 Gutberg, Jennifer/0000-0002-2045-4929",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,62

Data Sources We used 2018 National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems data, a nationally representative cohort of the US public health systems. Study Design Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of tribal organization participation in public health networks and to understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574 respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of 258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services participating in the network and the scope of public health activities implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of tribal organizations remains low.","10.1111/1475-6773.14012",NA,"0017-9124","1475-6773","WOS:000806587300001",NA,"Owsley, Kelsey/0000-0002-3745-4976 Bauer, Kyla/0000-0003-0074-6374","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,64

This study examines changes in Mexican-heritage fathers' PA networks after participation in a father-focused, family-centered health program. Families consisting of child (aged 9-11 years), mother, and father were recruited from colonias on the Texas-Mexico border for participation in a 6-week father-focused, family-centered program concentrated on healthy eating and active living. Fathers reported up to 5 people with whom they were active most in the previous month before and after the program as well as how often they were active with the person and what activities they did most often. Multilevel regression models examined changes in networks. Fathers (n = 42; mean age = 39.07 years, SD = 7.45) were significantly more likely to report more frequent PA with others after the program as compared with before. General active play and conditional support were mentioned most frequently. This study provides context to the social networks and PA behaviors of Mexican-heritage fathers and suggests that a father-focused, family-centered health program can increase the PA frequency with social network connections.","10.1097/FCH.0000000000000319",NA,"0160-6379","1550-5057","WOS:000757900700007","Patterson, Megan S/U-5546-2018 Talbert, Tony L/D-6483-2015","Talbert, Tony L/0000-0003-4328-7526",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,67

Detection of these groups can be helpful in many applications, such as finding networks of protein interaction in biological networks, finding the users of similar mind for ads and suggestions, finding a shared research field in collaborative networks, analyzing public health, future link prediction in social networks, analyzing criminology, and many more. However, with the increase in the number of profiles and content shared on social media platforms, the analysis is often time-consuming and exhaustive. In order to speed up and optimize the community detection process, parallel processing and Shared/Distributed memory techniques are widely used. Despite community detection has widespread use in social networks, no attempt has ever been made to compile and systematically discuss research efforts on the emerging subject of identifying parallel and distributed methods for community detection in social networks. Most of the surveys described the serial algorithms used for community detection. Our survey work comes under the scope of new design techniques, exciting or novel applications, components or standards, and applications of an educational, transactional, and co-operational nature. This paper accommodates and presents a systematic literature review with state-of-the-art research on the application of parallel processing and Shared/Distributed techniques to determine communities for social network analysis. Advanced search strategy has been performed on several digital libraries for extracting several studies for the review. The systematic search landed in finding 3220 studies, among which 65 relevant studies are selected after conducting various screening phases for further review. The application of parallel computing, shared memory, and distributed memory on the existing community detection methodologies have been discussed thoroughly. More specifically, the central significance of this paper is that a systematic literature review is conducted to gather the relevant studies from different digital libraries and gray literature. Then, different parametric values of each selected study are appropriately compared. Moreover, the need for further research to speed up the process of community formation in parallel and shared approaches has been pinpointed more suitably.

To establish the potential of social network theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background. While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a ``bridging{''} role between the public and the scientific community. Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go beyond traditional metrics.","10.1371/journal.pone.0249302","e0249302","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000636336800033",NA,"Caduff, Anita/0000-0002-2736-2170 Rehm, Martin/0000-0002-9553-7008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,70

With the increasing use of social networks, relationships from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts. Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85\%. The evaluation shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time.","10.1007/s12559-020-09806-5",NA,"1866-9956","1866-9964","WOS:000604851700007",NA,"Beg, Mirza/0000-0001-5789-2933","JAN 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,91

This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of `actor-actants' and `issue-actants,' and between the adoption of `field' and `contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as \#hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the `echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.","10.1080/1369118X.2022.2032260",NA,"1369-118X","1468-4462","WOS:000753311300001","Cai, Xiaolan/HZH-9596-2023 ","Cai, Xiaolan/0000-0002-1708-7304 Khan, Md Irfanuzzaman/0000-0003-2671-7053 Holland, Kate/0000-0003-3873-5769 O'Neil, Mathieu/0000-0002-3537-9036","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,92

Little is known about the consequences of these impairments on peer relationships of ACP. This study applied social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2), dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3, Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4, standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship qualities moderated the relationship between pain and emotional distress. This study contributes to the literature on the importance of peer relationships of ACP.

Some researchers anticipate benefits stemming from improved public awareness of the value of vaccines while others worry concerns around vaccine development and public health mandates may have damaged public trust. There is a need to understand whether the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine mandates have influenced HPV vaccine attitudes and sentiments to inform health communication strategies.MethodsWe collected 596,987 global English-language tweets from January 2019-May 2021 using Twitter's Academic Research Product track. We determined vaccine confident and hesitant networks discussing HPV immunization using social network analysis. Then, we used a neural network approach to natural language processing to measure narratives and sentiment pertaining to HPV immunization.ResultsMost of the tweets in the vaccine hesitant network were negative in tone (54.9\%) and focused on safety concerns surrounding the HPV vaccine while most of the tweets in the vaccine confident network were neutral (51.6\%) and emphasized the health benefits of vaccination. Growth in negative sentiment among the vaccine hesitant network corresponded with legislative efforts in the State of New York to mandate HPV vaccination for public school students in 2019 and the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a Global Health Emergency in 2020. In the vaccine confident network, the number of tweets concerning the HPV vaccine decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic but in both vaccine hesitant and confident networks, the sentiments, and themes of tweets about HPV vaccine were unchanged.ConclusionsAlthough we did not observe a difference in narratives or sentiments surrounding the HPV vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased focus on the HPV vaccine among vaccine confident groups. As routine vaccine catch-up programs restart, there is a need to invest in health communication online to raise awareness about the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine.","10.1186/s12889-023-15615-w","694",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000969776100001","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/JLK-8537-2023 ","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/0000-0002-2755-7891 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96

However, little is known about how and why interorganizational cooperation occurs. The present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61 network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to examine network properties and exponential random graph models were estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the community department for education and sports being the most central network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in both the present and other research areas of health promotion.","10.1371/journal.pone.0260053","e0260053","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000755305800089",NA,"Wolbring, Laura/0000-0001-9596-1119 Woll, Alexander/0000-0002-5736-2980",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,98

The methodology applied was social network analysis by means of transitivity and homophily social triads. The data were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Results and conclusions A total of 58.48\% of rural adolescents consumed alcohol compared to 49.52\% of urban adolescents. These results demonstrate that adolescents who live in rural areas exhibit a greater risk of drinking alcohol than those who live in urban areas. The presence of transitive triads increases the probability of sharing sociodemographic attributes in such a way that it may be considered one of the causes of homophily, contributing to adolescents taking greater risks, such as consuming alcohol.","10.1371/journal.pone.0241135","e0241135","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000588375500021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,101

The severity of the disease depends on the route, dose and frequency of infection. Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the spread of the disease. LionsPanthera leoare social carnivores with individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other, a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so, within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear from a pride. Persistence of the disease as noted for lions in Kruger can only realize through unlikely transmissions or through feeding on infected prey.

Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430 birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.","10.1371/journal.pone.0252152","e0252152","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000664642200031","Fowler, James H/C-2750-2008 ","Witte, Carmel/0000-0001-9086-3333",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,114

Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\% of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential policy implications.","10.1007/s11606-019-05114-3",NA,"0884-8734","1525-1497","WOS:000495795700037","Aks, Steven/AAF-1924-2020 ","Hinami, Keiki/0000-0002-1927-2546 Trick, William/0000-0002-3243-5098",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,117

This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets. Reducing violence in the lives of homeless youth is imperative and can contribute to a young person's ability to safely and successfully exit the streets and lead a long and productive life in society. However, developing public health and social interventions to reduce violence in adolescent and young adult populations is difficult due to the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of this phenomenon. Los Angeles area homeless youth (N = 366) were asked questions regarding recent violence experiences, emotion regulation, and their social network. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the overall effect of emotion regulation on violence, controlling for age, gender, race, sexual identity, experience of childhood abuse, and data collection site. In this sample, 56\% of youth endorsed fighting in the previous year, and those who reported more difficulties with emotion regulation were significantly more likely to fight. In addition, youth who scored below the mean on difficulties with regulation and belonged to networks characterized by low-difficulty peers were 60\% less likely to report fighting. Emotion regulation skills represent a malleable target for intervention that may contribute to reduced propensity for violence in this population. Implications for network-based interventions to improve individual emotion regulation and reduce overall violence among homeless youth and other at-risk populations are discussed.","10.1177/0886260518804183",NA,"0886-2605","1552-6518","WOS:000660076900014",NA,"Barr, Nicholas/0000-0002-5167-9012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,119

To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. The low-carbon patent application is an important means to achieve these goals and promote public health. MethodsThis study analyzes the basic situation, spatial network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database. ResultsThe following findings are established. (1) From the number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing. (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including economic development, financial support, local scientific research level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level, the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban agglomerations.

Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing challenges in the development, implementation and evaluation of community pharmacy services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the foundation for building collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care. Objectives: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a collaborative initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in Andalucia (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders, differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder relationships. Method: Stakeholders were identified using the snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders and analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire was sent to 186 stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5) concerns; (6) whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they had with other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive qualitative content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis and social network analysis. Results: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated. The identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public health and science were the main driving interests. A collaboration network existed between the 96 stakeholders. Conclusion: This study revealed the magnitude of the social system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease.

Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time. Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated. Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study.

Leveraging systems science methods offers opportunities to approach PA in a manner which embraces its inherent complexity. This study describes how participatory systems mapping and social network analysis (SNA) were used to understand the work of local and national level walking systems in Ireland. Methods Two adapted participatory action research workshops with multisectoral stakeholders were used to develop a systems map for walking in Cork, Ireland. The Global Action Plan for Physical Activity 2018-2030 (GAPPA) map was used as a framework to categorize workshop outcomes. Secondly, SNA methods were used to analyse the communication network between partners of Get Ireland Walking, a national walking promotion initiative, as defined within their strategic plan and the actual communication network as experienced by the partners. Results The systems mapping process allowed stakeholders to identify 19 suggested actions for the Cork walking system. The SNA found that there were considerably fewer communication ties between partners in the actual communication network than in the strategy defined network. Conclusion The systems mapping process was a useful catalyst for engaging stakeholders in cross-sectoral communication and the GAPPA was a practical way to organize workshop outcomes. Social network analysis methods highlighted that the communication network of a national level walking promotion partnership is not working as planned. Overall, the use of systems science methods can provide practical insights for local and national level walking systems.","10.1093/eurpub/ckac076",NA,"1101-1262","1464-360X","WOS:000848634100003",NA,"Lambe, Barry/0000-0002-8876-3189 Murphy, Niamh/0000-0002-0176-2897 Power, Dylan/0000-0001-6829-2757",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,130

Setting It was carried out in an educational environment, in 11 classrooms belonging to 5 Schools in Ponferrada (Spain). Participants 235 adolescents were included in the study (49.4\% female), who were classified as normal weight or overweight. Primary and secondary outcome measures Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used to study the level of physical activity. A social network analysis was carried out to analyse structural variables of centrality in different degrees of contact. Results 30.2\% of the participants in our study were overweight. Relative to female participants in this study, males obtained significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A (OR: 2.11; 95\% CI: 1.04 to 4.25; p value: 0.036) and were more likely to participate in group sport (OR: 4.59; 95\% CI: 2.28 to 9.22; p value: 0.000). We found no significant relationship between physical activity and the weight status in the total sample, but among female participants, those with overweight status had higher odds of reporting high levels of physical exercise (OR: 4.50; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In terms of centrality, differentiating by gender, women who participated in group sports were more likely to be classified as having low values of centrality, while the opposite effect occurred for men, more likely to be classified as having high values of centrality.

May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the event had primary involvement from the United States and the United Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents, especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally. The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and global health.","10.7759/cureus.28997","e28997",NA,"2168-8184","WOS:000856781800007","Malhotra, Kashish/ABT-8009-2022 ","Malhotra, Kashish/0000-0002-6985-5731 Goyal, Kashish/0000-0002-6997-7691",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,134

PrEP uptake was associated with more utilization of health venues in Houston and higher levels of sexual risk behavior in Chicago. In Houston, both Hispanic and Black YMSM compared to White YMSM were less likely to take PrEP. No evidence was found to support the spread of PrEP uptake via referral networks, which highlights the need for more effective PrEP referral network systems to scale up PrEP implementation among at-risk YMSM.","10.1007/s10461-018-2327-7",NA,"1090-7165","1573-3254","WOS:000471709800003","Wang, Peng/AAV-7760-2021 Kuhns, Lisa/ABF-9280-2020 Amith, Muhammad/GZB-1844-2022 ","Wang, Peng/0000-0002-7701-561X Kuhns, Lisa/0000-0001-8294-7801 Amith, Muhammad/0000-0003-4333-1857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,136

We used a mixed-methods approach to assess collaborative relationships between multiple government sectors and civil society and to suggest possible health promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the urban poor in deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in health promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods. Participants included stakeholders working for or engaging in governments (3), public health care institutions (5), social service providers (3), community-based organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based organisations (3). We conducted semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and then collected survey data. Quantitative data were analysed using social network analysis, and qualitative data were analysed through iterative and consensus processes. The social network analysis indicated that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and controlling informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and communication, (2) need of a coalition with a committed leading actor for future collaboration and (3) organisational and political silos within and across public sectors. Increased understanding of the current status of and challenges to collaboration can inform the planning and implementation of complex intervening strategies and policies tailored to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods.

However, programs to promote PA among BCS tailored to real-world contexts within low- to middle-income countries are limited. Cross-sector co-creation can be key to effective and scalable programs for BCS in these countries. This study aimed to evaluate the networking process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation of a PA program for Colombian BCS called My Body. We employed a mixed-methods design including semistructured interviews, workshops and a social network analysis of centrality measures to assess stakeholders' engagement, resources and skills enabling the collaborative work, challenges, outcomes and lessons learned. The descriptive analysis and the centrality measures of the network revealed that 19 cross-sector stakeholders engaged in the My Body collaborative network. Through ongoing communication and cooperation, My Body built relationships between the academic lead institutions (local and international), and local and national public, private and academic institutions working in public health, sports and recreation, social sciences and engineering fields. The outcomes included the co-creation of the community-based PA program for BCS, its implementation through cross-sector synergies, increased relationships and communications among stakeholders, and successful dissemination of evidence and project results to the collaboration partners and other relevant stakeholders and community members. The mixed-methods assessment enabled understanding of ways to advance cross-sector co-creation of health promotion programs. The findings can help to enable continued development of sustainable cross-sector co-creation processes aimed at advancing PA promotion. Lay Summary Collaborative work among stakeholders and researchers from different governmental sectors and disciplinary fields can be key to design and implement effective and scalable programs to promote physical activity (PA) among breast cancer survivors (BCS).

While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients, healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively. This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods into the population oral health sciences.","10.1111/cdoe.12824",NA,"0301-5661","1600-0528","WOS:000928837400001",NA,"Baker, Sarah/0000-0002-2861-451X","FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,146

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. Objective: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. Methods: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. Results: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","10.2196/27009","e27009","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000636206700004","Qian, Yuxing/ABI-3343-2020 ","Qian, Yuxing/0000-0002-3803-2505 Wang, Dandan/0000-0002-5319-5820",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,148

The strategy diagram showed that the epidemiology, etiology, and drug therapy of PE were well advanced. In contrast, studies on diagnostic imaging, pathology, and complications of PE were still immature and offered potential research space. Social network analysis showed that marginal topics such as surgical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, prevention and control of postoperative complications, and metabolism and analysis of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were emerging research hotspots. ConclusionObjective analysis of the research developments in the field of PE can provide intuitive knowledge structure for researchers and clinicians. Analysis of the research hotspots related to PE is helpful for researchers and clinicians by highlighting future research directions.","10.3389/fmed.2023.1052928","1052928",NA,"2296-858X","WOS:000945475100001","Fan, Jingjing/AAS-9918-2021","Fan, Jingjing/0000-0002-1110-5735",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,151

Compare companies spending the most; types of organisations receiving payments and types of payments in the four countries. Measure the extent to which companies target payments at the same recipients in each country and whether it differs depending on the type of recipient. Design Cross-sectional comparative and social network analysis. Setting England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland. Participants 100 donors (pharmaceutical companies) reporting payments to 4229 recipients (healthcare organisations and patient organisations) in 2015. Main outcome measures For each country: payment totals and distribution; average number of common recipients between companies; share of payments to organisations fulfilling different roles in the health ecosystem and payments for different activities. Results Companies prioritised different types of recipient and different types of activity in each country. There were significant differences in the distribution of payments across the four countries, even for similar types of recipients. Recipients in England and Wales received smaller individual payments than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Overall, targeting shared recipients occurred most frequently in England, but was also common in certain pockets of each country's health ecosystem. We found evidence of reporting errors in Disclosure UK. Conclusions Our findings suggest a strategic approach to payments tailored to countries' policy and decision-making context, indicating there may be specific vulnerabilities to financial conflicts of interest at subnational level. Payment differences between countries may be occurring in other countries, particularly those with decentralised health systems and/or high levels of independence across its decision-making authorities. We call for a single database containing all recipient types, full location details and published with associated descriptive and network statistics.","10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061591","e061591","2044-6055",NA,"WOS:000991985100004",NA,"Ozieranski, Piotr/0000-0002-2023-3288 Rickard, Emily/0000-0003-2251-0127",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,153

This is demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service, funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A description of the system thinking methodology and its associated methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft system methodology are described with examples in the health care setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However, many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care. Conclusion: It is important that methods to implement systems thinking methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.","10.1097/XEB.0000000000000303",NA,"2691-3321",NA,"WOS:000783723400002","khalil, hanan/AAX-4188-2021","khalil, hanan/0000-0002-3302-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,154

Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network analysis (SNA). Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research.

However, conventional prevention and control strategies, which only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently decrease the number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode is needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to analyze how these social organizations cooperate with others and further identify the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of the actor's attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220 participants in 19 social organizations. The results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the network between social organizations became more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and e/s > 2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all except the ``same age group effect (-1.02){''}. The results also indicated that the social organizations tend to build relationships with more active actors in the community in every time period. This paper is of great significance regarding the innovation of public health system management and the improvement of Chinese grassroots governance.","10.3390/ijerph20021409","1409",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000915064400001","Zhou, Dan/AAG-4315-2020","Zhou, Dan/0000-0001-8941-4223",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,159

Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19. Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted. Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative.

Systems science may be well suited to tackle such wicked problems. While there is a growing application of systems thinking tools and resources in public health, there are fewer examples that incorporate both systems tools and systemic inquiry processes. Prevention Tracker offered an opportunity to trial the combination of systems tools and systems thinking at the level of community chronic disease prevention efforts. Our methodology comprised four Domains of Inquiry. 1. Describing a prevention system 2. Guiding system change efforts 3. Monitoring change 4. Cross case comparison. We applied systems tools and methods to investigate each domain of inquiry such as group model building, social network analysis, graphic illustration, causal loop diagrams and system action learning. These methods were connected through the application of systemic inquiry processes that elevated the ongoing interrogation of boundary judgments, awareness of diverse and multiple perspectives, interrelationships and the importance of social learning. Prevention Tracker demonstrated that it is possible to apply a range of systems methods while also keeping focus on the overall systems science and the need for theoretical consistency. The four domains of inquiry enabled flexibility to adapt our approach in each context to learn and improve. This methodological capacity to learn and adapt may also be useful in tackling other health and social problems, such as the COVID19 pandemic.

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.","10.2196/22609","e22609","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000602398100006","Al-Khalifa, Hend/AAY-5219-2020 alSaeed, Duaa/AAU-9469-2020 Al-Khalifa, Hend S./F-3945-2011 AlBaity, Heyam/AAJ-7949-2021","Al-Khalifa, Hend/0000-0002-7328-4935 alSaeed, Duaa/0000-0002-8464-7279 Al-Khalifa, Hend S./0000-0002-7328-4935 AlBaity, Heyam/0000-0002-4590-3399",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165

It is an urgent problem to be solved for firms how to make use of internal knowledge and external power to help firms' sustainable innovation (FSI). Thus, the purpose of this study is to deeply analyze how firms' internal knowledge diversity (KD) and external ego-network structures {[}ego-network density (ED) and honest brokers (HB)] affect FSI, as well as how the ego-network structures (ED and HB) moderate the relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of the ego network. Design/methodology/approachBased on the data of the alliance innovation networks of China's new energy industries in 2009-2019, this study uses the social network analysis method and negative binomial regression model to explore the effect of KD and ego-network structures (ED and HB) on FSI, as well as the moderating effects of ego-network structures (ED and HB) on the relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of ego network. FindingsThis study finds that KD, ED and HB can boost FSI. Moreover, ED plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between KD and FSI. However, the negative moderating effect of HB on the relationship between KD and FSI is not significant.

To date, no network of a health-promoting university has been examined regarding the processes underlying tie formation, network emergence, and maintenance.Objectives and methods The goals of this study are to obtain insight into the mechanisms of cooperation between university actors in a health-promoting network and to identify the structural and attributive factors associated with establishing cooperation between actors in the observed network in order to better understand how to build and develop successful networks in the future. For this purpose, a social network analysis was carried out and exponential random graph models were estimated to test corresponding hypotheses.Results The network at hand consists of 33 actors (e.g. University Sports Center, General Student Committee) and shows a flat, non-hierarchical structure. Data reveal that attributed competence predicts cooperation (0.32; p < 0.05). Significant homophily effects among student actors (1.31; p < 0.05) and among university actors (0.59; p < 0.05) were found. All structural predictors examined were significant (0.22-5.40; p < 0.05) and are therefore essential in determining the likelihood of cooperation between actors involved in the network.Conclusion The results of this study provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cooperation and can be used to further develop the network at hand (e.g. selection of key actors for information dissemination or integration of peripheral actors). In addition, the findings offer starting points for sustained network development at other universities (e.g. significance of network governance form or goal consensus). Knowing the factors that influence the network structure, here the conditions of cooperation, results in opportunities to encourage empowerment among actors. However, the analysis of the network undertaken does not directly bear on the success of the network.","10.1186/s12889-023-16786-2","1911",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:001076952500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,168

In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal \& child health (MCH) and water \& sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries. Method An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH. Results Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.","10.1371/journal.pone.0219786","e0219786","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000482331900044","Gupta, Shivam/JNE-3789-2023 ","Adhikari, Binita/0000-0002-7554-2889 Hoe, Connie/0000-0001-8008-4010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,169

Design: This study used a social network analysis (SNA) approach to assess the Million Hearts initiative network partnerships and identify potential implications for policy and practice. Setting/Participants: The Million Hearts network comprised a core group of federal and private sector partners that participate in Million Hearts activities and align with initiative priorities. To bound the network for the SNA, we used a list of 58 organizations (74\% response rate) from a previously completed qualitative analysis of Million Hearts partnerships. Main Outcome Measures: We used the online PARTNER (Program to Analyze Record and Track Networks to Enhance Relationships-) survey to collect data on individual organizational characteristics and relational questions that asked organizations to identify and describe their relationships with other partners in the network. Key SNA measures include network density, centralizations, value, and trust. Results: Our analyses show a network that is decentralized, has strong perceptions of trust and value among its members, and strong agreement on intended outcomes. Interestingly, partners report a desire and ability to contribute resources to Million Hearts; however, the perceptions between partners are that resources are not being contributed at the level they potentially could be. The majority of partners reported that being in the network helped them achieve their goals related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The largest barrier to successful activities within the network was cited as lack of targeted funding and staff to support participation in the network. Conclusions: The Million Hearts network described in this article is unique in its membership at the national level, agreement on outcomes, its powerful information-sharing abilities that require few resources, and its decentralized structure.

People in this region have similar traditions or respect the same religion. There is no difference in lifestyle and food culture. Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar (a reference area). This study provided the behavior-related risk factors for OV-CCA among people in five GMS Countries which would be a major jigsaw puzzle leading to proactive surveillance for OV-CCA prevention in the future.","10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.105221","105221","0001-706X","1873-6254","WOS:000500186700027","Le, Cua Ngoc/IRZ-5264-2023 ","Sripa, Banchob/0000-0001-8899-5919 Nguyen, Thi To Uyen/0000-0003-3049-4841 Le, Cua Ngoc/0000-0001-5634-7669",NA,"NTD-Asia-International-Research-Network Conference, Khon Kean, THAILAND, AUG 07-09, 2019","NTD Asia Int Res Network",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,171

Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683","105683","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000833401100005","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Dietze, Klaas/JJF-6743-2023 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Dietze, Klaas/0000-0002-6138-6707 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

Conversely, network closure perpetuates conformity, increases the influence of social norms, and induces less confidence in individual's ability to comply with cervical cancer screening, subjecting Latinas to unnecessary health risks. Overall, the results suggest that the study of normative influence should be combined with social network analysis, trying to shed a light on the distinct social structures and communication practices that can either reinforce or challenge norms. These findings extend the discussion of social norms in health-related decision making to a more nuanced approach that recognizes the antecedents and outcomes of normative influence.","10.1177/0093650217718655",NA,"0093-6502","1552-3810","WOS:000469841700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,174

Simultaneously, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in mobile health apps. Objective: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations. Methods: We first studied the users' needs and gathered users' graphical preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150 design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics, diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to test feasibility. Results: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4 specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical activity, social network, user's status score, and project information. We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11\%), 5 overweight people (7\%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4 kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10 minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting 30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities. Conclusions: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical activity, BMI, and specific diseases. Besides, the chatbot allows the connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity causes from both individual and social perspectives.","10.2196/17503","e17503",NA,"2291-9694","WOS:000646051700001","Li, Yu-Chuan/E-9476-2011 Garcia-Gomez, Juan M/G-2681-2016 Fernandez-Luque, Luis/C-6723-2011 Conejero, J.

Some are new risks from urban construction, while some are traditional risks that belong to this coastal area. The joint efforts of these risks may lead to new hazards, harming public health, but this problem has not been noticed in previous studies. Therefore, this study constructs the Triangular Framework for Safety Risk in New Towns to identify the risks and proposes strategies to reduce the risks. In this study, multiple methods are integrated, including Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Social Network Analysis (SNA). This study takes the Lin-gang Special Area in China as a case study to verify the framework's effectiveness. Sixteen disaster-causing factors are identified, and the internal linkages among these factors are clarified. Results show that the hybrid method performs well in quantitatively analyzing the risk factors of new coastal towns. A typhoon, public risk perception, and population migration are essential influencing factors. Disaster prevention capability of high-rise buildings, disaster prevention capacity of port facilities, and transportation are the most direct influencing factors. Environmental degradation is the most conductive among all elements. This study contributes to the theoretical theory by proposing an effective framework to analyze the safety risks in new coastal towns. In addition, it provides practical references for governments to make emergency plans in the city.","10.3390/ijerph191710496","10496",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000852868400001","Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013 ","Linyan, Chen/0000-0002-3843-2664",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,177

Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. Methods This paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors. Results The results show that commercial actors' positions on e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs, independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Conclusion Awareness of the various commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3.","10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056084",NA,"0964-4563","1468-3318","WOS:000728273000001",NA,"Hilton, Shona/0000-0003-0633-8152 Wong, Mark Tsun On/0000-0002-5683-8684 Buckton, Christina/0000-0002-6004-4334 Ikegwuonu, Theresa/0000-0001-6633-8512 Smith, Katherine/0000-0002-1060-4102","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,179

In this context, this paper uses the joint invention patent of Shenzhen, a low-carbon pilot city of China, to investigate the dynamics of network influencing factors. The social network analysis shows that the scale of coinvention network of NEVs is constantly increasing, which is featured with diversified cooperative entities, and collaboration depth (i.e., the intensity of the interactions with these partners) is also expanding. The empirical results from the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) demonstrate that, with the deepening of collaborative innovation, technological upgrading caused by knowledge exchange makes organizations in the network more inclined to cognitive proximity and less dependent on geographical proximity. In addition, organizational proximity and triadic closure contribute positively to the collaborative network, with their relevance remaining nearly the same, while the impeding effect of cultural/language difference is slightly decreasing with time.","10.1155/2021/6665945","6665945","1076-2787","1099-0526","WOS:000617611800001",NA,"Chong, Zhaohui/0000-0001-6362-7140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,182

Community-clinical partnerships offer particular promise, but delivery and sustainment of preventive services through these systems face several challenges related to service integration and collaboration. We used a social network analysis perspective to explore (a) the range of contributions made by community-clinical partnership network members to support the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and (b) important influences on the ability of these partnerships to sustain service delivery. Methods:Data come from an implementation evaluation of the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund initiative, which supported nine Massachusetts communities to coordinate delivery of evidence-based prevention and address inequities in hypertension, pediatric asthma, falls among older adults, or tobacco use. In 2016, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (a) leadership teams representing nine community-level partnerships and (b) practitioners from four high-implementation partnerships (n= 23). We managed data using NVivo11 and utilized a framework analysis approach. Results:Key network contributions for delivery of evidence-based preventive services included creating referrals, delivering services, providing links to community members, and administration and leadership. Less emphasized contributions included wraparound services, technical assistance, and venue provision. Implementers from high-implementation partnerships also highlighted contributions such as program adaptation, creating buy-in, and sharing information to improve service delivery. Expected drivers of program sustainability included the ability to develop a business case, ongoing network facilitation, technology support, continued integrated action, and sufficient staffing to maintain programming. Conclusion:The study highlights the need to take a long-term, infrastructure-focused approach when designing community-clinical partnerships. Strategic partnership composition, including identifying sources of necessary network contributions, in conjunction with efforts from the outset to link systems, align effort, and build a long-term funding structure can support the required coordinated action around preventive services needed to improve health equity.","10.3389/fpubh.2020.00213","213",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000551642900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,184

The results show that infection was positively associated with procuring fish from ponds, but negatively associated with procuring fish from rivers. Incorporating fish procurement sites substantially increases network connectivity, reinforcing the human connection to key fish sources as a potential risk factor for infection.

Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and future developments in this field. Methods: The bibliometric techniques were applied in the analysis of publications on CEPH in Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson Reuters. One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of publications, including distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection, were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and evolution of CEPH. Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic actions. Based on keyword clustering and co-citation clustering, we propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome) framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the future. Conclusion: This study draws an outline of the global review on the contemporary and cross-disciplinary research of CEPH which might present an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are fundamental to inform policy making.","10.1186/s13690-021-00525-3","6","0778-7367","2049-3258","WOS:000609488000001","Lin, Han/X-5326-2019 Wang, Xuemei/GXF-3702-2022 yuan, ming/JPL-4196-2023 Lin, Han/GRF-1081-2022","Lin, Han/0000-0001-5136-5059 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,186

Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.","10.1111/tbed.14351",NA,"1865-1674","1865-1682","WOS:000714419500001","wang, youming/HJB-0541-2022 ","CAI, CHANG/0000-0002-1122-3045 Tang, Hao/0000-0002-3932-4016 Bruce, Mieghan/0000-0003-3176-2094","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,188

This bibliometric analysis (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100 most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations. Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100 most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded. Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation coefficients (CC). Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were excluded because they do not have MeSH terms). Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top 100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and other academic disciplines.","10.1186/s12991-021-00329-3","6",NA,"1744-859X","WOS:000609471900001","smile, chien/AAA-1053-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,189

This study applies an innovative combination of relative risk and social network analysis to enrolment data of a single cohort of commencing students from an Australian regional university. Relative risk, often used in epidemiology studies, is used to strategically investigate whether first year mathematics subjects at the university demonstrated a higher risk of attrition when compared to other subjects offered in the first year of study. The network analysis is used to illustrate the connections of those mathematics subjects, identifying service subjects through their multiple connections. The analysis revealed that attrition rates for eight of the nine subjects were within acceptable limits, and this included identified service subjects.

Mixed methods combining qualitative interviews with 24 organisations and Social Network Analysis with 75 organisations were completed in 2018 in two communities (Denton, TX and Sarasota, FL) with robust examples of health and social systems alignment. Findings suggest that while community organisations are embedded in robust cross-sector networks, the potential increase in referrals from clinical settings is not something they are fully aware of, or prepared for, as evidenced by inadequate funding models, misalignment between capacity and capability, and a lack of coordination on screening and referral activities. Misalignment between clinical and CBO understanding of demand, needs and capacity present a potential risk in building strategies that integrate health and social services to address unmet social need. Failing to build a strong cross-sector screening and referral infrastructure that considers CBO capacity from the start could undermine the goal of improving population health through the integration of clinical and social care.","10.1111/hsc.13109",NA,"0966-0410","1365-2524","WOS:000553118400001",NA,"Ely, Todd/0000-0003-3580-5493","JUL 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,195

This study sought to examine the effect of post-traumatic stress disorder in adolescence on the risk for antisocial personality disorder diagnosis in adulthood and the relevance of differences in developmental patterns of degree of association with antisocial peers in adolescence as an additional risk factor. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses, comprising the longitudinal responses of 1,354 juvenile offenders who had recently been adjudicated for a serious offense prior to baseline measurement. Logistic regression was used to examine these relationships.

This calls for systems-based approaches that facilitate the kind of collective and collaborative thinking and working required to address complexity. While the literature on systems thinking, system dynamics and the associated methodologies is extensive, there remains little clear guidance on how to plan, govern and implement participatory systems approaches within a co-creation process.MethodsWe used a three-step process to develop DISCOVER, a framework for implementing, and governing systems-based co-creation:Stage 1: We conducted a literature analysis of key texts to identify well-documented methods and phases for co-creation using a systems approach, as well as areas where gaps existed.Stage 2: We looked for the most appropriate methods and approaches to fill the gaps in the knowledge production chain.Stage 3: We developed the framework, identifying how the different tools and approaches fit together end-to-end, from sampling and recruiting participants all the way through to responding with an action plan.ResultsWe devised DISCOVER to help guide researchers and stakeholders to collectively respond to complex social, health and wider problems. DISCOVER is a strategic research planning and governance framework that provides an actionable, systematic way to conceptualise complex problems and move from evidence to action, using systems approaches and co-creation. In this article, we introduce the eight-step framework and provide an illustrative case study showcasing its potential. The framework integrates complementary approaches and methods from social network analysis, systems thinking and co-creation literature. The eight steps are followed sequentially but can overlap.ConclusionsDISCOVER increases rigour and transparency in system approaches to tackling complex issues going from planning to action.

We examine implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) adopted by the World Health Organization in 2003 and ratified by approximately 94\% of countries as of 2016. We constructed five networks: (1) geographic distance, (2) general trade, (3) tobacco trade, (4) GLOBALink referrals, and (5) GLOBALink co-subscriptions. Network exposure terms were constructed from these networks based on the implementation scores for six articles of the FCTC treaty. We estimate effects using a lagged Type 1 Tobit model. Results show that network effects were significant: (a) across all networks for article 6 (pricing and taxation), (b) distance, general trade, GL referrals, and GL co-subscriptions for article 8 (second hand smoke), (c) distance, general trade, and GL co-subscriptions for article 11 (packaging and labeling), and (d) distance and GL co-subscription for article 13 (promotion and advertising), (e) tobacco trade and GL co-subscriptions for article 14 (cessation). These results indicate that diffusion effects were more prevalent for pricing and taxation as well as restrictions on smoking in public places and packaging and labeling. These results suggest that network influences are possible in domains that are amenable to control by national governments but unlikely to occur in domains established by existing regulatory systems.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination debate sparked controversial debates on social media platforms such as Twitter, which can lead to serious consequences for public health. What determines anti-vax attitudes is an important question for understanding the source of the campaigns and mitigating the misinformation spread. Compared with other countries, Turkiye differentiates itself with high vaccination rates and lack of political support for anti-vaxxers despite its highly polarized political system. Analyzing Turkish Twittersphere, we explore several mechanisms capturing content production and behaviors of accounts within the pro- and anti-vax segments in online vaccine-related discussions. Our findings indicate there is no relation between political stance and anti-vaccine attitude. Both supporters of vaccination (pro-vaxxers) and opponents (anti-vaxxers) can be found across the political spectrum. Moreover, linguistic differences reveal that anti-vaxxers employ more emotional language, while pro-vaxxers express more skepticism. Notably, automated accounts are less prevalent leading to difficulty in assessing genuine support for vaccines, while anti-vaccine bots produce slightly more content. These findings have crucial implications for vaccine policy, emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse language patterns and beliefs among anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers to develop effective communication strategies at the national level.","10.1177/20563051241229657","20563051241229657","2056-3051",NA,"WOS:001160652600001",NA,"Varol, Onur/0000-0002-3994-6106",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,206

To date, there is limited evidence on how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and physical activity providers as well as sports administrating organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations; Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central actors (preferential attachment effect). Organizations from different sectors cooperated more often than organizations from the same sector (heterophily effect). Conclusion: The study provided valid and robust findings on significant mechanisms and conditions of interorganizational cooperation in community networks focused on sport and physical activity promotion. Based on the results, implications for the development and most efficient governance of these networks can be derived.","10.1186/s12889-022-14383-3","1966",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000873884600002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,209

We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was applied to test the association between network measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters, yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics.

All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic.

We provide a case study of systems science application to address geographic CVD health disparities at the community level - informing the science of CVD health disparities research. MethodsWe conducted a two-phased, multi-methods needs assessment in the Denver, Colorado area. Phase I consisted of a social network analysis to map a two-mode network of existing CVD prevention interventions and their implementing organizations. In Phase II, group model building (GMB) sessions with key community, public health, and healthcare provider stakeholders, were utilized to identify and visualize community factors contributing to disparities in CVD risk, producing a consensus-based causal loop diagram. ResultsBetween May 2021 and June 2022, we conducted 24 virtual, semi-structured interviews in Phase I to describe CVD prevention interventions, and 7 virtual GMB sessions in Phase II to describe experiences of disparities in CVD risk. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on a subset of results for both phases. In Phase I we identified 89 active CVD prevention interventions, 29 of which addressed tobacco use. In Phase II, causal loop diagrams revealed root causes of disparities in CVD risk. We provide an example of a causal loop diagram that focuses on the community prevalence of tobacco use, identifying stress as a key underlying factor driving disparities. The integration of findings from both phases highlighted the alignment and misalignment between quit tobacco intervention goals and how they are being experienced in marginalized communities. ConclusionSystems science methods were useful to organize a large number of CVD prevention efforts, and evaluate the root causes of CVD health disparities in a high risk community. By integrating these two aspects, interventions may be reoriented to more effectively address the root causes of CVD health disparities.","10.3389/fcvm.2023.1216436","1216436","2297-055X",NA,"WOS:001034163700001",NA,"Haapanen, Krista/0000-0002-5014-3363",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,218

However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S. Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10\% of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread. Author summary Epidemiologists increasingly use social networks to understand how geography, demographics, and human mobility affect disease spread and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. While highly detailed data on human social networks are now available, the size and density of these modern networks makes them computationally intensive to study. To address this challenge, we study methods for reducing a network to its most important links. Following recent work in computer science, we use the effective resistance, which takes both local and global connectivity into account. We test this method in simulations on a U.S.-wide mobility network and find that it preserves epidemic dynamics with high fidelity. Combined with efficient epidemic simulation algorithms, our approach can facilitate a more effective response to epidemics.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010650","e1010650","1553-734X","1553-7358","WOS:000926070200002",NA,"Mercier, Alexander/0000-0001-6295-1416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,220

These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (similar to 94\%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7\% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50\%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.","10.3390/microorganisms9020227","227",NA,"2076-2607","WOS:000622821000001","Pozo, Pilar/CAG-1393-2022 Alvarez, Julio/H-8292-2013 Pozo, Pilar/O-1728-2018 Grisi-Filho, Jose/J-2523-2012","Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873 Alvarez, Julio/0000-0002-8999-9417 Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353 Grisi-Filho, Jose/0000-0002-3263-2147",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,221

The authors examined the associations of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are important to assess the direction of the association between social isolation and cognitive performance.

However, whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated with future hallucinatory experiences. Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory experiences three years later than children who were not involved in bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim = 1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks, but not peer acceptance networks, were associated with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection = 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024). Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable for psychotic experiences.","10.1111/acps.13282",NA,"0001-690X","1600-0447","WOS:000618556900001","Tiemeier, Henning/H-6534-2019 Hillegers, Manon/L-6794-2016","Tiemeier, Henning/0000-0002-4395-1397 Steenkamp, Lisa/0000-0003-2953-4797 Hillegers, Manon/0000-0003-4877-282X","FEB 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,223

The lessons learned from the S\&T response of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focusof patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.","10.1186/s12889-019-6842-x","530",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000467609400002","FONSECA, FERNANDA/HDN-9451-2022 Fonseca, Fernanda/V-3446-2019 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/AAD-8584-2020 ","FONSECA, FERNANDA/0000-0002-0315-6479 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/0000-0002-4135-4011 Guindalini, Camila/0000-0002-6278-5881 Fonseca, Bruna de Paula/0000-0002-8795-2578 Fonseca, Fernanda/0000-0001-6852-6912",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,224

Frailty seems to behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter. Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was the main purpose of our study. Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012, mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning, and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms, hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and tertiles of the total FI score. Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8\% were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how the nodes are connected changed. Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network. Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of frailty in older adults.","10.1016/j.exger.2019.110747","110747","0531-5565","1873-6815","WOS:000498165000013","PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/B-7265-2011 GarcÃ­a-PeÃ±a, Carmen/F-1468-2011 ","PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/0000-0003-4374-976X GarcÃ­a-PeÃ±a, Carmen/0000-0002-9380-6964 Parra-Rodriguez, Lorena/0000-0002-1107-1571 Gomez Verjan, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-7186-8067",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,226

Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board, the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics boards of each participating study centre.

To improve system efficiency and continuity of care, the Hierarchical Medical System (HMS) policy package was issued in November 2014 and fully implemented in 2015 in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the HMS on the local healthcare system. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study with quarterly data collected between 2010 and 2018 from Yinzhou district, Ningbo. The data were analysed with an interrupted time series design to assess the impact of HMS on the changes in levels and trends of three outcome variables: primary care physicians' (PCPs') patient encounter ratio (i.e. the mean quarterly number of patient encounters of PCPs divided by that of all other physicians), PCP degree ratio (i.e. the mean degree of PCPs divided by the mean degree of all other physicians, with the mean degree revealing the mean activity and popularity of physicians, which reflected the extent to which he/she coordinated with others in delivering health services), and PCP betweenness centrality ratio (i.e. the mean betweenness centrality of PCPs divided by the mean betweenness centrality of all other physicians; the mean betweenness centrality was interpreted as the mean relative importance of physicians within the network, indicating the centrality of the network). Observed results were compared with counterfactual scenarios computed based on pre-HMS trends. Between January 2010 and December 2018, 272 267 patients visited doctors for hypertension, a representative non-communicable disease with a high prevalence of 44.7\% among adults aged 35-75 years, amounting to a total of 9 270 974 patient encounters. We analysed quarterly data of 45 464 observations over 36 time points. Compared to the counterfactual, by the fourth quarter of 2018, the PCP patient encounter ratio rose by 42.7\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 27.1-58.2, P < 0.001], the PCP degree ratio increased by 23.6\% (95\%CI: 8.6-38.5, P < 0.01) and the PCP betweenness centrality ratio grew by 129.4\% (95\%CI: 87.1-171.7, P < 0.001). The HMS policy can incentivize patients to visit primary care facilities and enhance the centrality of PCPs within their professional network.","10.1093/heapol/czad018",NA,"0268-1080","1460-2237","WOS:000950920700001","li, jixiang/JXN-7599-2024 Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024 Wei, Wei/JVM-8876-2024 wang, rui/JAC-6240-2023 ","Wei, Wei/0000-0002-4109-3878 Li, Huangqianyu/0000-0001-8744-0276","MAR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,228

Corzo","Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus","PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE",2020,"178",NA,NA,"MAY","Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity. Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways, though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p < 0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon heterogeneities in network connectivity.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104977","104977","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000533510200014","Makau, Dennis/I-2883-2019 Paploski, Igor/D-7015-2014","Makau, Dennis/0000-0002-1802-2545 VanderWaal, Kimberly/0000-0002-5764-6430 Paploski, Igor/0000-0002-3689-2042",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,230

This study also presents a set of actionable recommendations arising from the results.Methodology and methodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 purposively recruited Medical Officers of Health and epidemiologists from across Canada working in the field of substance use. Thematic and social network analysis guided by the socio-technical systems framework were subsequently employed.ResultsBarriers and facilitators for detecting emerging drug trends in provinces and territories are a product of the collective linkages and interactions between social (objectives, people, culture), technical (tools, practices, infrastructure), and external environmental (financial, regulatory frameworks, stakeholders) factors. Shortcomings in several of these areas shaped the system's behaviour and together contributed to fragmented operations that lacked strategic focus, poorly designed cross-sector partnerships, and unactionable information outputs. Participants' experiences shaped perceptions of a national substance use EWS, with some voicing potential opportunities and others expressing doubts about its effectiveness.ConclusionThis study highlights interconnected social, technical, and external environmental considerations for the design and implementation of a national substance use EWS in Canada. It also demonstrates the value of using the socio-technical systems framework to understand a complex public health surveillance issue and how it can be used to inform a path forward.

NodeXL Pro software was used to collect tweets using the terms 'food' and 'poverty' in any order somewhere in a tweet sent on selected days between April 5 and May 23, 2020. The data obtained from NodeXL Pro were cleaned. Social network analysis tools were used to analyse and visualise our data. Using this method, sentiment-related words (positive or negative words), the top (the most mentioned) 10 hashtags, top words and top word pairs were identified. The patterns of word pairs communicated in our network were visualised based on each word pair's frequency. This also enabled us to carry out a content analysis to create coding of the word pairs' data. A total of 81 249 tweets were identified that contained the terms 'food' and 'poverty'. Our findings revealed that individuals' tweets overwhelmingly contained views about the increase in hunger, food poverty and food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter users perceived that when the pandemic measures began, many food-secure families were pushed into food insecurity due to a rapid rise in unemployment and rising poverty due to the quarantine and stay-at-home instructions in place at the time. They also addressed the sharp rise in food poverty being driven by panic buying, food shortages, food affordability and disruptions in food supply and food systems. Our analysis of this data suggests that to mitigate food poverty or to prevent a 'hunger pandemic' for future pandemic emergencies, comprehensive and longer term policy responses and economic supports are needed to strengthen the resilience of food systems. However, the highlighted limitations of this study must be considered.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","COVID-19; Twitter data; coronavirus; food poverty; pandemic; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,237

During adolescence, many changes can cause stress. In this phase, the group of friends becomes increasingly important, being a situation of vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an escape mechanism or due to peer's influence. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the structure of the consumption and friendship network, the intention to use cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: An online platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were used for data collection. RESULTS: The sample consisted of adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from a third-year class of compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (Le{\'o}n, Spain). Significant differences were obtained concerning consumption intention and the different network metrics in both the friendship and consumption networks. Subsequently, the representation of these networks was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Social Network Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a picture of the context in which adolescents are located.

Reasons for that increase remain unclear, but the inter-organizational arrangement of organ donation programs may have contributed. However, there is a paucity of literature investigating these inter-organizational arrangements, with a limited understanding of how communication facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may help to re-establish rising organ donation rates post-pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe interprofessional interactions of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) during organ donation cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, from an organizational perspective (describing structure, context, process). METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA) approach analyzing 14 organ donation cases just before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social network graphs depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with a great part of the communication being processed through the OTDC. CONTEXT: Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across cases, and health care professionals perceived an atmosphere of shared vision and trust among team members. PROCESS: Most networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a decentralized information flow, and participants perceived decisions being jointly made. The characteristic path length of cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, suggesting potential for rapid information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced the OTDC role of intermediator within the communication process, and hospital staff perceived OTDCs as central players. Hospital staff and OTDCs reported frustration with some aspects of the flow of information during the organ allocation processes. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide a network map of communications within organ donation cases and reinforce the importance of the OTDC role.

An understanding of livestock movement patterns is needed to understand national transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that helps to describe the relationships among individuals and the implications of those relationships. We used SNA to describe the contact structure of livestock movements throughout the contiguous U.S. from April 1(st), 2015 to March 31(st), 2016. We describe 4 network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminant. Livestock movement data were sourced from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) while county-level farm demographic data were from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described networks, nodes are represented by counties and arcs by shipments between nodes; the networks were weighted based on the number of shipments between nodes. For the analyses, movement data were aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. Measures of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification of trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the study period, a total of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef cattle movements accounted for 63 \% of all movements. At least 70 \% of U.S. counties were present in each of the networks, but the density of arcs was less than 2\% in all networks. In the beef cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly correlated (0.8) with the number of beef cows per county while for the dairy cattle network a strong correlation (>0.86) was found with the number of dairy cattle per km(2) at the county level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large communities (50 counties or more per community), and were geographically clustered except for the communities in the small ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses can help to understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants. They may also be used in conjunction with simulation modeling to evaluate spread of highly infectious disease such as foot-and-mouth disease at the national level and to evaluate the application of intervention strategies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection; Livestock traceability; Social network analysis; U.S. livestock industry","en",NA,NA,NA,250

Taking into account the severe health consequences, the Emergency Department (ED), may offer an opportunity to recognize when an aggression is part of the spectrum of violence. This study applies Social Network analysis (SNA) to ED data in the Lazio region with the objective to identify patterns of diagnoses, within all the ED accesses of women experiencing an aggression, that are signals for gender-based violence against women. We aim to develop a risk assessment tool for ED professionals in order to strength their ability to manage victims of violence. METHODS: A cohort of 124,691 women aged 15-70 with an ED visit for aggression between 2003 and 2015 was selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and traumas was reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses and traumas, including also 9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA community detection algorithms and network centrality measures were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly associated to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the capability of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of having an history of violence. Model results were summed up into a risk chart. RESULTS: Among women experiencing an aggression, SNA identified four communities representing specific violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a central role in the violence network were alcohol or substance abuse, pregnancy-related conditions and psychoses. These high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 20\% of our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and predictive power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified through the SNA are meaningful in the violence recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women. Increasing the available number of predictors, such procedures may be proven to support ED staff in identifying early signs of violence to adequately support the victims and mitigate the harms.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Emergency department; First line screening; Gender-based violence; Patterns of diagnoses; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,251

Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION: In young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol.

It is observed that the number of articles on the subject remained at a low level before 2020, probably because the practical significance of the contact tracing model was not widely accepted by the academic community. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented research boom to contact tracing, as evidenced by the explosion of the literature after 2020. Tuberculosis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases were common types of diseases studied in contact tracing before 2020. In contrast, research on contact tracing regarding COVID-19 occupies a significantly large proportion after 2000.

In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. METHODS: Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61\% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION: Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,259

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest hospital outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA). METHODS: We constructed a directed relational network and calculated network metrics for 'degree', 'betweenness', 'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network components and modularity to identify sub-network structures with disproportionately big effects. RESULTS: We detected 68 connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 27 (58.7\%) were ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2\%) caregivers, 6 (13\%) patients and 2 (4.4\%) nurses. Among the 10 most important cases selected by each SNA network metric, transmission dynamics clustered in 17 cases, of whom 12 (70.6\%) cases were ancillary support staff.

Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the driving factors of the social rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 1,537 rumors collected from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided the sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation analysis were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics and the spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of the rumors, and the four stages of development were also divided according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network analysis method was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode network characteristics, the generation driver-rumor 2-mode network characteristics, and the spreading driver-rumor 2-mode characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results of rumor drivers indicated that panic psychology and the lag in releasing government information played an essential role in driving the generation and spread of rumors. The public's low scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors. CONCLUSION: The study revealed the mechanism of rumors.

This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of non-work-related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19.

"Duncan2021.wc","Article","Andrew J Duncan and Aaron Reeves and George J Gunn and Roger W Humphry","Quantifying changes in the British cattle movement network","Prev Vet Med",2021,"198",NA,"105524","oct","The modelling of disease spread is crucial to the farming industry and policy makers. In some of these industries, excellent data exist on animal movements, along with the networks that these movements create, and allow researchers to model spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing System is an online recording system for cattle births, deaths and between-herd movements in the United Kingdom and is an excellent resource for any researchers interested in networks or modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system. Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know how much change is occurring in a network, to help judge the merit of using historical data within a modelling context. This article uses the data to construct weighted directed monthly movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and 2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of the network has changed. Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy-makers directly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn could impact policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13 network metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as total number of nodes with movements and total movements, through to metrics to describe the network (e.g., Giant weakly and strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per node (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that there is a statistically significant effect of the period (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the values of nine of the 13 network metrics. For example median total degree decreased by 19\%. In addition to examining networks for two time periods, two updates of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement data stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates.

In combination with the significant effect of period on many of the network metrics, the modification of data between updates provides further evidence that the most recent available data should be used for network modelling.

This analysis (1) characterizes relationships that were more likely to be omitted but later recalled with prompting and (2) identifies network structural characteristics most impacted by these omissions among a sample of PWUD in rural Appalachian Kentucky, an epicenter of the opioid epidemic. METHODS: Data were collected through longitudinal assessments as part of the Social Networks Among Appalachian People (SNAP) study (2008-2017). Study participants completed interviewer-administered questionnaires that collected social network data via free-listing at baseline and six-month intervals. At visit 5, after free-listing, interviewers prompted participants with the names of previously reported alters. We used modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to identify individual- and relationship-level characteristics associated with an alter being reported only after prompting. We examined the impact of including vs. excluding relationships reported after prompting on local and global sociometric network measures (i.e., betweenness centrality, bridging, density, mean degree, transitivity, cliques, and 2-cores). RESULTS: Relationships reported only after prompting were more likely to be immediate family (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR]:1.29; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.03-1.63) and less likely to involve sex (APR:0.54; 95\% CI: 0.43-0.67). Considerable differences were observed for participant positional rankings of betweenness centrality and bridging, and differences in network density and average degree pre- and post-prompting were statistically significant.

Exchanges between actors are fundamental among stakeholders for the overall performance of a value chain and is key in the way these can respond to challenges, as epizootic threats. The present study describes how stakeholders of the swine value chain interact in the diffusion of innovative practices facing an outbreak of ASF. In seven districts, focus groups were first organized with stakeholders to identify changes and other reactions that ensued from a recent ASF outbreak in Benin. In a second step, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, following a respondent-driven sampling, to collect the contact information needed for social network analysis. The influence of actors' characteristics on their degree centrality was tested through multiple linear regression model. Regulatory requirements and available incomes facilitated practice diffusion among groups of pork butchers, traders/brokers and input suppliers.

A key question is whether the impact of social position on smoking depends on an adolescent's level of coping motives (i.e., their desire to use smoking to mitigate negative affect). METHOD: We assessed how social position predicts nicotine dependence in a longitudinal sample (N = 3,717; 44.8\% male; mean age = 13.41 years) of adolescent lifetime smokers measured between 6th and 12th grades. Using both social network analysis and multilevel modeling, we assessed this question at the between-person and within-person level, hypothesizing that within-person decreases in social position would lead to increased risk of nicotine dependence among those with high levels of coping motives. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, only interactions with the between-person measures of social position were found, with a slight negative relationship at low levels of coping motives. In addition, the main effect of coping motives was considerably stronger than that of social position at the between-person level, and social position had no significant within-person main effect on nicotine dependence risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adolescents with higher overall levels of social position among their peers may have slightly decreased risk for nicotine dependence, but only when coping motives are low. Counter to expectations, higher levels of nicotine dependence risk were not linked to fluctuations in social position.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,270

Here, we use a suite of spatial statistics and social network analysis to characterize animal movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our model utilized equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks, between-farm horse movements, and spatial landscape data from 2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and the movement of horses between farms with climate variables that foster conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a spatially explicit model that allows the effect of the climate variables on EIAV occurrence to vary through space (i.e., non-stationary). Our results identified important areas in which in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as having high 56 (11.3\%), medium 48 (9.66\%), and low 393 (79.1\%) spatial risk. The majority of the movements were between low-risk areas, altogether representing 68.68\% of all animal movements. Meanwhile, 9.48\% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20\% were within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37\% of the animals entering low-risk areas came from high-risk areas. On the other hand, 4.91\% of the animals in the high-risk areas came from low- and medium-risk areas.

We examined the ability to collaborate during the pandemic as part of a baseline evaluation of an intersectoral network of healthcare and community organizations established to improve the collective response to transgender (trans) persons who have been sexually assaulted (the trans-LINK Network). A validated social network analysis survey was sent to 119 member organizations in Ontario, Canada. Survey respondents were asked, 'Has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate with other organizations on the support of trans survivors of sexual assault?' and 'How has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate within the trans-LINK Network?'. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Seventy-eight member organizations participated in the survey (response rate = 66\%). Most organizations (79\%) indicated that the pandemic had affected their ability to collaborate with others in the network, citing most commonly, increased workload (77\%), increased demand for services (57\%), and technical and digital challenges (50\%).

METHODS: This study constructs the theoretical framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New Media, and the central government response in this pandemic. RESULTS: Findings show that the Chinese central government does not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the central government, public participation firstly creates ``participation'' with the authority of the media, forms public opinion, and then the prompt policy response from the central government.

Understanding the care and support networks of a frail individual could therefore prove useful in understanding need and designing support. This study explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of likely frailty, by describing and comparing the individuals' networks as perceived by themselves and as perceived by healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare professionals were recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls Group' programme within North-West London. Individual (i.e., one on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted to establish an individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural characteristics of the networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic analysis aided data interpretation. RESULTS: All reported care and support networks showed a high contribution level from family and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the 'frequency' and 'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare professional reported networks, the reported frequency of interaction as detailed in patient records was used to ascertain 'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the importance of the role of informal carers and friends along with healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with frailty. There was congruence in the makeup of 'patient' and 'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight the multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which could be targeted by healthcare professionals to support the care of frail individuals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Care and Support Networks; Community-Dwelling; Frailty; Older People; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,276

This study was implemented in the critical care unit, outpatient department, operation room, and ward of a small animal hospital. We conducted an observational study used for key player determination (or key node identification), then observed the selected key nodes twice with a one-month interval. Next, surface swabs of key nodes and their connecting nodes were analysed using bacterial identification, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Altogether, our results showed that veterinarians were key players in this contact network in all departments. We found two predominant similarity clusters; dendrogram results suggested E. coli isolates from different time points and places to be closely related, providing evidence of HAI circulation within and across hospital departments.

This study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017). Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their nominated discussion partners (``first-degree alters'') related to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties' interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included 558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations, parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected (1\%-3\% of possible ties observed) and most and least centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time, ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources, ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have supported more equal participation and control over intervention efforts.

This study aimed to describe the network between premises such as production herds, slaughterhouses, and traders of pig movements and identify heterogeneities in the connectivity of premises in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, using social network analysis (SNA). We used static and temporal network approaches to describe pig trade in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of node-loyalty, resilience of outgoing contact chains, and communities. Two indexes were implemented, the first one is a normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures and other index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized by a municipality to target and rank surveillance activities. Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in that 80 \% of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were found. The results also showed that premises were highly connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 \% of the paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the use of time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate potential transmission pathways and outbreak sizes.

However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic. This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities. The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective. The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le{\'o}n, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence. The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to ``track'' contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data. The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players. Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection. The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network. Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be described on the basis of aspects of similarities between students, and even leaders connecting the cohabitation sub-networks.

While individual drivers of infection are well understood, less is known about network factors, with minimal data beyond direct ties. METHODS: 2512 PWID in New Delhi, India were recruited in 2017-19 using a sociometric network design. Sampling was initiated with 10 indexes who recruited named injection partners (people who they injected with in the prior month). Each recruit then recruited their named injection partners following the same process with cross-network linkages established by biometric data. Participants responded to a survey, including information on injection venues, and provided a blood sample. Factors associated with HIV/HCV infection were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: The median age was 26; 99\% were male. Baseline HIV prevalence was 37.0\% and 46.8\% were actively infected with HCV (HCV RNA positive). The odds of prevalent HIV and active HCV infection decreased with each additional degree of separation from an infected alter (HIV AOR: 0.87; HCV AOR: 0.90) and increased among those who injected at a specific venue (HIV AOR: 1.50; HCV AOR: 1.69) independent of individual-level factors (p<0.001).

Heterosexual cycle (HET4) of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) is a social network strategy implemented in jurisdictions. The main objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate the utility of the NHBS HET cycle data for network analysis; 2) to apply statistical analysis in support of previous HIV research, as well as to develop new research results focused on demographic variables and prevention/intervention with respect to heterosexual HIV risk; and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with respect to the EHE plan. METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects. RESULTS: The results showed 3\% were tested positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI\% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model higher association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness among those tested negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV intervention in the past 12 months with those tested positive ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: The network visualization was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest behavioral supplements for DC's HIV planning activities. As part of the evaluation process our analysis helps to understand the impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on peoples' HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions use network visualizations to evaluate the efficacy in reaching hidden populations.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,294

We chose the online depression and diabetes communities on the Baidu Tieba platform as the data source. Topic modeling and theme coding were employed to analyze discussion preferences for various topic categories. Sentiment analysis was used to identify the sentiment polarity of each post and comment. The social network was used to represent the users' interaction and emotional flows to discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion patterns between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results revealed that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core users in the negative emotional contagion network. In the diabetes community, emotional contagion was less prevalent and core users in positive and negative emotional contagion networks were basically the same.

METHODS: Data were collected through baseline and 6-month assessments for the Social Networks among Appalachian People study (2008-2011). Interviewer-administered surveys collected sociodemographic and drug use behaviors (past 6 months and lifetime). Participants also listed sex, drug use, and social support partners (past 6 months). Listed names were cross-referenced with survey participants to identify relationships between study participants. The analytic sample was further restricted to include only those relationship pairs where both individuals reported a history of injection drug use at baseline (n = 244 unique individuals and 746 dyads). We fit a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model to (1) assess the relationship between peer injection cessation and individual injection cessation and (2) determine whether the strength of this association differs by relationship-level variables (i.e., relationship role, relationship type, relationship duration, frequency of interaction, residential proximity). RESULTS: Overall, those with a network member who ceased injection drug use were more likely to stop injecting over the following 6-month period (AOR=1.65). The magnitude of this association was greater for social support partners (AOR=2.95), family members (AOR=3.56), those with whom the participant interacted at least daily (AOR=2.17), and those who the participant knew longer (AOR=2.09). Further, among family members, the effect size was greater when relationships were further restricted to immediate family members (AOR=5.35). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in this rural community, closer, more supportive relationships, may be more influential for modeling injection cessation; however, relationship-types were not mutually exclusive so differences in effect size across strata may not be statistically significant. In this setting, social support through the recovery process (including cessation attempts with peers) may increase likelihood of injection cessation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Cessation; Injection drug use; Peer Influence; Rural; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,302

METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant.

Drawing on network theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on the number of shared patients among providers (ie, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured using average path length, which describes how efficiently information flows among network members; longer path length indicates greater fragmentation.

METHODS: We analyzed epidemiological and sociobehavioral data (demographics, contact tracing, and WiFi-based co-location data) alongside pathogen surveillance data (wastewater and diagnostic testing, and viral genomic sequencing of wastewater and clinical specimens) to characterize outbreak dynamics and inform policy. We applied relative risk, multiple linear regression, and social network assortativity to identify attributes or behaviors associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2. To characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we used viral sequencing, phylogenomic tools, and functional assays. FINDINGS: Athletes, particularly those on high-contact teams, had the highest risk of testing positive. On average, individuals who tested positive had more contacts and longer interaction durations than individuals who never tested positive. The distribution of contacts per individual was overdispersed, although not as overdispersed as the distribution of phylogenomic descendants.

We compared the outcome and variation of the three metrics in the experiments: infection case, death case, and death rate.

The ultimate goal of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is to minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with the famous influence maximization problem studied in the field of social network analysis, whose objective is to identify a group of influential individuals to maximize the influence spread over social networks. This study aims to establish the equivalence of the two problems and develop an effective methodology for targeted immunization through the use of influence maximization. METHODS: We present a concise formulation of the targeted immunization problem and show its equivalence to the influence maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well as the targeted immunization problem, can be solved by an optimization approach. A Benders' decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem for effective solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the optimization approach on real-world large-scale networks. Computational results show that our proposed approaches achieve more effective solutions compared to existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization and influence maximization problems and present a concise formulation for the influence maximization problem under the Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff between computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is illustrated.

Human, animal, and environmental health actors involved in both research and surveillance were considered. Semi-directed interviews and a Social Network Analysis were carried out to learn about the surveillance network structure and actors, analyze information flows, and identify communication challenges. An information system was developed to fill major gaps: users' needs and main functionalities were defined through a participatory process where actors also tested and validated the tool. Additionally, all actors shared their data, which were digitized, cataloged, and centralized, to be analyzed later. An R Shiny server was integrated into the information system, allowing an accessible and dynamic display of data showcasing all of the partners' information.

OBJECTIVES: Basic Psychological Needs Theory will be utilized to understand how sexual health communication (SHC) influences sexual health behaviors of HBC-MSM. The proposed study will advance this goal by describing characteristics of SHC embedded within social and sexual networks, and identifying the effects of SHC on sexual health behaviors among a sample of Black and Latino HBC-MSM. METHODS: This study entails cross-sectional quantitative survey design with internet-based data collection to test a theory-driven model of the effects of autonomy supportive communication on sexual health behaviors. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and internet driven sampling (ID) will be used to recruit a sample of 200 HBC-MSM. We will utilize egocentric network analysis to describe (a) the HBC-specific social and/or sexual network members who provide SHC; (b) the degree of autonomy support provided by network members, and (c) the sexual health behaviors characterizing the sample of HBC-MSM. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be performed to test associations between autonomy supportive sexual health communication (independent variable) and sexual health behaviors (outcome), with needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation as intervening mediators. DISCUSSION: Such knowledge is necessary to expand understanding of how SHC impacts sexual health behaviors for HBC-MSM. The study provides an critical perspective on sexual health behaviors and motivations as participants operate in HBC.

The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled with communities and practices where the interactions between birds are high, emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken diseases in the province. However, to set up such a system requires knowledge of the value chain and trade networks. Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted. Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be targeted for disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size and influence within their ego networks. Traders and their transport vehicles were identified as biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified three municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) and Enoch Mgijima as trade hubs where interaction between rural chickens occurs and resources can be focused. The movement of spent hens from commercial operations that are transported over long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the first study to formally describe chicken trade networks within the province and the surrounding region. Its findings provide a model for cost effective targeted surveillance in the ECP and similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also provides insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a possible contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation once the barriers to market entry are lifted.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Disease surveillance; hotspots; rural chicken; trade networks; value chain","en",NA,NA,NA,318

The aim of this study was to validate the Brief Alcohol Social Density Assessment (BASDA), an efficient measure of perceived alcohol use within a person's social network, in a sample of adult drinkers from the general community. Specifically, the convergent, criterion-related, incremental validity and internal validity were investigated by examining the BASDA in relation to other established measures of drinking motives, weekly drinking level, and severity of involvement. METHODS: Participants were 903 (56\% female) adults who reported drinking in the last year and who completed the BASDA, the Drinking Motives Questionnaire, the Daily Drinking Questionnaire, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were found between the BASDA and drinking motives, drinking quantity, and the AUDIT (rs = 0.21 to 0.51, ps < 0.001), providing support for convergent validity. There was a significantly higher BASDA score for those scoring at or above an AUDIT cutoff for hazardous drinking (p < 0.001), providing support for criterion-related validity. Finally, beyond motives and covariates, the BASDA was significantly associated with total AUDIT score ($\Delta$R(2) = 0.09, p < 0.001), indicating its additive contribution and providing support for incremental validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed excellent fit, and all items significantly loaded onto a single factor (p < 0.0001), providing evidence of internal validity. The resulting alcohol social density latent variable was significantly and robustly associated with drinks per week and AUDIT total score. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support for the BASDA as a valid and efficient measure of social network alcohol density for understanding social influences on alcohol misuse.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Alcohol; Alcohol Misuse; Motives; Social Density; Social Network Analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,320

This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6\%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally, interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may enhance the prevention of PIU.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hungary","COVID-19; internal locus of control; objective peer effects; problematic Internet use; residential college students; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,321

AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality: 0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes.

The findings are as follows: First, the inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19 patent cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation level, kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based cooperation has the widest scope, while proximity-based cooperation exists throughout these two main models of cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core position in the network, and play an important role in utilizing structural holes and bridging.

In this study, we adopted methods from social network analysis to explore pig trades in Austria. We used a dataset of daily records of swine movements covering the period 2015-2021. We analyzed the topology of the network and its structural changes over time, including seasonal and long-term variations in the pig production activities. Finally, we studied the temporal dynamics of the network community structure. Our findings show that the Austrian pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial farm density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a scale-free topology but was very sparse, suggesting a moderate impact of infectious disease outbreaks. However, two regions (Upper Austria and Styria) may present a higher structural vulnerability. The network also showed very high assortativity between holdings from the same federal state. Dynamic community detection revealed a stable behavior of the clusters.

However, most analyses focus solely on direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution of live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases. Here, we used French live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one of the largest transport companies to compare direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate how these patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614 farms were included in the study, and two directed networks were generated: the animal introduction network (exchange of live ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles). Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were scrutinized in relation to farm infection status during the epidemic. Results showed that farms were substantially more connected in the transit network than in the animal introduction network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals. We also showed that animal introduction and transit networks' statistics decreased substantially during the epidemic (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a probability of 33.3 \% that a farm exposed to the infection through either of the two live duck movement networks (i.e. that was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was reported as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within seven days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that the level of exposure of farms by these two contact patterns was low, leading only to a handful of transmission events through these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live animal movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but have been efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the French 2020-2021 epidemic. These results underpin the relevance of studying indirect contacts resulting from the movement of animals to understand their transmission potential and the importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease control strategies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Animal introduction and transit networks; Biosecurity; Disease transmission; Epidemiological modelling; Poultry; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,333

We aimed to typologize the network-level norms of sexual behaviors within the social networks of Black sexual and gender minoritized groups (SGM) assigned male at birth. Survey data were collected in Chicago, Illinois, USA, between 2018 and 2019 from Black SGM.

We used Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify network-level norms based on the proportion of alters' approval of the participant engaging in condomless sex, group sex, and use of drugs to enhance sex (i.e., injunctive norms) and alters' engagement in these behaviors (i.e., descriptive norms). We then used binomial regression analyses to examine associations between network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV vulnerability from sex. The results of our LPA indicated that our sample experienced five distinct latent profiles of network-level norms: (1) low HIV vulnerability network norm, (2) moderately high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability network norm, (4) condomless sex dominant network norm, and (5) approval of drug use during sex dominant network norm. Condomless anal sex, group sex, and using drugs to enhance sex were positively and significantly associated with higher HIV vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV vulnerability norm profiles.

Despite this disproportionate risk for HIV, there are no HIV prevention interventions that aim to decrease HIV among Latina seasonal workers. METHODS: The PROGRESO EN SALUD study compared the outcomes of two interventions adapted to include a social network component (VOICES and HEALTHY). Recruitment used a social network respondent-driven sampling design in which each seed was asked to recruit three friends, and those friends were asked to recruit three friends, for a total of twenty groups of 13 friends. We collected data at baseline, and 6 months and 12 months post intervention completion. We used generalized estimating equation models, properly adjusted for non-independent contributions of both social network interventions, to estimate the effects. Gaussian family multivariate models were calculated, addressing exchangeable working correlations, including both individual-level and cluster-level covariates in these models. RESULTS: A total of 261 Latina seasonal workers participated in either the HEALTHY or the VOICES intervention. There were significant changes over time in cognitive factors (HIV knowledge, condom use self-efficacy, and adequate knowledge of condom use), behavioral factors (condom use, female condom use, and HIV testing), and communication factors (talking with friends about HIV prevention and intention to negotiate safe sex with male partners). DISCUSSION: This study supports the literature suggesting that interventions incorporating social networks can have positive effects on HIV prevention and treatment outcomes, including sustained benefits beyond study periods.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","HIV/AIDS; Hispanic Americans; intervention development; prevention science; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,359

This paper aims to advance the research agenda of BE and PA for obesity prevention in Latin America and among Latino youth in the United States by (1) identifying environmental indicators to inform the design of interventions and policy, (2) identifying interdisciplinary methodological approaches for the study of the complex association between BE and PA, and (3) presenting case studies of PA-promoting BE programs. A group of U.S. and Latin American scientists collaboratively worked to propose innovative indicators of the BE, methodological approaches for the study of the complex association between BE and PA, and review case studies of PA-promoting BE programs in both regions. The results identified gaps in knowledge, proposed environmental indicators (e.g., landscape, street design, mobility patterns, and crime and safety), reviewed methodological approaches (social network analysis, citizen science methods), and case studies illustrating PA-promoting BE programs (i.e., play streets, active school transport, and school setting interventions). The obesity prevention among Latino and Latin American youth requires advanced research on BE and PA addressing context-specific priorities and exchanging lessons learned.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Latin American youth; Latino children and adolescents; built environment; physical activity","en",NA,NA,NA,361

Arguments based on social identity theory, however, suggest that only same-ethnic but not cross-ethnic friends are important for ERI development. Using longitudinal social network analysis, we examined peer influence of both same- and cross-ethnic friends on ERI attachment and private regard. Data were drawn from six ethnically diverse schools in Western Germany (N = 1,349; M(age) = 13.3). Our results provide empirical evidence for early adolescents' ERI being influenced by same- but less by cross-ethnic friends. Considering peers' ethnicity therefore is crucial for understanding peer influence on ERI development.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,370

We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia. To sum up, races/ethnicities not only vary in structure and timing of death but they differ in morbid processes leading to death as well.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,372
