TI  - A social network analysis of interorganisational collaboration: Efforts to 
      improve social connectedness.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged public health practitioners and clinicians 
      at multiple levels to intentionally consider the impact of social isolation on 
      health outcomes. Many community-based programmes design interventions to address 
      tangible challenges within the social determinants of health, such as asset 
      insecurity or food insecurity, to address health inequities. The growing need to 
      address social isolation within marginalised communities also requires 
      organisations to collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen 
      their own social integration within the community. The present research reports 
      on the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of community programmes within 
      three southern U.S. cities and their local collaborations to address social 
      isolation. After interviewing representatives of 46 community organisations, it 
      was found that social service organisations that also offer public health 
      services play a central role in community efforts to improve social isolation. 
      The participating organisations primarily collaborate through referrals and 
      information sharing, and report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition 
      that social services and supports play a considerable role in addressing health 
      inequities, this study provides evidence of opportunities for interorganisational 
      collaboration to promote individual and community health.

AB  - Machine learning techniques facilitate efficient analysis of complex networks, 
      and can be used to discover communities. This study aimed use such approaches to 
      raise awareness of the COVID-19. In this regard, social network analysis 
      describes the clustering and classification processes for detecting communities. 
      The background of this paper analyzed the geographical distribution of Tambaram, 
      Chennai, and its public health care units. This study assessed the spatial 
      distribution and presence of spatiotemporal clustering of public health care 
      units in different geographical settings over four months in the Tambaram zone. 
      To partition a homophily synthetic network of 100 nodes into clusters, an 
      empirical evaluation of two search strategies was conducted for all IDs 
      centrality of linkage is same. First, we analyzed the spatial information between 
      the nodes for segmenting the sparse graph of the groups. Bipartite The structure 
      of the sociograms 1-50 and 51-100 was taken into account while segmentation and 
      divide them is based on the clustering coefficient values. The result of the 
      cohesive block yielded 5.86 density values for cluster two, which received a 
      percentage of 74.2. This research objective indicates that sub-communities have 
      better access to influence, which might be leveraged to appropriately share 
      information with the public could be used in the sharing of information 
      accurately with the public.

AB  - In our Information Technology (IT) based societies, social media plays an 
      important role in communications and social networks for COVID-19. This study 
      explores social responses for COVID-19 in North America, which is the most severe 
      continent affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs social network 
      analysis for Twitter among the US, Canada, and Mexico. This study finds that the 
      3 countries show different characteristics of social networks for COVID-19. For 
      example, the Prime Minister plays the second most important role in the Canadian 
      networks, whereas the Presidents play the most significant role in them, in the 
      US, and Mexico. WHO shows a pivotal effect on social networks of COVID-19 in 
      Canada and the US, whereas it does not affect them in Mexico. Canadians are 
      interested in COVID-19 apps, the American people criticize the president and 
      administration as incompetent in terms of COVID-19, and the Mexican people search 
      for COVID-19 cases and the pandemic in Mexico. This study shows that governments 
      and disease experts should understand social networks and communications of 
      social network services, to develop effective COVID-19 policies according to the 
      characteristics of their country.

TI  - Personal Social Networks and Adiposity in Adolescents: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 542-550
LID - 10.1089/chi.2020.0343 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objective: Weight-related behaviors are determined by multiple 
      individual and contextual factors, with recent evidence implicating personal 
      social networks (PSNs). Greater understanding of these relationships could help 
      inform healthy weight promoting interventions. We conducted a feasibility study 
      among youth at risk of obesity to document process outcomes, to discern 
      relationships between PSN features and weight-related behaviors, and to generate 
      hypotheses with respect to perceived social support (SS) and sex. Methods: 
      Participants (egos) nominated up to 10 people (alters) with whom they discussed 
      important matters. Egos reported their own and each alter's age, sex, body shape, 
      lifestyle behaviors, relation, frequency of exercising with each alter, and of 
      being encouraged by each alter to exercise. We examined relationships between PSN 
      features and weight-related outcomes and explored the role of SS, using both 
      correlational and linear regression analyses. Results: There were 45 participants 
      (mean age 16.4 years) and body mass index z-score (zBMI) ranged from -1.2 to 3.9. 
      There were few missing responses to PSN items; broad variation across most items, 
      including SS scores, was reported. Correlations pointed to plausible 
      relationships implicating PSN features and lifestyle behaviors. In exploratory 
      analyses, network-based SS was positively associated with adiposity in girls and 
      negatively associated in boys, while lifestyle role modelling was not associated 
      with adiposity. Conclusions: Our findings support the feasibility of measuring 
      the PSN in youth and the potential for using social network analysis to 
      investigate social and behavioral mechanisms associated with obesity.

TI  - A Network Approach to Stroke Systems of Care.
PG  - e005526
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005526 [doi]
AB  - The landscape of stroke systems of care is evolving as patients are increasingly 
      transferred between hospitals for access to higher levels of care. This is driven 
      by time-sensitive disability-reducing interventions such as mechanical 
      thrombectomy. However, coordination and triage of patients for such treatment 
      remain a challenge worldwide, particularly given complex eligibility criteria and 
      varying time windows for treatment. Network analysis is an approach that may be 
      applied to this problem. Hospital networks interlinked by patients moved from 
      facility to facility can be studied using network modeling that respects the 
      interdependent nature of the system. This allows understanding of the central 
      hubs, the change of network structure over time, and the diffusion of 
      innovations. This topical review introduces the basic principles of network 
      science and provides an overview on the applications and potential interventions 
      in stroke systems of care.

TI  - Social Network Analysis of COVID-19 Public Discourse on Twitter: Implications for 
      Risk Communication.
PG  - 561-569
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2020.347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of social 
      network analysis to understand public discourse on Twitter around the novel 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined different network 
      properties that might affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of 
      public health messages from public health officials and health agencies. METHODS: 
      We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from 
      late January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software that 
      collects publicly available data from social media sites such as Twitter. 
      RESULTS: We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is highly 
      decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these characteristics can 
      hinder the successful dissemination of public health messages in a network. 
      Competing conversations and misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts 
      in a way that imperil public health. CONCLUSIONS: Looking at basic metrics might 
      create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on 
      social media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social 
      network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral part of 
      how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and evaluate risk

TI  - Social networks and obesity among Somali immigrants and refugees.
PG  - 238
LID - 10.1186/s12889-020-8315-7 [doi]
LID - 238
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somali immigrants and refugees to the United States are at high risk 
      for obesity and related cardiovascular risk. Social network factors influence 
      health behaviors and are important contributors to the obesity epidemic. The 
      objective of this study was to describe social networks and obesity-related 
      characteristics among adult Somali immigrants in a Minnesota city in order to 
      inform a community-based, participatory, research-derived, social network 
      intervention to decrease obesity rates. METHODS: Survey data (demographics, 
      general health measures, and sociobehavioral and network measures) and height and 
      weight measures (for calculating body mass index) were collected from adult 
      Somali immigrants by bilingual study team members at community locations. 
      Descriptive statistics were used to report the survey and biometric data. 
      Logistic regression models were used to describe the basic associations of 
      participants and network factors. Network data were analyzed to identify nodes 
      and ties, to visualize the network, and to identify potential interventionists 
      for a future social network intervention. RESULTS: Of the 646 participants, 50% 
      were overweight or affected by obesity. The network had 1703 nodes with 3583 ties 
      between nodes, and modularity was high (0.75). Compared with respondents of 
      normal weight, participants who were overweight or affected by obesity had more 
      network members who were also overweight or obese (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% CI, 
      1.11-7.56; P = .03); this was most notable for men (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 1.22-17.22; 
      P = .02) and suggestive for those 50 years or older (OR, 24.23; 95% CI, 
      1.55-377.83; P = .03). Weight loss intention among participants who were 
      overweight or affected by obesity was associated with number of family members 
      and friends trying to lose weight, enabling functional network factors (social 
      norms for weight loss, social support for healthy eating, and social cohesion), 
      and less favorable obesogenic social norms. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample 
      of Somali immigrants, distinct social networks are clustered by weight status, 
      and social contacts and functional network characteristics are related to 
      individuals' weight loss intentions. These factors should be considered in weight 
      loss interventions and programs. A social network intervention targeting weight 
      loss, within a community-based participatory research framework, is feasible in 
      this vulnerable population.

TI  - Social Network Analysis of COVID-19 Sentiments: 10 Metropolitan Cities in Italy.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137720 [doi]
LID - 7720
AB  - The pandemic spread rapidly across Italy, putting the region's health system on 
      the brink of collapse, and generating concern regarding the government's capacity 
      to respond to the needs of patients considering isolation measures. This study 
      developed a sentiment analysis using millions of Twitter data during the first 
      wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 10 metropolitan cities in Italy's (1) north: 
      Milan, Venice, Turin, Bologna; (2) central: Florence, Rome; (3) south: Naples, 
      Bari; and (4) islands: Palermo, Cagliari. Questions addressed are as follows: (1) 
      How did tweet-related sentiments change over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      and (2) How did sentiments change when lagged with policy shifts and/or specific 
      events? Findings show an assortment of differences and connections across Twitter 
      sentiments (fear, anger, and joy) based on policy measures and geographies during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can be used by policy makers to quantify the 
      satisfactory level of positive/negative acceptance of decision makers and 
      identify important topics related to COVID-19 policy measures, which can be 
      useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protective measures 
      using historical data.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and food poverty conversations: Social network analysis of 
      Twitter data.
PG  - 93-105
LID - 10.1111/nbu.12547 [doi]
AB  - This novel and mixed-method study investigated food poverty conversations at the 
      beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent national lockdown on the 
      social media platform Twitter. NodeXL Pro software was used to collect tweets 
      using the terms 'food' and 'poverty' in any order somewhere in a tweet sent on 
      selected days between April 5 and May 23, 2020. The data obtained from NodeXL Pro 
      were cleaned. Social network analysis tools were used to analyse and visualise 
      our data. Using this method, sentiment-related words (positive or negative 
      words), the top (the most mentioned) 10 hashtags, top words and top word pairs 
      were identified. The patterns of word pairs communicated in our network were 
      visualised based on each word pair's frequency. This also enabled us to carry out 
      a content analysis to create coding of the word pairs' data. A total of 81 249 
      tweets were identified that contained the terms 'food' and 'poverty'. Our 
      findings revealed that individuals' tweets overwhelmingly contained views about 
      the increase in hunger, food poverty and food insecurity due to the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Twitter users perceived that when the pandemic measures began, many 
      food-secure families were pushed into food insecurity due to a rapid rise in 
      unemployment and rising poverty due to the quarantine and stay-at-home 
      instructions in place at the time. They also addressed the sharp rise in food 
      poverty being driven by panic buying, food shortages, food affordability and 
      disruptions in food supply and food systems. Our analysis of this data suggests 
      that to mitigate food poverty or to prevent a 'hunger pandemic' for future 
      pandemic emergencies, comprehensive and longer term policy responses and economic 
      supports are needed to strengthen the resilience of food systems. However, the 
      highlighted limitations of this study must be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus carriage increases the risk of infection. We 
      used social network analysis to evaluate whether contacts have the same S. aureus 
      genotype indicating direct transmission or whether contagiousness is an indirect 
      effect of contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. METHODS: The 
      Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among 1038 high school 
      students. S. aureus carriage was determined from two nasal swab cultures and the 
      genotype was determined by spa-typing of positive throat swabs. RESULTS: S. 
      aureus carriage and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (P < 0.001). 
      The probability of carriage increased by 5% for each S. aureus positive contact. 
      Male sex was associated with a 15% lower risk of transmission compared to the 
      female sex, although the carriage prevalence was higher for men (36% vs 24%). 
      Students with medium physical activity levels, medium/high alcohol use, or normal 
      weight had a higher number of contacts and an increased risk of transmission (P < 
      0.002). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the direct social transmission of S. aureus. 
      Lifestyle factors are associated with the risk of transmission, suggesting the 
      effects of indirect social groups on S. aureus carriage, such as friends having 
      more similar environmental exposures. The male predominance in the carriage is 
      determined by sex-specific predisposing host characteristics as the social 
      transmission is less frequent in males than females. Information on social 
      networks may add to a better understanding of S. aureus epidemiology.

AB  - Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities account for a disproportionate 
      share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in US nursing homes 
      have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An 
      early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified 
      staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from 
      the Life Care Center in Kirkland, WA, to other skilled nursing facilities. The 
      full extent of staff connections between nursing homes-and the role these 
      connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is 
      currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility 
      employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via 
      shared staff and contractors using device-level geolocation data from 50 million 
      smartphones, and find that 5.1% of smartphone users who visited a nursing home 
      for at least 1 h also visited another facility during our 11-wk study period-even 
      after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of 
      connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 
      7.1 other facilities. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home 
      quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. 
      Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home's staff network connections 
      and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases.

AB  - A COVID-19 outbreak occurred among Cameron Peak Fire responders in Colorado, USA, 
      during August 2020-January 2021. The Cameron Peak Fire was the largest recorded 
      wildfire in Colorado history, lasting August-December 2020. At least 6,123 
      responders were involved, including 1,260 firefighters in 63 crews who mobilized 
      to the fire camps. A total of 79 COVID-19 cases were identified among responders, 
      and 273 close contacts were quarantined. State and local public health 
      investigated the outbreak and coordinated with wildfire management teams to 
      prevent disease spread. We performed whole-genome sequencing and applied social 
      network analysis to visualize clusters and transmission dynamics. Phylogenetic 
      analysis identified 8 lineages among sequenced specimens, implying multiple 
      introductions. Social network analysis identified spread between and within 
      crews. Strategies such as implementing symptom screening and testing of arriving 
      responders, educating responders about overlapping symptoms of smoke inhalation 
      and COVID-19, improving physical distancing of crews, and encouraging 
      vaccinations are recommended.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted research interests from all 
      fields. Phylogenetic and social network analyses based on connectivity between 
      either COVID-19 patients or geographic regions and similarity between syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences provide unique angles to answer public 
      health and pharmaco-biological questions such as relationships between various 
      SARS-CoV-2 mutants, the transmission pathways in a community and the 
      effectiveness of prevention policies. This paper serves as a systematic review of 
      current phylogenetic and social network analyses with applications in COVID-19 
      research. Challenges in current phylogenetic network analysis on SARS-CoV-2 such 
      as unreliable inferences, sampling bias and batch effects are discussed as well 
      as potential solutions. Social network analysis combined with epidemiology models 
      helps to identify key transmission characteristics and measure the effectiveness 
      of prevention and control strategies. Finally, future new directions of network 
      analysis motivated by COVID-19 data are summarized.

AB  - At present, major public health emergencies frequently occur worldwide, and it is 
      of great significance to analyze the research status and latest developments in 
      this field to improve the ability of public health emergency management in 
      various countries. This paper took 5,143 related studies from 2007 to 2020 from 
      the Web of Science as research object and used CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and other 
      software to perform co-word analysis, social network analysis, and cluster 
      analysis. The results and conclusions were as follows: (1) the related research 
      identified three periods: the exploration, growth, and outbreak period; (2) 
      chronologically: the relevant research evolved from medical and health care for 
      major diseases to emergency management and risk assessment of public health 
      emergencies and then researched the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia 
      epidemic; (3) clustering analysis of high-frequency keywords, identifying three 
      research hotspots: "disaster prevention and emergency medical services," 
      "outbreak and management of infectious diseases in Africa," and "emergency 
      management under the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic." Finally, this study combined 
      the data and literature analysis to point out possible future research 
      directions: from the research of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic to the research 
      of general major public health emergencies, thinking and remodeling of the 
      national public health emergency management system, and exploring the 
      establishment of an efficient international emergency management cooperation 
      mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to substantial public 
      discussion. Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, 
      and individuals navigate the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the 
      sentiments toward COVID-19. METHODS: This study applied machine learning methods 
      in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. 
      Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English 
      during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined 
      COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also 
      conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the 
      tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis 
      of the tweets was also conducted. RESULTS: There were a total of 14,180,603 
      likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during 
      the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis 
      classified 434,254 (48.2%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7%) 
      as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant 
      themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, 
      business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New 
      Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative 
      sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North 
      Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 
      5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive 
      to negative. These themes and sentiments can clarify the public's response to 
      COVID-19 and help officials navigate the pandemic.

TI  - What constitutes a syndemic? Methods, contexts, and framing from 2019.
PG  - 213-217
LID - 10.1097/COH.0000000000000628 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to describe what methods were 
      used for 60 articles on HIV syndemics in 2019, where they took place, what 
      syndemic clusters emerged, and why this matters. RECENT FINDINGS: Most articles 
      published in 2019 used regression analyses, and fewer used higher level modeling 
      techniques, frequencies and descriptive, longitudinal cohort study, and social 
      network analysis. Some employed ethnography, qualitative interviews, or were 
      simply reviews. Most syndemic co-factors were substance abuse, risky sexual 
      behavior, depression, intimate partner violence, stigma, sexually transmitted 
      infections, and trauma and non-communicable diseases. Half of the studies were 
      conducted in the United States and mostly in urban areas. Other contexts were 
      Canada, Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Botswana, Jamaica, 
      Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, China, Peru, and Romania. SUMMARY: Most 
      recommendations suggested that people living with HIV need interventions that 
      address other factors situated within their life, such as their mental health, 
      social stigma, experiences of trauma and intimate partner violence, and social 
      stigma and sexual risk taking. Many took an intersectoral approach and emphasized 
      the need to consider the various factors that shape experiences with HIV, from 
      sex, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity, and past trauma.

AB  - We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to assess the potential of SNA as a tool for 
      outbreak monitoring and control. We analysed contact tracing data of 1147 
      COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11-40, 742 males), 
      anonymised and made public by the Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape 
      and Gephi, were used to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of 
      nodes (cases) and edges (directed links from source to target patients). 
      Outdegree was 1-47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76%) 
      nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness. Delhi 
      was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload 
      in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four 
      (2.96%) 'super-spreaders' (outdegree ⩾ 5) caused 60% of the transmissions. 
      Real-time social network visualisation can allow healthcare administrators to 
      flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritising 
      these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimise resource 
      outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.

AB  - Urbanisation and common mental disorders (CMDs; ie, depressive, anxiety, and 
      substance use disorders) are increasing worldwide. In this Review, we discuss how 
      urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate to each other and call for a complexity 
      science approach to advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an 
      ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in 191 countries. We 
      found a positive, non-linear relationship with a higher CMD prevalence in more 
      urbanised countries, particularly for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of 
      meta-analytic studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We 
      identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social urban 
      environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs. We argue that factors 
      in the urban environment are likely to operate as a complex system and interact 
      with each other and with individual city inhabitants (including their 
      psychological and neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an 
      urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales and show feedback 
      loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour characterised by non-linearity that 
      is hard to predict over time. We present a conceptual framework for future urban 
      mental health research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by 
      discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network analyses, 
      system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling) could enable identification 
      of actionable targets for treatment and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens 
      in an urban context.

TI  - Public Opinion Manipulation on Social Media: Social Network Analysis of Twitter 
      Bots during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192416376 [doi]
LID - 16376
AB  - Social media is not only an essential platform for the dissemination of public 
      health-related information, but also an important channel for people to 
      communicate during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social bots can interfere with 
      the social media topics that humans follow. We analyzed and visualized Twitter 
      data during the prevalence of the Wuhan lab leak theory and discovered that 29% 
      of the accounts participating in the discussion were social bots. We found 
      evidence that social bots play an essential mediating role in communication 
      networks. Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the information 
      diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social 
      bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are 
      vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified 
      messages across social media. These findings show that limiting the use of social 
      bots might be an effective method to minimize the spread of conspiracy theories 
      and hate speech online.

TI  - Friendship and Consumption Networks in Adolescents and Their Relationship to 
      Stress and Cannabis Use Intention.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18073335 [doi]
LID - 3335
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is an illegal psychoactive substance that's use is 
      widespread among adolescents. During adolescence, many changes can cause stress. 
      In this phase, the group of friends becomes increasingly important, being a 
      situation of vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an escape 
      mechanism or due to peer's influence. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to 
      describe and analyze the structure of the consumption and friendship network, the 
      intention to use cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: 
      An online platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were used for data 
      collection. RESULTS: The sample consisted of adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from 
      a third-year class of compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (León, Spain). 
      Significant differences were obtained concerning consumption intention and the 
      different network metrics in both the friendship and consumption networks. 
      Subsequently, the representation of these networks was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Social Network Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a picture of the 
      context in which adolescents are located. In the consumption network, there are 
      central actors who have not yet consumed cannabis; this is a crucial moment to 
      implement prevention strategies.

TI  - COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of Twitter Data.
PG  - e19458

LID - e19458
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has led to increased 
      discussions across online platforms. These conversations have also included 
      various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory 
      has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the 
      burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of 
      fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are 
      keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an 
      understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies 
      to deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a social network 
      analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 
      27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was 
      trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed 
      through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their 
      betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster 
      using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were 
      also examined. RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest 
      network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The 
      analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was 
      actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 
      sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 
      32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general 
      tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of 
      tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, 
      although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely 
      believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the 
      most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also 
      shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the 
      conspiracy theory on Twitter. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted 
      interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to 
      reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy 
      theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile 
      of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of 
      isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms 
      provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be 
      used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context 
      of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, 
      in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.

LID - 233
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate basic epidemiological parameters. 
      Contact tracing data could also be potentially used for assessing the 
      heterogeneity of transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization 
      of individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could better inform 
      the contact tracing interventions at field levels. METHODS: Standard social 
      network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission 
      dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed 
      SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set with 
      diagnosed patients as "nodes" and their epidemiological contact as "edges" was 
      created. Directed network perspective was utilized in which directionality of 
      infection emanated from a "source patient" towards a "target patient". Network 
      measures of " degree centrality" and "betweenness centrality" were calculated to 
      identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. Components 
      analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive 
      statistics was used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used 
      to categorize influencers. RESULTS: Out-degree centrality measures identified 
      that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27% (221) patients have acted as a source of 
      infection to 40.19% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65% (12) 
      patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have collectively 
      infected 37.61% (296 of 787), secondary patients. Betweenness centrality measures 
      highlighted that 7.50% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 
      135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network 
      component analysis identified nineteen connected components comprising of 
      influential patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95% of total patients 
      (1959) and 68.74% of epidemiological contacts in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Social 
      network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in 
      measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. The 
      network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have 
      disproportionately contributed to transmission. The network measures and 
      graphical tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and 
      could help improve the contact tracing activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore how social network analysis (SNA) can be used to analyse 
      intra-hospital patient networks of individuals with a hospital acquired infection 
      (HAI) for further analysis in a geographical information systems (GIS) 
      environment. METHODS: A case and control study design was used to select 2008 
      patients. We retrieved locational data for the patients, which was then 
      translated into a network with the SNA software and then GIS software. Overall 
      metrics were calculated for the SNA based on three datasets and further analysed 
      with a GIS. RESULTS: The SNA analysis compared cases to control indicating 
      significant differences in the overall structure of the networks. A GIS visual 
      representation of these metrics was developed, showing spatial variation across 
      the example hospital floor. DISCUSSION: This study confirmed the importance that 
      intra-hospital patient networks play in the transmission of HAIs, highlighting 
      opportunities for interventions utilising these data. Due to spatial variation 
      differences, further research is necessary to confirm this is not a localised 
      phenomenon, but instead a common situation occurring within many hospitals. 
      CONCLUSION: Utilising SNA and GIS analysis in conjunction with one another 
      provided a data-rich environment in which the risk inherent in intra-hospital 
      transfer networks was quantified, visualised and interpreted for potential 
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplant rates in Ontario rose steeply in the decade prior to the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for that increase remain unclear, but the 
      inter-organizational arrangement of organ donation programs may have contributed. 
      However, there is a paucity of literature investigating these 
      inter-organizational arrangements, with a limited understanding of how 
      communication facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may 
      help to re-establish rising organ donation rates post-pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe interprofessional interactions of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators 
      (OTDCs) during organ donation cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, 
      from an organizational perspective (describing structure, context, process). 
      METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA) approach analyzing 14 organ 
      donation cases just before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social 
      network graphs depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with 
      a great part of the communication being processed through the OTDC. CONTEXT: 
      Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across cases, and health care 
      professionals perceived an atmosphere of shared vision and trust among team 
      members. PROCESS: Most networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a 
      decentralized information flow, and participants perceived decisions being 
      jointly made. The characteristic path length of cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, 
      suggesting potential for rapid information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced 
      the OTDC role of intermediator within the communication process, and hospital 
      staff perceived OTDCs as central players. Hospital staff and OTDCs reported 
      frustration with some aspects of the flow of information during the organ 
      allocation processes. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide a network map 
      of communications within organ donation cases and reinforce the importance of the 
      OTDC role. Opportunities for quality improvement within these processes are 
      identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used a Social network analysis (SNA) approach to describe 
      HIV transmission and venue affiliations among social and sexual networks of young 
      men who have sex with men (YMSM) in Houston, TX. METHODS: A total of 34 YMSM 
      indices aged 18-23 years and 23 of their network members were interviewed about 
      their social and sexual networks and venues at which they met and spent time. 
      RESULTS: Participants reported information on 220 friends (mean age = 25.3 years) 
      and 112 sexual partners (mean age = 26.3 years). Participants spent time with 
      friends and sexual partners at similar venues but relied more heavily on social 
      media and dating applications to meet sexual partners. Participants lived in zip 
      codes consistent with high concentrations of HIV positivity. Popularly frequented 
      clubs/gay bars were often 10-20 miles away, also in zip codes with high densities 
      of seropositivity. CONCLUSION: Both friendship and sexual networks are large, 
      diffuse, and not limited by geography. Participants came from areas with high 
      rates of HIV/AIDS. The venues at which participants recruited sexual partners may 
      present increased opportunities for HIV transmission. HIV prevention 
      interventions should focus on the heightened risk of unknown HIV serostatus.

AB  - RATIONALE: Mental health disorders often arise during adolescence, with 
      disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders among the most common. Given 
      the salience of peer relationships during adolescence, and research suggesting 
      that mental health disorders negatively impact social functioning, this study 
      uses novel methodology from social network analysis to uncover the social 
      processes linking disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders with 
      adolescent friendships. In particular, the study focuses on peer withdrawal, peer 
      popularity, and peer homophily in relation to both disorders. METHODS: Data come 
      from 15-year old students in four Scottish secondary schools (N = 602). Diagnoses 
      of disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders were produced using the 
      Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, and peer relationship data were 
      obtained through a friendship nomination survey. Exponential random graph models 
      were used to estimate the probability of peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and 
      peer homophily based on each disorder. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that 
      adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders were more popular than their peers 
      without disruptive behavior disorders (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). Friendship was 
      also more likely between two adolescents both with or both without disruptive 
      behavior disorders (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), demonstrating peer homophily. 
      There was no evidence that anxiety disorders were related to adolescent peer 
      relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that disruptive 
      behavior disorders may be socially rewarded (e.g., peer popularity) and socially 
      clustered (e.g., homophily), whereas anxiety disorders show no such trends. Thus, 
      intervention efforts must account for the peer social status that may be gained 
      from engaging in disruptive behavior during this developmental period. Further, 
      given that similarity in DBD status is associated with an increased likelihood of 
      friendship, adolescents are likely to be surrounded by peers who reinforce their 
      behaviors.

AB  - As HIV incidence among people who inject drugs grows in the context of an 
      escalating drug overdose epidemic in North America, investigating how network 
      structure may affect vulnerability to rapid HIV transmission is necessary for 
      preventing outbreaks. We compared the characteristics of the observed contact 
      tracing network from the 2015 outbreak in rural Indiana with 1000 networks 
      generated by an agent-based network model with approximately the same number of 
      individuals (n = 420) and ties between them (n = 913). We introduced an initial 
      HIV infection into the simulated networks and compared the subsequent epidemic 
      behavior (e.g., cumulative HIV infections over 5 years). The model was able to 
      produce networks with largely comparable characteristics and total numbers of 
      incident HIV infections. Although the model was unable to produce networks with 
      comparable cohesiveness (where the observed network had a transitivity value 35.7 
      standard deviations from the mean of the simulated networks), the structural 
      variability of the simulated networks allowed for investigation into their 
      potential facilitation of HIV transmission. These findings emphasize the need for 
      continued development of injection network simulation studies in tandem with 
      empirical data collection to further investigate how network characteristics 
      played a role in this and future outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brain Tumor Social Media (#BTSM) Twitter hashtag was founded in 
      February 2012 as a disease-specific hashtag for patients with brain tumor. 
      OBJECTIVE: To understand #BTSM's role as a patient support system, we describe 
      user descriptors, growth, interaction, and content sharing. METHODS: We analyzed 
      all tweets containing #BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur Signals platform 
      to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined user categories, tweet content, 
      and trends in use over time. We created a network plot with all publicly 
      available retweets involving #BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and 
      their connections to other users. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, 59,764 unique users 
      participated in #BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. The yearly volume of #BTSM tweets 
      increased by 264.57% from 16,394 in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with #BTSM constantly 
      trending in the top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet 
      chats. Patient advocates generated the most #BTSM tweets (33.13%), while advocacy 
      groups, caregivers, doctors, and researchers generated 7.01%, 4.63%, 3.86%, and 
      3.37%, respectively. Physician use, although still low, has increased over time. 
      The 2018 network plot of retweets including #BTSM identifies a number of key 
      stakeholders from the patient advocate, patient organization, and medical 
      researcher domains and reveals the extent of their reach to other users. 
      CONCLUSIONS: From its start in 2012, #BTSM has grown exponentially over time. We 
      believe its growth suggests its potential as a global source of brain tumor 
      information on Twitter for patients, advocates, patient organizations as well as 
      health care professionals and researchers.

AB  - Livestock movements are a common pathway for the spread infectious diseases in a 
      population. An understanding of livestock movement patterns is needed to 
      understand national transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during 
      epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that helps to describe 
      the relationships among individuals and the implications of those relationships. 
      We used SNA to describe the contact structure of livestock movements throughout 
      the contiguous U.S. from April 1(st), 2015 to March 31(st), 2016. We describe 4 
      network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminant. Livestock 
      movement data were sourced from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection 
      (ICVI) while county-level farm demographic data were from the National 
      Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described networks, nodes are 
      represented by counties and arcs by shipments between nodes; the networks were 
      weighted based on the number of shipments between nodes. For the analyses, 
      movement data were aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. 
      Measures of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification of 
      trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the study period, a total 
      of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef cattle movements accounted for 63 % 
      of all movements. At least 70 % of U.S. counties were present in each of the 
      networks, but the density of arcs was less than 2% in all networks. In the beef 
      cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly correlated (0.8) with 
      the number of beef cows per county while for the dairy cattle network a strong 
      correlation (>0.86) was found with the number of dairy cattle per km(2) at the 
      county level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large communities 
      (50 counties or more per community), and were geographically clustered except for 
      the communities in the small ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses 
      can help to understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle, 
      dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants. They may also be used in conjunction 
      with simulation modeling to evaluate spread of highly infectious disease such as 
      foot-and-mouth disease at the national level and to evaluate the application of 
      intervention strategies.

TI  - Longitudinal social network analysis of avian mycobacteriosis incidence in a 
      large population of zoo birds.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian 
      mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted to 
      determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future 
      infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of 
      infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger 
      population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 
      22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network 
      connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an 
      infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was 
      diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure 
      histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable 
      longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure 
      to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with 
      development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed 
      an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 % CI: 
      1.48-3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the 
      same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. 
      Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was 
      independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 
      1.56; 95 % CI: 1.11-2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even 
      when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never 
      had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, 
      risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased 
      the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were 
      more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and 
      those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same 
      species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease 
      risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and 
      initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social 
      network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence 
      that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show 
      low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even 
      when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on 
      the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian 
      mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.

TI  - Social network analysis to characterize women victims of violence.
PG  - 494
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-6797-y [doi]
LID - 494
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Europe, it is estimated that one third of women had experienced at 
      least one physical or sexual violence after their 15. Taking into account the 
      severe health consequences, the Emergency Department (ED), may offer an 
      opportunity to recognize when an aggression is part of the spectrum of violence. 
      This study applies Social Network analysis (SNA) to ED data in the Lazio region 
      with the objective to identify patterns of diagnoses, within all the ED accesses 
      of women experiencing an aggression, that are signals for gender-based violence 
      against women. We aim to develop a risk assessment tool for ED professionals in 
      order to strength their ability to manage victims of violence. METHODS: A cohort 
      of 124,691 women aged 15-70 with an ED visit for aggression between 2003 and 2015 
      was selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and traumas was 
      reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses and traumas, including also 
      9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA community detection algorithms and network 
      centrality measures were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly 
      associated to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the capability 
      of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of having an history of 
      violence. Model results were summed up into a risk chart. RESULTS: Among women 
      experiencing an aggression, SNA identified four communities representing specific 
      violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a central role in the 
      violence network were alcohol or substance abuse, pregnancy-related conditions 
      and psychoses. These high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 
      20% of our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and predictive 
      power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified through the SNA are 
      meaningful in the violence recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Routine ED data, analyzed 
      using SNA, can be a first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related 
      access is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women. Increasing 
      the available number of predictors, such procedures may be proven to support ED 
      staff in identifying early signs of violence to adequately support the victims 
      and mitigate the harms.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031251 [doi]
LID - 1251
AB  - (1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific production, 
      collaboration among countries, and research topics focusing on pediatric obesity. 
      (2) Methods: The papers that were included in the study were retrieved from the 
      Web of Science Core Collection from Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis 
      of several focuses, including journals of publication, subject categories, most 
      frequent author keywords, and journal impact factors, was conducted. Social 
      network analysis was used to recognize collaboration groups between countries and 
      the co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A total of 12,171 research 
      articles were published in 2036 journals classified under a variety of subject 
      areas, with pediatrics (27.7%), nutrition and dietetics (18.5%), and public 
      environmental and occupational health (18.4%) accounting for the most frequent 
      study areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity 
      (299), and BMC Public Health being the most productive journals. The main 
      challenges identified for pediatric obesity include general topics such as 
      physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as other more specific 
      challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, eating behavior, and 
      cardiovascular diseases. (4) Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number 
      of published articles of 59.8%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the 
      topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There has been 
      significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries across five 
      continents being involved. The results of the thematic analysis reveal the 
      importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics along with specialized health 
      terms and terms related to public health.

PG  - e0222434

LID - e0222434
AB  - Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically 
      developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of green 
      infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often 
      require capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or regional-scale 
      organization. In many cities, transitions toward green stormwater infrastructure 
      have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of 
      organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that 
      is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, 
      and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. 
      Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development 
      and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance 
      networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize 
      informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To 
      address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) 
      survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management 
      professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on 
      individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the 
      impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. 
      Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and 
      individual position within the network-specifically, betweenness centrality and 
      openness-defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance 
      network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more 
      likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not 
      men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization 
      and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal 
      environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ 
      substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. 
      This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with 
      complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage 
      excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and

AB  - COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public 
      conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 
      million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter 
      users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to 
      identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction 
      over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify several stable 
      clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups 
      mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political 
      actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate 
      attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the 
      time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both 
      national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of 
      country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the 
      debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but 
      experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the 
      emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification 
      and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from 
      international health organizations or scientific authorities to directly reach a 
      broad audience through Twitter for prolonged time. These results may have 
      implications for information dissemination along the unfolding of long-term 
      events like epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores how social networks for coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) are differentiated by regions. METHODS: This study employs a social 
      network analysis for Twitter in New York and California. RESULTS: National key 
      players play an important role in New York, whereas regional key players exert a 
      significant impact on California. Some key players, such as the US President, 
      play an essential role in both New York and California. Hispanic key players play 
      a crucial role in California. Each group is more likely to show communication 
      networks within groups in New York, whereas it is more apt to exhibit 
      communication networks across groups in California. Government players play a 
      different role in social networks according to regions. CONCLUSIONS: Governments 
      should understand how social networks for COVID-19 are differentiated by regions 
      to control the ongoing pandemic effectively.

LID - 3742
AB  - Long COVID is a condition distinguished by long-term sequelae that occur or 
      persist after the convalescence period of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      more and more people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced long COVID, 
      which attracted the attention of researchers. This study aims to assess the 
      pattern of long COVID research literature, analyze the research topics, and 
      provide insights on long COVID. In this study, we extracted 784 publications from 
      Scopus in the field of long COVID. According to bibliometric analysis, it is 
      found that: developed countries in Europe and America were in leading positions 
      in terms of paper productivity and citations. The International Journal of 
      Environmental Research and Public Health and the Journal of Clinical Medicine 
      were leading journals in the perspective of publications count, and Nature 
      Medicine had the highest number of citations. Author Greenhalgh T has the highest 
      number of papers and citations. The main research topics were: pathophysiology, 
      symptoms, treatment, and epidemiology. The causes of long COVID may be related to 
      organ injury, inflammation, maladaptation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
      (ACE2) pathway, and mental factors. The symptoms are varied, including physical 
      and psychological symptoms. Treatment options vary from person to person. Most 
      patients developed at least one long-term symptom. Finally, we presented some 
      possible research opportunities.

TI  - Using social network analysis to examine alcohol use among adults: A systematic 
      review.
PG  - e0221360

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use and abuse constitute a major public health problem and 
      identifying their determinants is a priority. Social network analysis can 
      indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health 
      behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to 
      examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, 
      but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The 
      current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network 
      analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking 
      behaviors in adults. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of 
      retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently 
      screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 
      articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were 
      judged eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among young 
      adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent 
      networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included 
      studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically 
      significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol 
      consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were 
      associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION: In 
      young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with 
      whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol 
      consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know 
      very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age 
      groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks appear to 
      play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young adulthood, interventions that 
      utilize social networks to help reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be 
      considered.

AB  - Exposure to the self-harm behaviour of others plays a role in individuals' own 
      self-harm thoughts and behaviours, but there has been little consideration of the 
      broader range of mediums through which exposure to self-harm related content may 
      occur. N = 477 participants completed an online study, including questions 
      regarding lifetime history of self-harm thoughts and behaviours and the frequency 
      with which they had been exposed to self-harm via various mediums. Gaussian 
      Markov random field network models were estimated using graphical LASSO and 
      extended Bayesian information criterion. Bootstrapping revealed that exposure 
      mediums with a direct connection to self-harm thoughts and behaviours were the 
      internet (rrp = .34, 95% CI [.26, .42]) and in-passing 'miscellaneous' exposure 
      (rrp = .14, 95% CI [.00, .23]). However, stability of the network centrality was 
      low (expected influence stability = 0.52). The node with the greatest increase in 
      expected influence within the network was miscellaneous "in-passing" exposure. 
      In-passing exposure is an understudied exposure medium. Our results may suggest 
      new types of exposure mediums for future research. Data were cross-sectional, so 
      temporal relationships between exposure and behaviour could not be determined. 
      Low stability of the networks suggests that future similar studies would benefit 
      from larger sample sizes.

TI  - COVID-19 and the "Film Your Hospital" Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis 
      of Twitter Data.
PG  - e22374
LID - 10.2196/22374 [doi]
LID - e22374
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy theories have 
      emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that 
      certain hospitals are "empty." Research has shown that accepting conspiracy 
      theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice 
      about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the 
      possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an 
      understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory 
      on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, 
      the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as 
      evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the 
      network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a 
      conspiracy theory in the future. METHODS: Twitter data related to the 
      #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network 
      analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 
      22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify 
      accounts with a higher probability of being bots. RESULTS: The most important 
      drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most 
      influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the 
      information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a 
      verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on 
      the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted 
      accounts within the network. CONCLUSIONS: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy 
      theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing 
      misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label 
      or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could 
      enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content.

TI  - A social network analysis model approach to understand tuberculosis transmission 
      in remote rural Madagascar.
PG  - 1511
LID - 10.1186/s12889-023-16425-w [doi]
LID - 1511
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality surveillance data used to build tuberculosis (TB) 
      transmission models are frequently unavailable and may overlook community 
      intrinsic dynamics that impact TB transmission. Social network analysis (SNA) 
      generates data on hyperlocal social-demographic structures that contribute to 
      disease transmission. METHODS: We collected social contact data in five villages 
      and built SNA-informed village-specific stochastic TB transmission models in 
      remote Madagascar. A name-generator approach was used to elicit individual 
      contact networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by 
      snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were aggregated into 
      village-level networks. Network- and individual-level characteristics determining 
      contact formation and structure were identified by fitting an exponential random 
      graph model (ERGM), which formed the basis of the contact structure and model 
      dynamics. Models were calibrated and used to evaluate WHO-recommended 
      interventions and community resiliency to foreign TB introduction. RESULTS: 
      Inter- and intra-village SNA showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with 
      transitivity (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43. Active case 
      finding and treatment yielded 67%-79% reduction in active TB disease prevalence 
      and a 75% reduction in TB mortality in all village networks. Following 
      hypothetical TB elimination and without specific interventions, networks A and B 
      showed resilience to both active and latent TB reintroduction, while Network C, 
      the village network with the highest transitivity, lacked resiliency to 
      reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence of 2% and a TB mortality rate of 
      7.3% after introduction of one new contagious infection post hypothetical 
      elimination. CONCLUSION: In remote Madagascar, SNA-informed models suggest that 
      WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease (active TB) prevalence and 
      mortality while TB infection (latent TB) burden remains high. Communities' 
      resiliency to TB introduction decreases as their interconnectivity increases. 
      "Top down" population level TB models would most likely miss this difference 
      between small communities. SNA bridges large-scale population-based and hyper 
      focused community-level TB modeling.

TI  - Social Network Analysis on the Mobility of Three Vulnerable Population Subgroups: 
      Domestic Workers, Flight Crews, and Sailors during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong 
      Kong.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137565 [doi]
LID - 7565
AB  - BACKGROUND: Domestic workers, flight crews, and sailors are three vulnerable 
      population subgroups who were required to travel due to occupational demand in 
      Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      explore the social networks among three vulnerable population subgroups and 
      capture temporal changes in their probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via 
      mobility. METHODS: We included 652 COVID-19 cases and utilized Exponential Random 
      Graph Models to build six social networks: one for the cross-sectional cohort, 
      and five for the temporal wave cohorts, respectively. Vertices were the three 
      vulnerable population subgroups. Edges were shared scenarios where vertices were 
      exposed to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The probability of being exposed to a COVID-19 
      case in Hong Kong among the three vulnerable population subgroups increased from 
      3.38% in early 2020 to 5.78% in early 2022. While domestic workers were less 
      mobile intercontinentally compared to flight crews and sailors, domestic workers 
      were 1.81-times in general more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Vulnerable populations with similar ages and occupations, especially younger 
      domestic workers and flight crew members, were more likely to be exposed to 
      SARS-CoV-2. Social network analysis can be used to provide critical information 
      on the health risks of infectious diseases to vulnerable populations.

TI  - Contact Tracing Research: A Literature Review Based on Scientific Collaboration 
      Network.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159311 [doi]
LID - 9311
AB  - Contact tracing is a monitoring process including contact identification, 
      listing, and follow-up, which is a key to slowing down pandemics of infectious 
      diseases, such as COVID-19. In this study, we use the scientific collaboration 
      network technique to explore the evolving history and scientific collaboration 
      patterns of contact tracing. It is observed that the number of articles on the 
      subject remained at a low level before 2020, probably because the practical 
      significance of the contact tracing model was not widely accepted by the academic 
      community. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented research boom to 
      contact tracing, as evidenced by the explosion of the literature after 2020. 
      Tuberculosis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases were common types of 
      diseases studied in contact tracing before 2020. In contrast, research on contact 
      tracing regarding COVID-19 occupies a significantly large proportion after 2000. 
      It is also found from the collaboration networks that academic teams in the field 
      tend to conduct independent research, rather than cross-team collaboration, which 
      is not conducive to knowledge dissemination and information flow.

TI  - Application of network analysis and cluster analysis for better prevention and 
      control of swine diseases in Argentina.
PG  - e0234489
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0234489 [doi]
LID - e0234489
AB  - RATIONALE/BACKGROUND: Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the porcine 
      sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and represents a significant 
      economic sector. In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of 
      swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually 
      eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in 
      assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also 
      for other diseases at risk of emergence. METHODS: Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 
      were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which 
      control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective 
      interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network 
      as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important 
      nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an 
      attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA 
      metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical 
      clustering. RESULTS: The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a 
      total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units 
      participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of 
      shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. 
      Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe 
      concentrating 61% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved 
      in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher 
      betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based 
      on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. 
      small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single 
      outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION: Characterizing the 
      network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine 
      shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more 
      cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where 
      efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be 
      used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in 
      assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate 
      endemic ones.

TI  - Investigating COVID-19 transmission in a tertiary hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam 
      using social network analysis.
PG  - 981-989
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13822 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak in a major referral hospital in 
      Hanoi, Vietnam led to 7664 patients and staff being sent into lockdown for 
      2 weeks, and more than 52,200 persons across 49 provinces being quarantined. We 
      assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest hospital 
      outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA). METHODS: We constructed 
      a directed relational network and calculated network metrics for 'degree', 
      'betweenness', 'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand 
      individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network components and 
      modularity to identify sub-network structures with disproportionately big 
      effects. RESULTS: We detected 68 connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 
      27 (58.7%) were ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2%) caregivers, 6 (13%) patients 
      and 2 (4.4%) nurses. Among the 10 most important cases selected by each SNA 
      network metric, transmission dynamics clustered in 17 cases, of whom 12 (70.6%) 
      cases were ancillary support staff. Ancillary support staff also constituted 
      71.1% of cases in the dominant sub-network and 68.8% of cases in the three 
      largest sub-communities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified non-clinical ancillary 
      support staff, who are responsible for room service and food distribution in 
      hospital wards in Vietnam, as a group with disproportionally big impacts on 
      transmission dynamics during this outbreak. Our findings call for a holistic 
      approach to nosocomial outbreak prevention and response that includes both 
      clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. Our work also shows the potential of 
      SNA as a complementary outbreak investigation method to better understand 
      infection patterns in hospitals and similar settings.

TI  - Sexual Partner Referral for HIV Testing Through Social Networking Platforms: 
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e32156
LID - 10.2196/32156 [doi]
LID - e32156
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) who undergo voluntary HIV counseling 
      and testing (VCT) often report condomless anal sexual intercourse, having many 
      sexual partners, and being exposed to risky sexual networks. Limited research has 
      discussed the application of motivational interviewing and convenience referral 
      platforms to facilitate the referral of sexual partners for HIV testing among 
      MSM. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of VCT referral by 
      sexual partners through social networking platforms and the test results after 
      elicited interviews with MSM; compare the characteristics and risk behaviors 
      among MSM tested without referral, index subjects, and referred sexual partners; 
      and explore unknown sexual affiliations through visualizing and quantifying the 
      social network graph. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Purposeful 
      sampling was used to recruit index subjects from a community HIV screening 
      station frequented by MSM in Taipei City on Friday and Saturday nights. 
      Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit sexual partners. Partner-elicited 
      interviews were conducted by trained staff before VCT to motivate MSM to become 
      index subjects and refer sexual partners via the Line app, or to disclose the 
      accounts and profiles of sexual partners on relevant social networking platforms. 
      Referred sexual partners received rapid HIV testing, and the recruitment process 
      was repeated until leads were exhausted. RESULTS: After the interviews, 28.2% 
      (75/266) of MSM were successfully persuaded to become index subjects in the first 
      wave, referring 127 sexual partners via the Line app for rapid HIV testing and 
      disclosing 40 sexual partners. The index subjects and tested sexual partners had 
      more sexual partners (F(2)=3.83, P=.02), more frequent anal intercourse 
      (F(2)=10.10, P<.001), and higher percentages of those who had not previously 
      received HIV testing (χ(2)(1)=6.1, P=.047) compared with MSM tested without 
      referrals. The new HIV-seropositivity rate among tested sexual partners was 2.4%, 
      which was higher than the rate in the other 2 groups. The social network analysis 
      revealed the following 4 types of sexual affiliation: chain, Y, star, and 
      complicated. Among the HIV-negative sexual partners, 26.9% (43/160) had sexual 
      affiliations with HIV-positive nodes, and 40% (10/25) were untested sexual 
      partners with a direct sexual affiliation with an HIV-positive node. Four 
      transmission bridges were found in the network graph. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Partner-elicited interviews can effectively promote referral for HIV testing and 
      case identification via Line, and can clarify unknown sexual affiliations of MSM 
      to facilitate the development of a tailored prevention program. Social network 
      analysis is needed for an insightful understanding of the different network 
      structures.

TI  - Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults: Evidence 
      From the ELSI-Brazil Study.

LID - S1064-7481(23)00260-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jagp.2023.03.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between social isolation and cognitive performance 
      has been less investigated in low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC) and the 
      presence of depression as a moderator on this association has not been examined. 
      The authors examined the associations of social isolation and perceived 
      loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of 
      Aging. METHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated 
      by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social 
      support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which 
      considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Linear and 
      logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. 
      The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation 
      and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. RESULTS: 
      Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 ± 9.2 years), higher levels of social 
      connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 
      95%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition 
      (B = -0.26, 95%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interactions of depressive symptoms with 
      social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on 
      global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social 
      isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. 
      CONCLUSION: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were 
      associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms 
      decrease the strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are 
      important to assess the direction of the association between social isolation and 
      cognitive performance.

TI  - Peer-reported bullying, rejection and hallucinatory experiences in childhood.
PG  - 503-512
LID - 10.1111/acps.13282 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur commonly in 
      children and have been related to bullying victimization. However, whether 
      bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are related to 
      hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer 
      nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration and (ii) social 
      positions within peer networks were associated with future hallucinatory 
      experiences. METHODS: This prospective study was embedded in the population-based 
      Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance 
      were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a social 
      network analysis, we estimated social positions within peer rejection and 
      acceptance networks. Bullying victimization was assessed using self-reports. 
      Self-reported hallucinatory experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses 
      were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Higher levels of bullying 
      perpetration were prospectively associated with an increased burden of 
      hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 
      50% higher, and bully-victims had a 89% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory 
      experiences three years later than children who were not involved in bullying 
      (OR(bully) = 1.50, 95% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; OR(bully-victim) = 1.89, 95% CI 
      1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks, but 
      not peer acceptance networks, were associated with an increased risk for 
      hallucinatory experiences (OR(peer rejection) = 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.44, 
      p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Using peer reports, we observed that 
      bullies and socially rejected children have a higher likelihood to report 
      hallucinatory experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a 
      victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable for 
      psychotic experiences.

TI  - Collaborative health service planning: A stakeholder analysis with social network 
      analysis to develop a community pharmacy service.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stakeholder participation optimizes health planning, fostering the 
      acceptability and integration of new health services. Collaborative approaches 
      may help overcome existing challenges in the development, implementation and 
      evaluation of community pharmacy services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the 
      foundation for building collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care. 
      OBJECTIVES: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a collaborative 
      initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in 
      Andalucía (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders, differentiate/categorize 
      them, and analyze stakeholder relationships. METHOD: Stakeholders were identified 
      using the snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders and 
      analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire 
      was sent to 186 stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, 
      interest and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity 
      to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5) concerns; (6) 
      whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they 
      had with other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive qualitative 
      content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis and social network analysis. 
      RESULTS: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6%) participated. The 
      identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or 
      collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders were considered 
      critical to the intended initiative. Most participant stakeholders supported the 
      initiative and were willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public 
      health and science were the main driving interests. A collaboration network 
      existed between the 96 stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the 
      magnitude of the social system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at 
      preventing cardiovascular disease. A large array of stakeholders was identified 
      and analyzed, and a group of critical stakeholders selected. Stakeholder 
      characteristics such as attitude toward the initiative, potential contribution, 
      desire for involvement, and the existing collaboration network, provided 
      complementary information that was helpful for planning the process and 
      stakeholder engagement.

TI  - Using Social Network Analysis to Identify Spatiotemporal Spread Patterns of 
      COVID-19 around the World: Online Dashboard Development.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18052461 [doi]
LID - 2461
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely around the world. Many mathematical 
      models have been proposed to investigate the inflection point (IP) and the spread 
      pattern of COVID-19. However, no researchers have applied social network analysis 
      (SNA) to cluster their characteristics. We aimed to illustrate the use of SNA to 
      identify the spread clusters of COVID-19. Cumulative numbers of infected cases 
      (CNICs) in countries/regions were downloaded from GitHub. The CNIC patterns were 
      extracted from SNA based on CNICs between countries/regions. The item response 
      model (IRT) was applied to create a general predictive model for each 
      country/region. The IP days were obtained from the IRT model. The location 
      parameters in continents, China, and the United States were compared. The results 
      showed that (1) three clusters (255, n = 51, 130, and 74 in patterns from Eastern 
      Asia and Europe to America) were separated using SNA, (2) China had a shorter 
      mean IP and smaller mean location parameter than other counterparts, and (3) an 
      online dashboard was used to display the clusters along with IP days for each 
      country/region. Spatiotemporal spread patterns can be clustered using SNA and 
      correlation coefficients (CCs). A dashboard with spread clusters and IP days is 
      recommended to epidemiologists and researchers and is not limited to the COVID-19 
      pandemic.

TI  - New Insights Into the Social Rumor Characteristics During the COVID-19 Pandemic 
      in China.
PG  - 864955
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.864955 [doi]
LID - 864955
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, several social 
      rumors in the form of false news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures had ever 
      been shared and spread among the general public at an alarming rate, causing 
      public panic and increasing the complexity and difficulty of social management. 
      Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the driving factors 
      of the social rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 
      1,537 rumors collected from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first 
      divided the sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all 
      kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation analysis were 
      adopted to study the time evolution characteristics and the spatial and temporal 
      correlation characteristics of the rumors, and the four stages of development 
      were also divided according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key 
      driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network analysis method 
      was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode network characteristics, the 
      generation driver-rumor 2-mode network characteristics, and the spreading 
      driver-rumor 2-mode characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the 
      number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as the outbreak was 
      brought under control, which proved the importance of epidemic prevention and 
      control to maintain social stability. Combining the number and risk perception 
      levels of the four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating 
      Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results of rumor drivers 
      indicated that panic psychology and the lag in releasing government information 
      played an essential role in driving the generation and spread of rumors. The 
      public's low scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing 
      rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors. CONCLUSION: The study 
      revealed the mechanism of rumors. In addition, studies involving rumors on 
      different emergencies and social platforms are warranted to enrich the findings.

TI  - Integrated Infodemic Surveillance System: The Case of COVID-19 in South Korea.
PG  - 1036-1040
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210342 [doi]
AB  - This study merges multiple COVID-19 data sources from news articles and social 
      media to propose an integrated infodemic surveillance system (IISS) that 
      implements infodemiology for a well-tailored epidemic management policy. IISS is 
      an à-la-carte infodemic surveillance solution that enables users to gauge the 
      epidemic related consensus, which compiles epidemic-related data from multiple 
      sources and equipped with various methodological toolkits - topic modeling, 
      Word2Vec, and social network analysis. IISS can provide reliable empirical 
      evidence for proper policymaking. We demonstrate the heuristic utilities of IISS 
      using empirical data from the first wave of COVID-19 in South Korea. Measuring 
      discourse congruence allows us to gauge the distance between the discourse corpus 
      from different sources, which can highlight consensus and conflicts in epidemic 
      discourse. Furthermore, IISS detects discrepancies between social concerns and 
      main actors.

TI  - Health equity considerations in COVID-19: geospatial network analysis of the 
      COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant population in Singapore.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taaa159 [doi]
LID - taaa159
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-wage dormitory-dwelling migrant workers in Singapore were 
      disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. 
      This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory 
      settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known 
      about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The 
      study examined the networks of non-work-related activities among migrant workers 
      to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic 
      preparedness. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant 
      workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, 
      physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables and mobility 
      patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from 
      dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks 
      examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas 
      with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with 
      the density of dormitory, social ties and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in 
      the city centre was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery 
      shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly for social 
      gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of 
      centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Social and 
      geospatial networks of migrant workers should be considered in the implementation 
      of lockdown exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living conditions 
      and monitoring systems. Essential services, like remittance and grocery shopping 
      at affordable prices, need to be provided near to dormitories to minimize excess 
      gatherings.

AB  - The modelling of disease spread is crucial to the farming industry and policy 
      makers. In some of these industries, excellent data exist on animal movements, 
      along with the networks that these movements create, and allow researchers to 
      model spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing System is 
      an online recording system for cattle births, deaths and between-herd movements 
      in the United Kingdom and is an excellent resource for any researchers interested 
      in networks or modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system. 
      Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know how much change is 
      occurring in a network, to help judge the merit of using historical data within a 
      modelling context. This article uses the data to construct weighted directed 
      monthly movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and 
      2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of the network has 
      changed. Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy-makers 
      directly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn 
      could impact policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13 network 
      metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as total number of nodes 
      with movements and total movements, through to metrics to describe the network 
      (e.g., Giant weakly and strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per 
      node (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that there is a 
      statistically significant effect of the period (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the 
      values of nine of the 13 network metrics. For example median total degree 
      decreased by 19%. In addition to examining networks for two time periods, two 
      updates of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement data 
      stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates. Examination of these 
      updates shows that there are small decreases in problem movements (such as 
      animals leaving slaughterhouses) and therefore evidence of historical data being 
      improved between updates. In combination with the significant effect of period on 
      many of the network metrics, the modification of data between updates provides 
      further evidence that the most recent available data should be used for network 
      modelling. This will ensure that the most representative descriptions of the 
      network are available to provide accurate modelling results to best inform policy 
      makers.

TI  - National Identity Development and Friendship Network Dynamics among Immigrant and 
      Non-Immigrant Youth.
PG  - 706-723

AB  - The development of peer relationships and of one's identity are key developmental 
      proficiencies during adolescence. Understanding how immigrant and non-immigrant 
      adolescents are developing a sense of their national identity and the role that 
      this plays in how they select their friends and are influenced by their friends 
      is essential for developing a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent 
      development in context. The current study used longitudinal social network 
      analysis to examine the interplay of national identity development and friendship 
      network dynamics among immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents in Greece 
      (N = 1252; 46% female). All youth with higher national identity resolution (i.e., 
      youth's sense of clarity regarding their identity as a member of Greek society) 
      in Grade 8 were more often nominated as a friend in Grade 9. During the 
      transition from 8th to 9th grade, all youth became more similar to their 
      nominated friends in terms of their Greek national identity exploration (i.e., 
      degree to which they had engaged in activities to learn more about Greek 
      society). During the transition from 7th to 8th grade, there was significant 
      variability in peer selection on national identity exploration and resolution 
      between immigrant and non-immigrant youth. Specifically, immigrant youth 
      demonstrated selection effects consistent with notions of homophily, such that 
      they were more likely to nominate peers in 8th grade whose levels of national 
      identity exploration and resolution were similar to their own when in 7th grade. 
      In contrast, non-immigrant youth preferred peers in 8th grade with low levels of 
      national identity exploration (regardless of their own levels of exploration in 
      7th grade) and peers whose levels of national identity resolution in 8th grade 
      were different from their own in 7th grade (e.g., non-immigrant youth who 
      reported high national identity resolution in 7th grade were more likely to 
      nominate peers who had low national identity resolution in 8th grade). There were 
      no differences by immigrant status in peer influence, suggesting that the 
      significant peer influence effects that emerged during the transition from 8th to 
      9th grade in which youth became more similar to their friends in national 
      identity exploration may reflect a universal process. These results chart new 
      directions in understanding contemporary youth development in context by showing 
      that adolescents develop their national identity and friendships in tandem and 
      that certain aspects of this process may vary by immigrant status.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This review aimed to elucidate the significance of information 
      collaboration in the prevention and control of public health emergencies, and its 
      evolutionary pathway guided by the theory of complex adaptive systems. METHODS: 
      The study employed time-slicing techniques and social network analysis to 
      translate the dynamic evolution of information collaboration into a stage-based 
      static representation. Data were collected from January to April 2020, focusing 
      on the COVID-19 pandemic. Python was used to amass data from diverse sources 
      including government portals, public commentary, social organizations, market 
      updates, and healthcare institutions. Post data collection, the structures, 
      collaboration objectives, and participating entities within each time slice were 
      explored using social network analysis. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the 
      law of evolution for information collaboration in public health emergencies 
      primarily starts with small-scale collaboration, grows to full-scale in the 
      middle phase, and then reverts to small-scale in the final phase. The network's 
      complexity increases initially and then gradually decreases, mirroring changes in 
      collaboration tasks, objectives, and strategies. DISCUSSION: The dynamic pattern 
      of information collaboration highlighted in this study offers valuable insights 
      for enhancing emergency management capabilities. Recognizing the evolving nature 
      of information collaboration can significantly improve information processing 
      efficiency during public health crises.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has revealed under-reporting of personal network 
      members (i.e., alters) in studies involving people who use drugs (PWUD). This 
      analysis (1) characterizes relationships that were more likely to be omitted but 
      later recalled with prompting and (2) identifies network structural 
      characteristics most impacted by these omissions among a sample of PWUD in rural 
      Appalachian Kentucky, an epicenter of the opioid epidemic. METHODS: Data were 
      collected through longitudinal assessments as part of the Social Networks Among 
      Appalachian People (SNAP) study (2008-2017). Study participants completed 
      interviewer-administered questionnaires that collected social network data via 
      free-listing at baseline and six-month intervals. At visit 5, after free-listing, 
      interviewers prompted participants with the names of previously reported alters. 
      We used modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to 
      identify individual- and relationship-level characteristics associated with an 
      alter being reported only after prompting. We examined the impact of including 
      vs. excluding relationships reported after prompting on local and global 
      sociometric network measures (i.e., betweenness centrality, bridging, density, 
      mean degree, transitivity, cliques, and 2-cores). RESULTS: Relationships reported 
      only after prompting were more likely to be immediate family (Adjusted Prevalence 
      Ratio [APR]:1.29; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.03-1.63) and less likely to 
      involve sex (APR:0.54; 95% CI: 0.43-0.67). Considerable differences were observed 
      for participant positional rankings of betweenness centrality and bridging, and 
      differences in network density and average degree pre- and post-prompting were 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal network studies that aim to 
      assess transmission dynamics, information diffusion, or peer influence should 
      consider the effects of omitted relationships.

AB  - Animal epizootics show widely destructive effect on livestock value chains in sub 
      Saharan Africa, pushing many smallholders into poverty and discouraging 
      investments. Hence, African swine fever (ASF) has been playing a deeply 
      depressing role on swine value chain of Benin since its first occurrence in the 
      country in 1997. Exchanges between actors are fundamental among stakeholders for 
      the overall performance of a value chain and is key in the way these can respond 
      to challenges, as epizootic threats. The present study describes how stakeholders 
      of the swine value chain interact in the diffusion of innovative practices facing 
      an outbreak of ASF. In seven districts, focus groups were first organized with 
      stakeholders to identify changes and other reactions that ensued from a recent 
      ASF outbreak in Benin. In a second step, individual semi-structured interviews 
      were conducted, following a respondent-driven sampling, to collect the contact 
      information needed for social network analysis. The influence of actors' 
      characteristics on their degree centrality was tested through multiple linear 
      regression model. Regulatory requirements and available incomes facilitated 
      practice diffusion among groups of pork butchers, traders/brokers and input 
      suppliers. Stockbreeders displayed passivity in the diffusion of practices 
      whereas they should have the forefront role in addressing the challenge of ASF. 
      Nevertheless, their significant interest in capacity reinforcement, associations, 
      exchange visits and professionalization may lead them to increase their 
      involvement in a joint control of the disease.

TI  - The Role of Social Position Within Peer Groups in Distress-Motivated Smoking 
      Among Adolescents.
PG  - 420-429
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between smoking and adolescents' peer relationships 
      is complex, with studies showing increased risk of smoking for adolescents of 
      both very high and very low social position. A key question is whether the impact 
      of social position on smoking depends on an adolescent's level of coping motives 
      (i.e., their desire to use smoking to mitigate negative affect). METHOD: We 
      assessed how social position predicts nicotine dependence in a longitudinal 
      sample (N = 3,717; 44.8% male; mean age = 13.41 years) of adolescent lifetime 
      smokers measured between 6th and 12th grades. Using both social network analysis 
      and multilevel modeling, we assessed this question at the between-person and 
      within-person level, hypothesizing that within-person decreases in social 
      position would lead to increased risk of nicotine dependence among those with 
      high levels of coping motives. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, only 
      interactions with the between-person measures of social position were found, with 
      a slight negative relationship at low levels of coping motives. In addition, the 
      main effect of coping motives was considerably stronger than that of social 
      position at the between-person level, and social position had no significant 
      within-person main effect on nicotine dependence risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that adolescents with higher overall levels of social position among 
      their peers may have slightly decreased risk for nicotine dependence, but only 
      when coping motives are low. Counter to expectations, higher levels of nicotine 
      dependence risk were not linked to fluctuations in social position.

TI  - Coupling spatial statistics with social network analysis to estimate distinct 
      risk areas of disease circulation to improve risk-based surveillance.
PG  - e2757-e2768
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14627 [doi]
AB  - Most animal disease surveillance systems concentrate efforts in blocking 
      transmission pathways and tracing back infected contacts while not considering 
      the risk of transporting animals into areas with elevated disease risk. Here, we 
      use a suite of spatial statistics and social network analysis to characterize 
      animal movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease 
      circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our model utilized 
      equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks, between-farm horse movements, 
      and spatial landscape data from 2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and 
      the movement of horses between farms with climate variables that foster 
      conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a spatially 
      explicit model that allows the effect of the climate variables on EIAV occurrence 
      to vary through space (i.e., non-stationary). Our results identified important 
      areas in which in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections 
      and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as having high 56 
      (11.3%), medium 48 (9.66%), and low 393 (79.1%) spatial risk. The majority of the 
      movements were between low-risk areas, altogether representing 68.68% of all 
      animal movements. Meanwhile, 9.48% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20% were 
      within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37% of the animals entering low-risk areas came 
      from high-risk areas. On the other hand, 4.91% of the animals in the high-risk 
      areas came from low- and medium-risk areas. Our results demonstrate that animal 
      movements and spatial risk mapping could be used to make informed decisions 
      before issuing animal movement permits, thus potentially reducing the chances of 
      reintroducing infection into areas of low risk.

AB  - Collaboration across sectors is critical to address complex health problems, 
      particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the ability to 
      collaborate during the pandemic as part of a baseline evaluation of an 
      intersectoral network of healthcare and community organizations established to 
      improve the collective response to transgender (trans) persons who have been 
      sexually assaulted (the trans-LINK Network). A validated social network analysis 
      survey was sent to 119 member organizations in Ontario, Canada. Survey 
      respondents were asked, 'Has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's 
      ability to collaborate with other organizations on the support of trans survivors 
      of sexual assault?' and 'How has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's 
      ability to collaborate within the trans-LINK Network?'. Data were analyzed using 
      descriptive statistics. Seventy-eight member organizations participated in the 
      survey (response rate = 66%). Most organizations (79%) indicated that the 
      pandemic had affected their ability to collaborate with others in the network, 
      citing most commonly, increased workload (77%), increased demand for services 
      (57%), and technical and digital challenges (50%). Survey findings were shared in 
      a stakeholder consultation with 22 representatives of 21 network member 
      organizations. Stakeholders provided suggestions to prevent and address the 
      challenges, barriers, and disruptions in serving trans survivors experienced 
      during the pandemic, which were organized into themes. Seven themes were 
      generated and used as a scaffold for the development of recommendations to 
      advance the network, including: increase communication and knowledge exchange 
      among member organizations through the establishment of a network discussion 
      forum and capacity building group workshops; enhance awareness of network 
      organizations by developing a member-facing directory of member services, their 
      contributions, and ability to provide specific supports; strengthen capacity to 
      provide virtual and in-person services and programs through enhanced IT support 
      and increased opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill development; and 
      adopt a network wide syndemic approach that addresses co-occurring epidemics 
      (COVID-19 + racism, housing insecurity, transphobia, xenophobia) that impact 
      trans survivors of sexual assault.

TI  - The Association Between Social Network Characteristics and Tuberculosis Infection 
      Among Adults in 9 Rural Ugandan Communities.
PG  - e902-e909
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac669 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social network analysis can elucidate tuberculosis transmission 
      dynamics outside the home and may inform novel network-based case-finding 
      strategies. METHODS: We assessed the association between social network 
      characteristics and prevalent tuberculosis infection among residents (aged ≥15 
      years) of 9 rural communities in Eastern Uganda. Social contacts named during a 
      census were used to create community-specific nonhousehold social networks. We 
      evaluated whether social network structure and characteristics of first-degree 
      contacts (sex, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, tuberculosis infection) 
      were associated with revalent tuberculosis infection (positive tuberculin skin 
      test [TST] result) after adjusting for individual-level risk factors (age, sex, 
      HIV status, tuberculosis contact, wealth, occupation, and Bacillus 
      Calmette-Guérin [BCG] vaccination) with targeted maximum likelihood estimation. 
      RESULTS: Among 3 335 residents sampled for TST, 32% had a positive TST results 
      and 4% reported a tuberculosis contact. The social network contained 15 328 
      first-degree contacts. Persons with the most network centrality (top 10%) 
      (adjusted risk ratio, 1.3 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.1]) and the most (top 
      10%) male contacts (1.5 [1.3-1.9]) had a higher risk of prevalent tuberculosis, 
      than those in the remaining 90%. People with ≥1 contact with HIV (adjusted risk 
      ratio, 1.3 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.6]) and ≥2 contacts with tuberculosis 
      infection were more likely to have tuberculosis themselves (2.6 [ 95% confidence 
      interval: 2.2-2.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Social networks with higher centrality, more 
      men, contacts with HIV, and tuberculosis infection were positively associated 
      with tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis transmission within measurable social 
      networks may explain prevalent tuberculosis not associated with a household 
      contact. Further study on network-informed tuberculosis case finding 
      interventions is warranted.

      spread through Twitter.].
LID - e202106084 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time where social media allows 
      increased conversations about it. These conversations have spread various 
      conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to 
      develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible 
      information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of 
      this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign 
      #yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. 
      METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of 
      Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8(th) to 23(rd), 2020. Tweets 
      included content #yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS: A total of 6,080 interactions were 
      collected, 82% were tweets. Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36% 
      of traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from 
      Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48% of a sample of 50 Tweets the message 
      was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat COVID-19 
      pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The communication strategy of #yomevacuno hashtag, has 
      been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other campaigns 
      in which there was no large presence of public institutions. This case represents 
      the importance of social media as a way to spread information and prevention, 
      even in public health and the need for them to be led by public organizations 
      rather than by individual users.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has threatened the 
      state's governance and public safety. This study investigates whether and how 
      public participation can affect central government policy response to this 
      pandemic in the context of China. METHODS: This study constructs the theoretical 
      framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network Analysis is used to 
      analyze data on the public participation, New Media, and the central government 
      response in this pandemic. RESULTS: Findings show that the Chinese central 
      government does not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk 
      management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up governance 
      strategy triggered by public participation. In this process, New Media acts as a 
      catalyst. Specifically, when faced with a public emergency and needs a policy 
      response from the central government, public participation firstly creates 
      "participation" with the authority of the media, forms public opinion, and then 
      the prompt policy response from the central government. CONCLUSION: This study 
      confirms that the central government will refer to public participation to decide 
      the policy response. It also shows that the theory of government response applies 
      to both the local government and the central government.

LID - 10.1017/dmp.2020.32 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the way organizations were involved in the 
      response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV, MERS) 
      outbreak that occurred in Korea in 2015. DATA AND METHODS: We collected 
      organizational network data through a content analysis of online news articles 
      and the government's white paper. Social network analysis was used to analyze the 
      key organizations and their connections in crucial response tasks. RESULTS: Three 
      national health authorities (Central MERS Management Headquarters [CMMH], Korea 
      Centers for Disease Control [KCDC], Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW]) led 
      the response. CMMH, which did not appear in the government's response plans, 
      played a significant role in all 3 networks. KCDC also was involved in all 3 
      networks, but was most prominent in the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared 
      only in the patient management network. Each health authority coordinated and 
      collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the networks, but unclear 
      lines of responsibilities also were found. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated 
      that the roles and responsibilities of health authorities at the national level 
      were fragmented and lacked clarity. Public health emergency preparedness must 
      consider carefully the way to establish collaborative response systems.

TI  - Care and support networks of community-dwelling frail individuals in North West 
      London: a comparison of patient and healthcare workers' perceptions.
PG  - 953
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03561-y [doi]
LID - 953
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that successful assessment and care for frail 
      individuals requires integrated and collaborative care and support across and 
      within settings. Understanding the care and support networks of a frail 
      individual could therefore prove useful in understanding need and designing 
      support. This study explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling 
      older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of likely frailty, 
      by describing and comparing the individuals' networks as perceived by themselves 
      and as perceived by healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A 
      convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare professionals were 
      recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls Group' programme within North-West 
      London. Individual (i.e., one on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted 
      to establish an individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social 
      network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural characteristics of the 
      networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic analysis aided data interpretation. 
      RESULTS: All reported care and support networks showed a high contribution level 
      from family and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported 
      networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the 'frequency' and 
      'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare professional reported networks, the 
      reported frequency of interaction as detailed in patient records was used to 
      ascertain 'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the importance 
      of the role of informal carers and friends along with healthcare professionals in 
      the care of individuals living with frailty. There was congruence in the makeup 
      of 'patient' and 'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of 
      helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight the 
      multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which could be targeted 
      by healthcare professionals to support the care of frail individuals.

AB  - Nosocomial infections or hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are common health 
      problems affecting patients in human and animal hospitals. Herein, we 
      hypothesised that HAIs could be spread through human and animal movement, contact 
      with veterinary medical supplies, equipment, or instruments. We used a 
      combination of social network analysis and genotyping techniques to find key 
      players (or key nodes) and spread patterns using Escherichia coli as a marker. 
      This study was implemented in the critical care unit, outpatient department, 
      operation room, and ward of a small animal hospital. We conducted an 
      observational study used for key player determination (or key node 
      identification), then observed the selected key nodes twice with a one-month 
      interval. Next, surface swabs of key nodes and their connecting nodes were 
      analysed using bacterial identification, matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry, and pulsed-field gel 
      electrophoresis. Altogether, our results showed that veterinarians were key 
      players in this contact network in all departments. We found two predominant 
      similarity clusters; dendrogram results suggested E. coli isolates from different 
      time points and places to be closely related, providing evidence of HAI 
      circulation within and across hospital departments. This study could aid in 
      limiting the spread of HAIs in veterinary and human hospitals.

TI  - Evolution of a Coalition Network during a Whole-of-Community Intervention to 
      Prevent Early Childhood Obesity.
PG  - 379-390
LID - 10.1089/chi.2020.0156 [doi]
AB  - Background: Community coalitions often lead and coordinate "whole-of-community" 
      childhood obesity prevention interventions. A growing body of work suggests that 
      coalition network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and 
      advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This study provides 
      an understanding of the structure of coalition networks and how this structure 
      changes over time. Methods: We administered semiannual network surveys during a 
      pilot whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017). Participants 
      included 16 multisector coalition members and their nominated discussion partners 
      ("first-degree alters") related to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and 
      first-degree alter respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported 
      ties' interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were assessed with 
      visualization, descriptive analysis, and exponential random graph models. 
      Results: Total network included 558 stakeholders representing community-based 
      organizations, parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size 
      and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network (n = 256) during 
      intervention planning, and the largest proportion of stakeholders communicating 
      frequently (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak 
      intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected (1%-3% of possible 
      ties observed) and most and least centralized at baseline and follow-up, 
      respectively. Over time, ties were increasingly perceived as influential and 
      siloed within community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving 
      membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources, ideas, and an 
      ability to broadly disseminate intervention messages. The attenuating network 
      hierarchy over time may have supported more equal participation and control over 
      intervention efforts. Future research should assess generalizability of network 
      patterns, network influences on implementation processes, and possible network 
      interventions.

TI  - The anatomy of COVID-19 comorbidity networks among hospitalized Korean patients.
PG  - e2021035
LID - 10.4178/epih.e2021035 [doi]
LID - e2021035
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine how comorbidities were associated with outcomes 
      (illness severity or death) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Data were provided by the National Medical Center of 
      the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical 
      and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who 
      were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in Korea. We conducted comorbidity 
      network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors 
      associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was 
      the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen treatment not 
      needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or death. RESULTS: In total, 5,771 
      patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52) were 
      significantly associated with disease severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.00 to 
      14.31), heart failure (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15), malignancy (OR, 
      3.38; 95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.45 to 4.72), and 
      diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49) were associated with an 
      increased risk of death. Asthma and hypertension showed statistically 
      insignificant associations with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Underlying diseases contribute differently to the severity of COVID-19. To 
      efficiently allocate limited medical resources, underlying comorbidities should 
      be closely monitored, particularly CKD, COPD, and HF.

TI  - Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in China: Social 
      Media Content and Network Analysis Study.
PG  - e27009
LID - 10.2196/27009 [doi]
LID - e27009
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media is vital 
      for rumor control and disease containment during public health crises. Previous 
      research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or 
      simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well 
      as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the 
      attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under 
      multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of 
      the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information 
      characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo's 
      application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to 
      COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using 
      content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical 
      analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber 
      effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on 
      others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within 
      communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the 
      results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, 
      we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment 
      expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of 
      the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting 
      mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting 
      mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there 
      might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and 
      verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions 
      contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, 
      and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was 
      accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by 
      more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from 
      multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, 
      and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide 
      several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve 
      better rumor rebuttal.

TI  - Descriptive Study of Friendship Networks in Adolescents and Their Relationship 
      with Self-Efficacy and Alcohol Consumption Using Social Network Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191811527 [doi]
LID - 11527
AB  - Alcohol is a widely used legal drug. Self-efficacy takes on great importance in 
      an adolescent's development. Levels of self-efficacy can contribute to the 
      decision-making process of the adolescent. In this phase, a group of friends 
      becomes increasingly important. Alcohol is present in different social aspects. 
      Adolescents use alcohol as a social facilitator or as part of the development of 
      their autonomy. The purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the 
      structure of the friendship network, self-efficacy, and alcohol consumption in 
      adolescents. METHODS: We used an online platform with validated self-reported 
      questionnaires to collect the data. The sample consisted of 195 adolescents aged 
      between 16 and 18, from different educational centers in Bierzo (Spain). RESULTS: 
      It was found that 43.6% of the adolescents in our research were high-risk 
      consumers. Significant differences were obtained in terms of self-efficacy and 
      different network metrics. These networks were represented by considering the 
      levels of alcohol consumption. In the friendship network, we observed how the 
      central adolescents presented higher levels of self-efficacy and lower alcohol 
      consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy is established as a predictor of coping 
      and not consuming alcohol and adolescence as a crucial moment to implement 
      prevention strategies. Social Network Analysis is a useful tool that provides an 
      image of the context in which adolescents find themselves.

      scientific protection. Because of the uncertainty and life-cycle characteristics 
      of public health emergencies, emergency information release represents the 
      process of time dynamics. At present, it is an inevitable trend to establish a 
      collaborative mechanism for emergency information release of public health 
      emergencies to improve the release efficiency and respond to public demand. To 
      determine time evolution characteristics of organizational collaboration in 
      emergency information release, this study took the response to COVID-19 from the 
      central government of China as an example and conducted research based on social 
      network analysis. Based on information from COVID-19-related press conferences 
      held by China's central government, the emergency information release 
      collaborative networks (EIRCNs), and Emergency Organizations-Emergency 
      Information Release Matters (EOs-EIRMs) 2-mode network were constructed. With the 
      time evolution, the tightness, convergence, stability, and connectivity of EIRCNs 
      in public health emergencies presented the process of lowering and then raising. 
      At different stages, the core emergency organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs 
      continued to maintain a certain degree of activity. Their dynamic processes 
      showed the characteristics of diversification rather than homogeneity. The time 
      evolution of emergency information release matters (EIRMs) reflected the dynamic 
      adjustment of the government's prevention and control measures and responded to 
      the diversification of the public's understanding and protection needs during 
      different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further examined the driving 
      factors and implementation mechanism of the time evolution characteristics of the 
      collaborative mode of emergency information release. The implementation of EIRMs 
      at different stages had different resource requirements, which were usually 
      achieved by introducing new EOs (Adding resource increment) or increasing the 
      collaborative frequencies among EOs (Activating resource stock). In addition, 
      further research prospects and feasibility interpretation were proposed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordination of care requires information exchange between health 
      workers. The structure of their information exchange networks may influence the 
      quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to 
      explore and classify information exchange networks in primary care for patients 
      with chronic diseases in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried 
      out between 2019 and 2021. As part of a larger project on coordination of care, 
      this study focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients 
      with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure 
      (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of 
      connections, density and centralization for each of the health conditions for 
      each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed 
      typologies of information exchange networks in primary care practices. RESULTS: 
      We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25 practices were 
      included in the social network analysis. Four types of information exchange 
      structures were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected 
      networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with medium hierarchy, 
      medium connected networks with low hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly 
      connected networks with low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 
      networks for DM, 17 for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, 
      information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members. 
      Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with nurses 
      and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four types of information 
      exchange structures, which provides a practical tool for management and 
      improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer 
      connections and could hardly be considered a network. TRIAL REGISTRATION: We 
      registered the study prospectively on 7 November 2019 at the German Clinical 
      Trials Register (DRKS, www.drks.de ) under ID no. DRKS00019219.

AB  - Network analysis is a powerful tool to describe, estimate, and predict the role 
      of pig trade in the spread of pathogens and generate essential patterns that can 
      be used to understand, prevent, and mitigate possible outbreaks. This study aimed 
      to describe the network between premises such as production herds, 
      slaughterhouses, and traders of pig movements and identify heterogeneities in the 
      connectivity of premises in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, using social 
      network analysis (SNA). We used static and temporal network approaches to 
      describe pig trade in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA 
      parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of node-loyalty, 
      resilience of outgoing contact chains, and communities. Two indexes were 
      implemented, the first one is a normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures 
      and other index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd 
      population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized by a municipality 
      to target and rank surveillance activities. Within Santa Catarina, the southwest 
      region played a key role in that 80 % of trade was concentrated in this region, 
      and thus acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were found. The 
      results also showed that premises were highly connected in the static network, 
      with the network exhibiting low levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 
      11 % of the paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which 
      accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the use of 
      time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate potential transmission 
      pathways and outbreak sizes. Compared to static networks, the application of 
      temporal network approaches was more suitable to capture the dynamics of pig 
      trade and should be used to inform the design of riskbased disease surveillance.

TI  - Physician patient-sharing relationships and healthcare costs and utilization in 
      China: social network analysis based on health insurance data.
PG  - 798-806
LID - 10.1080/00325481.2021.1944650 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence on physician patient-sharing relationships from developing 
      countries is limited. This study aimed to identify patient-sharing networks among 
      physicians in China and explore the effect of attributes of physician networks on 
      healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was undertaken 
      based on healthcare claims from Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance Data 
      spanning the years 2015 to 2018. We identified patients with hypertension and 
      modeled physician patient-sharing networks using social network analysis. 
      Relationships among physicians were further quantified using network measures. We 
      fitted a log-linear model to examine the association between networks and 
      healthcare at the physician level. RESULTS: 29,321 patients, seen by 3,429 
      physicians from 57 hospitals in one eastern city of China were included. 
      Physicians were connected to 21 other physicians (threshold = 1 shared patients) 
      or 7 other physicians (threshold = 4, 6, or 8 shared patients). Degree and 
      centrality measures of physicians at primary care facilities were significantly 
      lower than those at secondary or tertiary hospitals (p < 0.001). The links 
      between physicians at different hospital grades were weak and patients tended to 
      flow among physicians at the same hospital grade. Compared with a low closeness 
      centrality, a medium level was associated with fewer hospitalization costs and 
      days, and high closeness centrality was accompanied by a sharper decrease (all P 
      < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians were located in peripheral 
      positions in China, and the links between primary care facilities and 
      higher-grade hospitals were still weak. Characteristics of physicians' networks 
      and the position of physicians in the network were associated with spending and 
      utilization of services, but not all associations were in the same direction.

TI  - Reaching marginalized young women for HIV prevention in Botswana: a pilot social 
      network analysis.
PG  - 74-81
LID - 10.1177/1757975918820803 [doi]
AB  - Almost one-fifth of Botswana's population is infected with HIV. The 
      Inter-Ministerial National Structural Intervention Trial is a trial to test the 
      impact on HIV rates of a structural intervention that refocuses government 
      structural support programs in favor of young women. Ensuring that the 
      intervention reaches all vulnerable young women in any given community is a 
      challenge. Door-to-door recruitment was inefficient in previous work, so we 
      explored innovative ways to reach this population. We sought to understand the 
      support networks of marginalized young women, and to test the possibility of 
      using social networks to support universal recruitment in this population. 
      Ego-centric and sociometric analyses were used to describe the support networks 
      of marginalized young women. Marginalized young women go to other women and 
      relatives for support, and they communicate face to face rather than using social 
      media. Network maps show how young women were connected to each other. Lessons 
      from the pilot include a better understanding of how to use social networks as a 
      recruitment method, such as the time required and the types of community members 
      that can help. Social networks could help reach other hard-to-reach populations.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 is closely related to the structure of human social 
      networks. Based on 237 cases, by using epidemiological retrospective statistics, 
      data visualization, and social network analysis methods, this paper summarized 
      characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Shaanxi, China, and analyzed these 
      patients' dynamic contact network structure. The study found that there are many 
      clustered infections through strong ties, about one-third of cases are caused by 
      relatives' infection. In early stages of the epidemic, imported cases were the 
      most, and in the later stages, local infection cases were the most. The infected 
      people were mostly middle-aged men. Symptoms of imported cases occurred on 
      average of 3 days after they arrived, and medical measures were taken 5 days 
      later on average. All cases showed symptoms in less than 2 days on average and 
      were then taken to medical treatment. The contact network can be divided into 
      multiple disconnected components. The largest component has 12 patients. The 
      average degree centrality in the network is 0.987, average betweenness degree is 
      0, average closeness degree is 0.452, and average PageRank index is 0.0042. The 
      number of contacts of patients is unevenly distributed in the network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased awareness of infection control precautions, 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still spreads through patients 
      and contaminated objects, causing a substantial burden of illness and cost. Our 
      objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health 
      care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care 
      network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. METHODS: We conducted a 
      case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or 
      colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, 
      sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built 
      from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over 
      time. RESULTS: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of 
      stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As 
      expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more 
      than 50%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential 
      source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected 
      to those same rooms proliferated. CONCLUSIONS: Only the network animation over 
      time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than 
      attributes measured in the traditional case control study.

TI  - A case study of university student networks and the COVID-19 pandemic using a 
      social network analysis approach in halls of residence.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt 
      their learning and have a reduced relational context. Adversity contexts build 
      models of human behaviour based on relationships. However, there is a lack of 
      studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social 
      structure in the context of a pandemic. This information could be useful in 
      making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities. The Social 
      Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural 
      perspective. The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of 
      students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more 
      in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive cross-sectional study was 
      carried out at one Spanish Public University, León, from 23th October 2020 to 
      20th November 2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of 
      residence. The data were collected from a database created specifically at the 
      university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. We applied the 
      SNA for the analysis of the data. The leadership on the university residence was 
      measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed using the 
      Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players. Students with higher social 
      reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to 
      COVID-19 infection. The results were statistically significant between the 
      centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most 
      leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the 
      key player structure in the network. Networking behaviour of university students 
      in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      This could be described on the basis of aspects of similarities between students, 
      and even leaders connecting the cohabitation sub-networks. In this context, 
      Social Network Analysis could be considered as a methodological approach for 
      future network studies in health emergency contexts.

TI  - The Role of Physician Networks and Receipt of Opioid-Related Payments.
PG  - 1812-1820
LID - 10.1007/s11606-022-07870-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid-related promotional payments are associated with increased 
      prescribing of the promoted drug, but little is known about whether physicians 
      receiving payments influence peers to accept similar payments. OBJECTIVE: We 
      examine the association of physician network-level position among peers and the 
      acceptance of opioid-related promotional payments using national publicly 
      available datasets from 2015. Design National cross-sectional data from the 
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) National Downloadable File and 
      Open Payment data. SUBJECTS: Physicians who shared Medicare patients with at 
      least two other physicians in 2015. MAIN MEASURES: Modified Poisson's regressions 
      are used to estimate the adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for social network 
      position (i.e., degree, betweenness, and transitivity) and number of peers with 
      payments as a function of individual receipt of opioid-related promotional 
      payment and among those with payments, those who have five or more payments, and 
      those who have $100 or more in payments. KEY RESULTS: Physicians with 
      opioid-related payments were significantly more likely to have at least one peer 
      with an opioid-related payment (IRR: 2.5, 95% CI: 2.3-2.8), but had fewer shared 
      patients (i.e., top quartile compared to the first quartile for degree 
      centrality: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.4) and belonged to less cohesive networks (i.e., 
      top quartile compared to the first quartile for betweenness centrality: 0.9, 95% 
      CI: 0.8-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that physicians receiving 
      opioid-related payments are more likely to cluster within physician networks.

AB  - The Food Chain Plus (FoCus) cohort was launched in 2011 for population-based 
      research related to metabolic inflammation. To characterize this novel pathology 
      in a comprehensive manner, data collection included multiple omics layers such as 
      phenomics, microbiomics, metabolomics, genomics, and metagenomics as well as 
      nutrition profiling, taste perception phenotyping and social network analysis. 
      The cohort was set-up to represent a Northern German population of the Kiel 
      region. Two-step recruitment included the randomised enrolment of participants 
      via residents' registration offices and via the Obesity Outpatient Centre of the 
      University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH). Hence, both a population- 
      and metabolic inflammation- based cohort was created. In total, 1795 individuals 
      were analysed at baseline. Baseline data collection took place between 2011 and 
      2014, including 63% females and 37% males with an age range of 18-83 years. The 
      median age of all participants was 52.0 years [IQR: 42.5; 63.0 years] and the 
      median baseline BMI in the study population was 27.7 kg/m(2) [IQR: 23.7; 
      35.9 kg/m(2)]. In the baseline cohort, 14.1% of participants had type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus, which was more prevalent in the subjects of the metabolic inflammation 
      group (MIG; 31.8%). Follow-up for the assessment of disease progression, as well 
      as the onset of new diseases with changes in subject's phenotype, diet or 
      lifestyle factors is planned every 5 years. The first follow-up period was 
      finished in 2020 and included 820 subjects.

TI  - Role of direct and indirect social and spatial ties in the diffusion of HIV and 
      HCV among people who inject drugs: a cross-sectional community-based network 
      analysis in New Delhi, India.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.69174 [doi]
LID - e69174
AB  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) account for some of the most explosive 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics 
      globally. While individual drivers of infection are well understood, less is 
      known about network factors, with minimal data beyond direct ties. METHODS: 2512 
      PWID in New Delhi, India were recruited in 2017-19 using a sociometric network 
      design. Sampling was initiated with 10 indexes who recruited named injection 
      partners (people who they injected with in the prior month). Each recruit then 
      recruited their named injection partners following the same process with 
      cross-network linkages established by biometric data. Participants responded to a 
      survey, including information on injection venues, and provided a blood sample. 
      Factors associated with HIV/HCV infection were identified using logistic 
      regression. RESULTS: The median age was 26; 99% were male. Baseline HIV 
      prevalence was 37.0% and 46.8% were actively infected with HCV (HCV RNA 
      positive). The odds of prevalent HIV and active HCV infection decreased with each 
      additional degree of separation from an infected alter (HIV AOR: 0.87; HCV AOR: 
      0.90) and increased among those who injected at a specific venue (HIV AOR: 1.50; 
      HCV AOR: 1.69) independent of individual-level factors (p<0.001). In addition, 
      sociometric factors, for example, network distance to an infected alter, were 
      statistically significant predictors even when considering immediate egocentric 
      ties. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an extremely high burden of HIV and HCV 
      infection and a highly interconnected injection and spatial network structure. 
      Incorporating network and spatial data into the design/implementation of 
      interventions may help interrupt transmission while improving efficiency.

OAB - Understanding the social and spatial relationships that connect people is a key 
      element to stop the spread of infectious diseases. These networks are 
      particularly relevant to combat epidemics among populations that are hard to 
      reach with public health interventions. Network-based approaches, for example, 
      can help to stop HIV or hepatitis C from spreading amongst populations that use 
      injectable drugs. Yet how social and geographic connections such as 
      acquaintances, injection partners, or preferred drug use places impact the risk 
      of infection is still poorly mapped out. To address this question, Clipman et al. 
      focused on people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India, a population heavily 
      impacted by HIV and hepatitis C. Over 2500 people were recruited, each 
      participant inviting their injection partners to also take part. The volunteers 
      answered survey questions, including where they used drugs, and provided a blood 
      sample to be tested. The results showed that, even after adjusting for individual 
      risk factors, where people used drugs and with whom affected their risk of 
      becoming infected with HIV and hepatitis C. In terms of social ties, the 
      likelihood of HIV and hepatitis C infection decreased by about 13% for each 
      person separating a given individual from an infected person. However, 
      geographical networks also had a major impact. Injecting at a popular location 
      respectively increased the odds of HIV and hepatitis C infection by 50% and 69%. 
      In fact, even if the participant was not using drugs at these specific places, 
      having an injection partner who did was enough to increase the risk for disease: 
      for each person separating an individual from the location, the likelihood of 
      being infected with HIV and hepatitis C decreased by respectively 14% and 10%. 
      The results by Clipman et al. highlight how the relationships between physical 
      spaces and social networks contribute to the spread of dangerous diseases amongst 
      people who inject drugs. Ultimately, this knowledge may help to shape better 
      public health interventions that would take into account the importance of 
      geographical locations.

PG  - 90-94
LID - 10.1126/science.add4507 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of monkeypox across non-endemic regions confirmed in May 2022 shows 
      epidemiological features distinct from previously imported outbreaks, most 
      notably its observed growth and predominance amongst men who have sex with men 
      (MSM). We use a transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data to 
      show that the heavy-tailed sexual partnership distribution, in which a handful of 
      individuals have disproportionately many partners, can explain the sustained 
      growth of monkeypox among MSM despite the absence of such patterns previously. We 
      suggest that the basic reproduction number (R(0)) for monkeypox over the MSM 
      sexual network may be substantially above 1, which poses challenges to outbreak 
      containment. Ensuring support and tailored messaging to facilitate prevention and 
      early detection among MSM with high numbers of partners is warranted.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak brought online learning to the forefront of education. 
      Scholars have conducted many studies on online learning during the pandemic, but 
      only a few have performed quantitative comparative analyses of students' online 
      learning behavior before and after the outbreak. We collected review data from 
      China's massive open online course platform called icourse.163 and performed 
      social network analysis on 15 courses to explore courses' interaction 
      characteristics before, during, and after the COVID-19 pan-demic. Specifically, 
      we focused on the following aspects: (1) variations in the scale of online 
      learning amid COVID-19; (2a) the characteristics of online learning interaction 
      during the pandemic; (2b) the characteristics of online learning interaction 
      after the pandemic; and (3) differences in the interaction characteristics of 
      social science courses and natural science courses. Results revealed that only a 
      small number of courses witnessed an uptick in online interaction, suggesting 
      that the pandemic's role in promoting the scale of courses was not significant. 
      During the pandemic, online learning interaction became more frequent among 
      course network members whose interaction scale increased. After the pandemic, 
      although the scale of interaction declined, online learning interaction became 
      more effective. The scale and level of interaction in Electrodynamics (a natural 
      science course) and Economics (a social science course) both rose during the 
      pan-demic. However, long after the pandemic, the Economics course sustained 
      online interaction whereas interaction in the Electrodynamics course steadily 
      declined. This discrepancy could be due to the unique characteristics of natural 
      science courses and social science courses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social media, an essential source of public access to information 
      regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, has a significant effect on the transmission of 
      information regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and helps the public gain correct 
      insights into the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. The 
      forwarding behavior of social media users on posts concerned with COVID-19 
      vaccine topics can rapidly disseminate vaccine information in a short period, 
      which has a significant effect on transmission and helps the public access 
      relevant information. However, the factors of social media users' forwarding 
      posts are still uncertain thus far. In this paper, we investigated the factors of 
      the forwarding COVID-19 vaccines Weibo posts on Chinese social media and verified 
      the correlation between social network characteristics, Weibo textual sentiment 
      characteristics, and post forwarding. METHODS: This paper used data mining, 
      machine learning, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and regression 
      analysis. Using " (COVID-19 vaccine)" as the keyword, we used data mining to 
      crawl 121,834 Weibo posts on Sina Weibo from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2021. Weibo 
      posts not closely correlated with the topic of the COVID-19 vaccines were 
      filtered out using machine learning. In the end, 3,158 posts were used for data 
      analysis. The proportions of positive sentiment and negative sentiment in the 
      textual of Weibo posts were calculated through sentiment analysis. On that basis, 
      the sentiment characteristics of Weibo posts were determined. The social network 
      characteristics of information transmission on the COVID-19 vaccine topic were 
      determined through social network analysis. The correlation between social 
      network characteristics, sentiment characteristics of the text, and the 
      forwarding volume of posts was verified through regression analysis. RESULTS: The 
      results suggest that there was a significant positive correlation between the 
      degree of posting users in the social network structure and the amount of 
      forwarding. The relationship between the closeness centrality and the forwarding 
      volume was significantly positive. The betweenness centrality was significantly 
      positively correlated with the forwarding volume. There was no significant 
      relationship between the number of posts containing more positive sentiments and 
      the forwarding volume of posts. There was a significant positive correlation 
      between the number of Weibo posts containing more negative sentiments and the 
      forwarding volume. CONCLUSION: According to the characteristics of users, 
      COVID-19 vaccine posts from opinion leaders, "gatekeepers," and users with 
      high-closeness centrality are more likely to be reposted. Users with these 
      characteristics should be valued for their important role in disseminating 
      information about COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the sentiment contained in the 
      Weibo post is an important factor influencing the public to forward vaccine 
      posts. Special attention should be paid to the negative sentimental tendency 
      contained in this post on Weibo to mitigate the negative impact of the 
      information epidemic and improve the transmission effect of COVID-19 vaccine 
      information.

TI  - Spatial Correlation of Air Pollution and Its Causes in Northeast China.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182010619 [doi]
LID - 10619
AB  - To understand the status of air pollution in northeastern China, we explore the 
      structure of air pollution transmission networks and propose targeted policy 
      recommendations. Using air pollution data from 35 cities in northeastern China 
      for a total of 879 periods from 6 January 2015 to 3 June 2017, this paper used 
      social network analysis (SNA) to construct a spatial association network of air 
      pollution in the region, and analyzed the spatial association of air pollution 
      among cities and its causes in an attempt to reveal the transmission path of air 
      pollution in the region. The results show that inter-city air pollution in 
      northeast China forms a complex and stable correlation network with obvious 
      seasonal differences of "high in winter and low in summer". Different cities in 
      the region play the roles of "spillover", "intermediary" and "receiver" of air 
      pollution in the network. Small respirable particulate (PM2.5) pollution 
      constitutes a significant component of air pollution in northeast China, which 
      spreads from Liaoning province to Heilongjiang province via Jilin province. 
      Therefore, regional joint pollution prevention and control measures should be 
      adopted to combat the air pollution problem, and different treatment measures 
      should be developed for different city "roles" in the pollution network, in order 
      to fundamentally solve the air pollution problem in the region.

TI  - An Emergent Network for the Diffusion of Innovations Among Local Health 
      Departments at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - E19
LID - 10.5888/pcd18.200536 [doi]
LID - E19
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for 
      accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health departments (LHDs) 
      drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could prove valuable during public 
      health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were 
      tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about 
      innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In 
      January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD 
      leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked 
      respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new 
      public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to 
      improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess 
      answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to 
      operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers 
      as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as 
      relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary 
      spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed 
      neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health 
      departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of 
      interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in 
      disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our 
      results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.

TI  - Ending the HIV epidemic using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS): 
      Recommendations based on DC model.
PG  - e0253594
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0253594 [doi]
LID - e0253594
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social network strategies have been used by health departments to 
      identify undiagnosed cases of HIV. Heterosexual cycle (HET4) of National HIV 
      Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) is a social network strategy implemented in 
      jurisdictions. The main objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate the 
      utility of the NHBS HET cycle data for network analysis; 2) to apply statistical 
      analysis in support of previous HIV research, as well as to develop new research 
      results focused on demographic variables and prevention/intervention with respect 
      to heterosexual HIV risk; and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with 
      respect to the EHE plan. METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A 
      total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis 
      package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix 
      representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine 
      the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models 
      representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) 
      prevention-intervention effects. RESULTS: The results showed 3% were tested 
      positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); 
      seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 
      HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing 
      positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) 
      (25.645); 95 CI% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning 
      citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model higher 
      association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness among those tested 
      negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV intervention in the past 12 months with 
      those tested positive ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: The network 
      visualization was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the 
      success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network strategy to find 
      new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest behavioral supplements for DC's 
      HIV planning activities. As part of the evaluation process our analysis helps to 
      understand the impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on 
      peoples' HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions use network 
      visualizations to evaluate the efficacy in reaching hidden populations.

TI  - Do Informational and Emotional Elements Differ between Online Psychological and 
      Physiological Disease Communities in China? A Comparative Study of Depression and 
      Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19042167 [doi]
LID - 2167
AB  - Disease-specific online health communities provide a convenient and common 
      platform for patients to share experiences, change information, provide and 
      receive social support. This study aimed to compare differences between online 
      psychological and physiological disease communities in topics, sentiment, 
      participation, and emotional contagion patterns using multiple methods as well as 
      to discuss how to satisfy the users' different informational and emotional needs. 
      We chose the online depression and diabetes communities on the Baidu Tieba 
      platform as the data source. Topic modeling and theme coding were employed to 
      analyze discussion preferences for various topic categories. Sentiment analysis 
      was used to identify the sentiment polarity of each post and comment. The social 
      network was used to represent the users' interaction and emotional flows to 
      discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion patterns 
      between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results revealed 
      that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social 
      relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss 
      treatment and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were 
      obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core users in the 
      negative emotional contagion network. In the diabetes community, emotional 
      contagion was less prevalent and core users in positive and negative emotional 
      contagion networks were basically the same. The study reveals insights into the 
      differences between online psychological and physiological disease communities, 
      providing a greater understanding of the users' informational and emotional needs 
      expressed online. These results are helpful for society to provide actual medical 
      assistance and deploy health interventions based on disease types.

AB  - In terms of pig production in China, Hunan was the third largest province where 
      the number of hogs accounted for 9.0 % of the national number of hogs in 2017. To 
      propose the precise strategy for supervision of pig movements in Hunan Province, 
      a weighted directed one-mode network was constructed using the data from the 
      electronic animal health certificate platform in 2017. The nodes were designed as 
      districts in Hunan and edges as flows of pig movement between districts. Social 
      network analysis was used to analyse network characteristics and generalized 
      linear models were performed to ascertain the socioeconomic factors that affect 
      the pig movement network. During 2017, the pig movement network within the Hunan 
      Province was composed of 122 nodes and 8562 directed connections, with a total of 
      510,973 shipments and 17,815,040 pigs moved. The network displayed a small-world 
      topology, which had a higher clustering coefficient (0.4 vs. 0.1) and shorter 
      average shortest path length (1.8 vs. 3.7) compared with equivalent random 
      networks. The degree centrality positively correlated with closeness centrality 
      (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) as well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). 
      After restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the top 10 % of 
      degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by nearly 50 % in the network, 
      whereas the number of pigs was reduced by 94.0 % when movement restrictions were 
      implemented in areas with the top 50 % of degree centrality. Observed network 
      metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking in November and 
      December. Generalized linear models showed that the size of the human population 
      and per capita gross domestic product were the most important socioeconomic 
      drivers of pig movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a 
      small-world network in which the introduction and spread of diseases may be 
      quicker. More human, material, and financial resources should be allocated to 
      areas with higher centrality. Swine movements were seasonal, and the inspection 
      and quarantine work should be reinforced in the fourth quarter, especially in 
      November and December. Pig movements were more active in areas with larger 
      populations and advanced economy, and stricter supervision in these areas should 
      be implemented. Our findings contribute to understanding the movement of pigs and 
      the associated influencing factors in a big pig producing province in China, and 
      the supervision strategies proposed in this study can be extended to other 
      regions in China if proved to be viable.

TI  - Social Network Analysis of the Schistosomiasis control program in two local 
      government areas in Oyo state, Nigeria: Insights for NTD elimination plans.
PG  - e0011266
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0011266 [doi]
LID - e0011266
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases targeted 
      for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease elimination requires collaboration 
      between stakeholders, country ownership and the involvement of community-level 
      stakeholders. The state of stakeholder relationship determines the ease and 
      timeliness of meeting disease elimination targets. Mapping stakeholder 
      relationships is critical for assessing gaps in the schistosomiasis control 
      program implementation, and providing a roadmap for improved stakeholder 
      cohesion. The study aimed to measure the cohesiveness of the contact, 
      collaboration and resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in 
      Oyo state, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a Network 
      Representative design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The study was conducted 
      within Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North 
      (urban) and Akinyele (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a link-tracing 
      approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from stakeholders across 
      the state, local government, healthcare, academia, and non-governmental 
      organizations. Data was analysed using Gephi software for network cohesion across 
      the three networks. RESULTS: The social network analysis revealed high clustering 
      and low density across the three networks implying low cohesion across multiple 
      stakeholder categories. The contact and collaborative networks were the most 
      active with the lowest level of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network. 
      Stakeholders were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and stakeholders 
      within the organized governance and public health system were the dominant actors 
      in the schistosomiasis control program. CONCLUSION: The low cohesion, high 
      clustering and low network density among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis 
      control program should be addressed in other to drive innovation and meet the WHO 
      schistosomiasis elimination target.

AB  - We analyze 6 months of Twitter conversations related to the Chilean Covid-19 
      vaccination process, in order to understand the online forces that argue for or 
      against it and suggest effective digital communication strategies. Using AI, we 
      classify accounts into four categories that emerge from the data as a result of 
      the type of language used. This classification naturally distinguishes pro- and 
      anti-vaccine activists from moderates that promote or inhibit vaccination in 
      discussions, which also play a key role that should be addressed by public 
      policies. We find that all categories display relatively constant opinions, but 
      that the number of tweeting accounts grows in each category during controversial 
      periods. We also find that accounts disfavoring vaccination tend to appear in the 
      periphery of the interaction network, which is consistent with Chile's high 
      immunization levels. However, these are more active in addressing those favoring 
      vaccination than vice-versa, revealing a potential communication problem even in 
      a society where the antivaccine movement has no central role. Our results 
      highlight the importance of social network analysis to understand public 
      discussions and suggest online interventions that can help achieve successful 
      immunization campaigns.

TI  - Network analysis of dairy cattle movement and associations with bovine 
      tuberculosis spread and control in emerging dairy belts of Ethiopia.
PG  - 262

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy cattle movement could be a major risk factor for the spread of 
      bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in emerging dairy belts of Ethiopia. Dairy cattle may 
      be moved between farms over long distances, and hence understanding the route and 
      frequency of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread of BTB 
      between farms, which could ultimately help to inform policy makers to design cost 
      effective control strategies. The objective of this study was, therefore, to 
      investigate the network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on 
      the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas among the 
      Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa, Gondar and Mekelle. METHODS: 
      A questionnaire survey was conducted in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern 
      of dairy cattle movement for the last 5 years (September 2013 to August 2018). 
      Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the relationship between 
      the network patterns and the prevalence of BTB in these regions were made using 
      social network analysis. RESULTS: The cattle movement network structure display 
      both scale free and small world properties implying local clustering with fewer 
      farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection, with the potential to 
      act as super spreaders of BTB if infected. Farms having a history of cattle 
      movements onto the herds were more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) 
      compared to farms not having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and 
      the batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with prevalence of 
      BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more outgoing cattle showed a 
      decrease on the likelihood of BTB infection (OR = 0.57) compared to farms which 
      maintained their cattle. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the patterns of 
      cattle movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to the 
      potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk of transmission 
      potential could be efficiently targeted by control measures aimed at reducing the 
      spread of BTB. The network structure described can also provide the starting 
      point to build and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other 
      infectious diseases.

TI  - Analysis of Influencing Factors of Urban Community Function Loss in China under 
      Flood Disaster Based on Social Network Analysis Model.

LID - 11094
AB  - The increasing frequency of floods is causing an increasing impact on urban 
      communities. To identify the key influencing factors of functional loss in 
      Chinese urban communities under floods, this paper explored the influencing 
      factors and factor combinations through a social network analysis approach using 
      the 265 cases of urban communities in China affected by floods collected from 
      2017-2021 as research data. The key influencing factors and factor combinations 
      were identified comprehensively using multiple indicator analyses such as 
      core-periphery structure, node centrality, and factor pairing. The analysis 
      results showed that "road disruption", "housing inundation", and "power 
      interruption" are the three most critical factors affecting the functional loss 
      of urban communities in China under floods, followed by "residents trapped", 
      "enterprises flooded", and "silt accumulation". In addition, "road 
      disruption-housing inundation", "housing inundation-residents trapped", and "road 
      disruption-residents trapped" are the most common combinations of influencing 
      factors.

TI  - Modelling control strategies against classical swine fever: Influence of traders 
      and markets using static and temporal networks in Ecuador.

AB  - Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and cultural sector, 
      challenged by classical swine fever (CSF). Recently, the National Veterinary 
      Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing 
      pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our 
      objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model 
      the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal 
      evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, 
      infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were 
      used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 
      2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial 
      farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the 
      Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most 
      influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations 
      without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 %; 
      targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 %, while with random 
      movement restriction it was 13 %. Targeting the top 10 national traders and 
      markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best 
      strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major 
      influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the 
      static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 
      38 % overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the 
      network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS 
      surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk 
      premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would 
      make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to 
      implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other 
      infectious animal diseases.

TI  - Pig trade networks through live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China.
PG  - 1315-1329
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13472 [doi]
AB  - This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect contact 
      network between counties through the movement of live pigs through four wholesale 
      live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for 
      January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig 
      trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement 
      pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary 
      objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the 
      trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were 
      calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts 
      of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic 
      spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were 
      delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. 
      More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded 
      in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were 
      predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with 
      counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source 
      counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month 
      study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the 
      markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June 
      indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher 
      clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 
      vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in 
      the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with 
      randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher 
      betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude 
      of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform 
      targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market 
      trade network in south China.

TI  - Analysis of the Characteristics and Causes of Night Tourism Accidents in China 
      Based on SNA and QAP Methods.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20032584 [doi]
LID - 2584
AB  - The key purpose of this paper is to address an inherent gap in the literature on 
      safety issues in the development of night tourism. This research takes a novel 
      methodological approach, by using 8787 cases of tourism safety accidents in 
      typical night tourism cities in China, and applying social network analysis (SNA) 
      and quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression analysis to explore the 
      multidimensional structural characteristics and risk-causing factors of night 
      tourism accidents. Key findings include: (1) Amidst the complexity and diversity 
      of the night tourism safety accidents in cities, disastrous accidents, public 
      health accidents, natural disasters, and social security accidents are the main 
      types of night tourism safety accidents. (2) Night tourism safety accidents have 
      strong aggregation in specific time periods and spatial regions. There are 
      differences in the timepoint and duration of each accident type, showing 
      different distribution characteristics in different cities and locations. (3) 
      Distribution of accident types in night tourism products shows obvious core-edge 
      structure characteristics. (4) The degree of co-occurrence of four risk-inducing 
      factors, i.e., personnel, facilities, environment, and management, has high 
      explanatory power at the accident correlation level in the co-occurrence network 
      of night tourism safety accidents in cities, and the influence effects of risk 
      factors are heterogeneous at different timepoints. Our results provide some 
      valuable implications for optimizing night tourism safety governance in cities.

TI  - Korea's Response to COVID-19 According to Set Time Frames, With a Focus on the 
      Network Between the Government and Responding Agencies: Social Network Analysis.
PG  - e35958
LID - 10.2196/35958 [doi]
LID - e35958
AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, COVID-19 was first confirmed in Wuhan, China, and 
      as the respiratory disease spread around the globe, there was a spike in interest 
      worldwide in combating such contagious diseases. When such disasters occur, the 
      central government of South Korea and its affiliated local governments-together 
      with nongovernmental organizations-play a crucial role in crisis management 
      systems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to corroborate the 
      characteristics government ministries and domestic and foreign institutions 
      exhibit through their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a 
      disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the 
      social network analysis technique, the span of the COVID-19 pandemic was 
      segmented into 3 time frames, and the relational characteristics of the COVID-19 
      contagious disease response department and related agencies at home and abroad 
      were analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the second and 
      third time frames indicates that the agents reacting to contagious diseases do 
      not necessarily hold the central position in the network. From this, it can be 
      inferred that it is not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the 
      key to a successful response to various disasters also lies in cooperation with 
      the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruency between the findings of this 
      paper and the existing disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that 
      both the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate for a 
      coordinated crisis response in disaster situations. Furthermore, much 
      significance lies in the fact that this paper explores the various aspects that 
      could surface among the host and relevant parties in a real-life pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis aims to assess whether injection drug use cessation 
      among peers predicts injection drug use cessation among individuals and explores 
      whether this association varies by relationship type and strength. METHODS: Data 
      were collected through baseline and 6-month assessments for the Social Networks 
      among Appalachian People study (2008-2011). Interviewer-administered surveys 
      collected sociodemographic and drug use behaviors (past 6 months and lifetime). 
      Participants also listed sex, drug use, and social support partners (past 6 
      months). Listed names were cross-referenced with survey participants to identify 
      relationships between study participants. The analytic sample was further 
      restricted to include only those relationship pairs where both individuals 
      reported a history of injection drug use at baseline (n = 244 unique individuals 
      and 746 dyads). We fit a generalized estimating equations logistic 
      regression model to (1) assess the relationship between peer injection cessation 
      and individual injection cessation and (2) determine whether the strength of this 
      association differs by relationship-level variables (i.e., relationship role, 
      relationship type, relationship duration, frequency of interaction, residential 
      proximity). RESULTS: Overall, those with a network member who ceased injection 
      drug use were more likely to stop injecting over the following 6-month period 
      (AOR=1.65). The magnitude of this association was greater for social support 
      partners (AOR=2.95), family members (AOR=3.56), those with whom the participant 
      interacted at least daily (AOR=2.17), and those who the participant knew longer 
      (AOR=2.09). Further, among family members, the effect size was greater when 
      relationships were further restricted to immediate family members (AOR=5.35). 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in this rural community, closer, more 
      supportive relationships, may be more influential for modeling injection 
      cessation; however, relationship-types were not mutually exclusive so differences 
      in effect size across strata may not be statistically significant. In this 
      setting, social support through the recovery process (including cessation 
      attempts with peers) may increase likelihood of injection cessation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We reconstructed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak to 
      examine how a large cluster at a church setting spread before being detected and 
      estimate the potential effectiveness of complying with mask-wearing guidelines 
      recommended by the government. METHODS: A mathematical model with a social 
      network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A 
      discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of 
      COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a 
      calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of 
      complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a 
      mask-wearing ratio of 67% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the 
      confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95% mask-wearing estimated an 
      average of 45.6 (95% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. 
      The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing 
      guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of 
      COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on 
      simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social 
      distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts 
      and interactions are unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be 
      beneficial to develop precise measures and guidelines for particular 
      organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster outbreaks.

TI  - Exploring the association between school-based peer networks and smoking 
      according to socioeconomic status and tobacco control context: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 142

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whilst prevalence of youth smoking in middle and high income 
      countries has decreased, inequality has prevailed. The introduction of 
      legislation regulating tobacco use in public spaces varies across countries, 
      impacting the tobacco control context. Thus reviewing our knowledge of how social 
      networks may influence smoking differently within different contexts is required 
      to facilitate the development of context-specific interventions. METHODS: The 
      search, conducted on 31st May 2019, included the following smoking-related terms; 
      schools, adolescents, peers and social networks. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
      were applied throughout the title and abstract screening and full text screening. 
      Quality assessment and synthesis followed. Studies were narratively synthesised 
      to identify changes according to legislative context. This synthesis was 
      conducted separately for findings relating to three categories: socioeconomic 
      status; social selection and influence; and network position. RESULTS: Thirty 
      studies were included. Differences in the relationship between network 
      characteristics and smoking according to socioeconomic status were measured in 
      five out of fifteen studies in Europe. Results varied across studies, with 
      differences in network characteristics and their association with smoking varying 
      both between schools of a differing and those of a similar socioeconomic 
      composition. For studies conducted both before and after the introduction of 
      comprehensive smoking legislation, the evidence for selection processes was more 
      consistent than influence, which varied according to reciprocity. Findings showed 
      that isolates were more likely to smoke and in-degree and out-degree centrality 
      were related to smoking both before and after the introduction of legislation. 
      The relationship between popularity and smoking was contingent on school level 
      smoking prevalence in studies conducted before the introduction of legislation, 
      but not after. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, effects according to socioeconomic status 
      were underreported in the included studies and no consistent evidence of change 
      after the introduction of a comprehensive smoking ban was observed. Further 
      network analyses are required using more recent data to obtain a comprehensive 
      understanding of how network processes may influence smoking differently 
      according to socioeconomic status, and how adaptation could be used to enhance 
      intervention effectiveness. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: International

LID - e042773
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the physical activity carried out by the adolescents in 
      the study, its relationship to being overweight (overweight+obese) and to analyse 
      the structure of the social network of friendship established in adolescents 
      doing group sports, using different parameters indicative of centrality. SETTING: 
      It was carried out in an educational environment, in 11 classrooms belonging to 5 
      Schools in Ponferrada (Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 235 adolescents were included in the 
      study (49.4% female), who were classified as normal weight or overweight. PRIMARY 
      AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents 
      (PAQ-A) was used to study the level of physical activity. A social network 
      analysis was carried out to analyse structural variables of centrality in 
      different degrees of contact. RESULTS: 30.2% of the participants in our study 
      were overweight. Relative to female participants in this study, males obtained 
      significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A (OR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.04 to 4.25; p 
      value: 0.036) and were more likely to participate in group sport (OR: 4.59; 95% 
      CI: 2.28 to 9.22; p value: 0.000). We found no significant relationship between 
      physical activity and the weight status in the total sample, but among female 
      participants, those with overweight status had higher odds of reporting high 
      levels of physical exercise (OR: 4.50; 95% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In 
      terms of centrality, differentiating by gender, women who participated in group 
      sports were more likely to be classified as having low values of centrality, 
      while the opposite effect occurred for men, more likely to be classified as 
      having high values of centrality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, with limitations, 
      underline the importance of two fundamental aspects to be taken into account in 
      the design of future strategies: gender and the centrality within the social 
      network depending on the intensity of contact they have with their peers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Care fragmentation is associated with higher rates of infection after 
      durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant. Less is known about the 
      relationship between care fragmentation and total spending, and whether this 
      relationship is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured 
      from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network theory, a measure 
      of care fragmentation was developed based on the number of shared patients among 
      providers (ie, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care 
      specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring for 4,987 Medicare 
      beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation between July 2009 - April 2017. Care 
      fragmentation was measured using average path length, which describes how 
      efficiently information flows among network members; longer path length indicates 
      greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of care fragmentation and 
      multivariable regression were used to analyze the relationship between care 
      fragmentation and LVAD payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the 
      role of post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81% male, 73% 
      white, 11% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of 63.1 years (11.1). The mean 
      (SD) level of care fragmentation in provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) 
      payment from admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872). Mean 
      (SD) total payments at the lower, middle, and upper terciles of care 
      fragmentation were $250,135 ($111,924), $243,288 ($109,376), and $247,290 
      ($108,241), respectively. In mediation analysis, the indirect effect of care 
      fragmentation on total payments, through infections, was positive and 
      statistically significant (β=16032.5, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Greater care 
      fragmentation in the delivery of care surrounding durable LVAD implantation is 
      associated with a higher incidence of infections, and consequently, higher 
      payments for Medicare beneficiaries. Interventions to reduce care fragmentation 
      may reduce the incidence of infections and in turn enhance the value of care for 
      patients undergoing durable LVAD implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states 
      reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were confirmed in 
      Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination 
      behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known 
      to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they 
      convey, and (3) the spread of this content. METHODS: Our data set consisted of 
      197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message 
      promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content 
      using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an 
      in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; 
      Cohen's κ ranged 0.71-1.0 after double-coding. RESULTS: The majority (89%) of 
      individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their 
      location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network 
      of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups 
      labelled as "trust," "alternatives," "safety," and "conspiracy." For example, a 
      comment representative of "conspiracy" is that poliovirus does not exist and that 
      pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the "alternatives" 
      sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative 
      analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that these individuals also 
      tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water 
      fluoridation and circumcision. CONCLUSIONS: Social media outlets may facilitate 
      anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of 
      centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse 
      but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for 
      health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, 
      targeted messages to different constituencies.

AB  - (i) analyze connectivity between subgroups of university students, (ii) assess 
      which bridges of relational contacts are essential for connecting or 
      disconnecting subgroups and (iii) to explore the similarities between the 
      attributes of the subgroup nodes in relation to the pandemic context. During the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, young university students have experienced significant changes 
      in their relationships, especially in the halls of residence. Previous research 
      has shown the importance of relationship structure in contagion processes. 
      However, there is a lack of studies in the university setting, where students 
      live closely together. The case study methodology was applied to carry out a 
      descriptive study. The participation consisted of 43 university students living 
      in the same hall of residence. Social network analysis has been applied for data 
      analysis. Factions and Girvan-Newman algorithms have been applied to detect the 
      existing cohesive subgroups. The UCINET tool was used for the calculation of the 
      SNA measure. A visualization of the global network will be carried out using 
      Gephi software. After applying the Girvan-Newman and Factions, in both cases it 
      was found that the best division into subgroups was the one that divided the 
      network into 4 subgroups. There is high degree of cohesion within the subgroups 
      and a low cohesion between them. The relationship between subgroup membership and 
      gender was significant. The degree of COVID-19 infection is related to the degree 
      of clustering between the students. College students form subgroups in their 
      residence. Social network analysis facilitates an understanding of structural 
      behavior during the pandemic. The study provides evidence on the importance of 
      gender, race and the building where they live in creating network structures that 
      favor, or not, contagion during a pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Universities are vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks, making 
      them ideal environments to study transmission dynamics and evaluate mitigation 
      and surveillance measures. Here, we analyze multimodal COVID-19-associated data 
      collected during the 2020-2021 academic year at Colorado Mesa University and 
      introduce a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and response framework. METHODS: We analyzed 
      epidemiological and sociobehavioral data (demographics, contact tracing, and 
      WiFi-based co-location data) alongside pathogen surveillance data (wastewater and 
      diagnostic testing, and viral genomic sequencing of wastewater and clinical 
      specimens) to characterize outbreak dynamics and inform policy. We applied 
      relative risk, multiple linear regression, and social network assortativity to 
      identify attributes or behaviors associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2. To 
      characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we used viral sequencing, phylogenomic 
      tools, and functional assays. FINDINGS: Athletes, particularly those on 
      high-contact teams, had the highest risk of testing positive. On average, 
      individuals who tested positive had more contacts and longer interaction 
      durations than individuals who never tested positive. The distribution of 
      contacts per individual was overdispersed, although not as overdispersed as the 
      distribution of phylogenomic descendants. Corroboration via technical replicates 
      was essential for identification of wastewater mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 
      our findings, we formulate a framework that combines tools into an integrated 
      disease surveillance program that can be implemented in other congregate settings 
      with limited resources. FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Science

AB  - Pandemics caused by pathogens that originate in wildlife highlight the importance 
      of understanding the behavioral ecology of disease outbreaks at human-wildlife 
      interfaces. Specifically, the relative effects of human-wildlife and 
      wildlife-wildlife interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in 
      urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social network analysis 
      and epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate 
      zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint propensities to 
      co-interact with humans, and their social grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups 
      of macaques (Macaca spp.) in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected 
      behavioral data using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the 
      same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social interactions with 
      conspecifics and overall anthropogenic exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes 
      were related to structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species, 
      and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social (grooming) contexts, 
      outbreak sizes were positively correlated to the network centrality of 
      first-infected macaques. Across host species and contexts, the above effects were 
      stronger through macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their 
      grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques. Long-tailed 
      macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in these effects. Our findings 
      suggest that among wildlife in anthropogenically-impacted environments, the 
      structure of their aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more 
      vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social structure. The global 
      features of these networks that influence disease outbreaks, and their underlying 
      socio-ecological covariates, need further investigation. Animals that 
      consistently interact with both humans and their conspecifics are important 
      targets for disease control.

TI  - Epidemic Vulnerability Index for Effective Vaccine Distribution Against Pandemic.
PG  - 3332-3342
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2022.3198365 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 vaccine distribution route directly impacts the community's mortality 
      and infection rate. Therefore, optimal vaccination dissemination would 
      appreciably lower the death and infection rates. This paper proposes the Epidemic 
      Vulnerability Index (EVI) that quantitatively evaluates the subject's potential 
      risk. Our primary aim for the suggested index is to diminish both infection rate 
      and death rate efficiently. EVI was accordingly designed with clinical factors 
      determining the mortality and social factors incorporating the infection rate. 
      Through statistical COVID-19 patient dataset analysis and social network analysis 
      with an agent-based model that is analogous to a real-world system, we define and 
      experimentally validate the capability of EVI. Our experiments consist of nine 
      vaccination distribution scenarios, including existing indexes which estimate the 
      risk and stochastically proliferate the contagion and vaccine in a 300,000 
      agent-based graph network. We compared the outcome and variation of the three 
      metrics in the experiments: infection case, death case, and death rate. Through 
      this assessment, vaccination by the descending order of EVI has shown to have a 
      significant outcome with an average of 5.0% lower infection cases, 9.4% lower 
      death cases, and 3.5% lower death rate than other vaccine distribution routes.

TI  - A COVID-19 nosocomial cluster in a university hospital in southern Italy: a 
      social network analysis.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.7416/ai.2022.2519 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers on duty at the hospital are at high risk of 
      COVID-19 infection. However, despite the introduction of risk-lowering practices 
      in the hospital setting, there have been many cases of SARS-COV-2 infection among 
      Health Care Workers. Fast and efficient contact tracing and Sars-CoV-2 PCR-based 
      testing of the close contacts of Health Care Workers with confirmed infections 
      are essential steps to limit nosocomial outbreaks. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study was conducted at Bari Policlinico General University-Hospital (Apulia, 
      Italy) and describes the management of a cluster of SARS-COV-2 infections in 
      three Operative Units. The contact tracing activities and the measures 
      implemented to control the outbreak are described. RESULTS: Among the 186 Health 
      Care Workers active in the cluster setting, there were 9 (4.8%) confirmed cases, 
      including the index case. Due to the outbreak, three Operative Units were closed 
      to limit virus circulation. Health Care Workers with confirmed infections tested 
      negative after a mean of 28.0±6.6 days (range: 13-37) and none required 
      hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the health of Health Care Workers 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic should be a public health priority. However, despite 
      recent recommendations and the implementation of protective measures, SARS-COV-2 
      infections of Health Care Workers remain at a high rate, indicative of the 
      continued high risk of cluster onset in the nosocomial setting.

AB  - The spread of infectious diseases is highly related to the structure of human 
      networks. Analyzing the contact network of patients can help clarify the path of 
      virus transmission. Based on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in two major tourist 
      provinces in southern China (Hainan and Yunnan), this study analyzed the 
      epidemiological characteristics and dynamic contact network structure of patients 
      in these two places. Results show that: (1) There are more female patients than 
      males in these two districts and most are imported cases, with an average age of 
      45 years. Medical measures were given in less than 3 days after symptoms 
      appeared. (2) The whole contact network of the two areas is disconnected. There 
      are a small number of transmission chains in the network. The average values of 
      degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank index are small. Few 
      patients have a relatively high contact number. There is no superspreader in the 
      network.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic changed expectations for information dissemination and use 
      around the globe, challenging accepted models of communications, leadership, and 
      social systems. We explore how social media discourse about COVID-19 in Italy was 
      affected by the rapid spread of the virus, and how themes in postings changed 
      with the adoption of social distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical 
      interventions (NPI). We used topic modeling and social network analysis to 
      highlight critical dimensions of conversations around COVID-19: 1) topics in 
      social media postings about the Coronavirus; 2) the scope and reach of social 
      networks; and 3) changes in social media content as the nation moved from partial 
      to full social distancing. Twitter messages sent in Italy between February 11th 
      and March 10th, 2020. 74,306 Tweets sent by institutions, news sources, elected 
      officials, scientists and social media influencers. Messages were retweeted more 
      than 1.2 million times globally. Non-parametric chi-square statistic with 
      residual analysis to identify categories, chi-square test for linear trend, and 
      Social Network Graphing. The first phase of the pandemic was dominated by social 
      media influencers, followed by a focus on the economic consequences of the virus 
      and placing blame on immigrants. As the crisis deepened, science-based themes 
      began to predominate, with a focus on reducing the spread of the virus through 
      physical distancing and business closures Our findings highlight the importance 
      of messaging in social media in gaining the public's trust and engagement during 
      a pandemic. This requires credible scientific voices to garner public support for 
      effective mitigation. Fighting the spread of an infectious disease goes hand in 
      hand with stemming the dissemination of lies, bad science, and misdirection.

TI  - Adolescent alcohol use: use of social network analysis and cross-classified 
      multilevel modeling to examine peer group, school, and neighborhood-level 
      influences.
PG  - 576-586
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2023.2222431 [doi]
AB  - Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an important role in 
      adolescent alcohol use behaviors. Methodological advances permit simultaneous 
      modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few 
      empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do typically: examine 
      each context separately; include contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for 
      clustering in the data; or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study 
      takes an eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual 
      contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary parameters of 
      interest are therefore variance rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather 
      than fixed effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how each 
      context may matter differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come 
      from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 
      females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and 
      cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and sex-disaggregated 
      samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups, schools, and neighborhoods 
      contributed 10.5%, 10.8%, and 0.4%, respectively, to total variation in 
      adolescent alcohol use. Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer 
      groups and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative to 
      neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings 
      have both methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can 
      model contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth 
      alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention strategies addressing 
      youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer networks.

      healthcare network analysis.
PG  - 453-459
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a serious public 
      health threat and spread rapidly between healthcare facilities (HCFs) during 
      interfacility patient movement. We examined patterns of transmission of CRE 
      associated with network clustering and positions during patient interfacility 
      transfer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Greater 
      Houston region ofTexas, , and social network analysis was performed by 
      constructing facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE surveillance 
      data. The network method (community detection algorithm) was used to detect 
      clustering patterns of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of 
      centrality and local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each 
      healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was 
      applied to test the association between network measures and facility-specific 
      incidence rate of CRE. RESULTS: A network of 268 healthcare facilities was 
      identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63% of 
      identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing CRE 
      occurred in 3 clusters, yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical 
      care abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted 
      rate ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that of 
      long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with another HCF 
      conferred a 3% (95% CI, 2%-4%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was predicted by the 
      healthcare network metrics. Increased surveillance and selective targeting of 
      high-risk facilities are warranted.

AB  - In 2015 the correlation between increasing numbers of cases of microcephaly and a 
      zika virus outbreak led to recognition of an epidemic of congenital zika virus 
      syndrome (CZVS), highlighting well-known weaknesses in health care measures. This 
      article examines the network of virtual information available on health service 
      provision for children suffering from CZVS in Rio de Janeiro. Using social media 
      analysis, data on information about services and care institutions were collected 
      from virtual sources using the Google search engine, so as to assess relations 
      among these actors in 2018. The results revealed a fragmented network centred on 
      virtual sources and secondary and tertiary public care services, with striking 
      proximity of press sources to public services. Also salient was the isolation of 
      private services and the lack of dialogue between philanthropic and public 
      services. Moreover, the information offered was found to be insufficient and 
      superficial, despite the gaps in the formal rehabilitation network. The evidence 
      thus suggested the importance of a well-established health care service network 
      and the necessity of fostering communication through virtual media.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An effective approach to containing epidemic outbreaks (e.g., 
      COVID-19) is targeted immunization, which involves identifying "super spreaders" 
      who play a key role in spreading disease over human contact networks. The 
      ultimate goal of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is to 
      minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with the famous influence 
      maximization problem studied in the field of social network analysis, whose 
      objective is to identify a group of influential individuals to maximize the 
      influence spread over social networks. This study aims to establish the 
      equivalence of the two problems and develop an effective methodology for targeted 
      immunization through the use of influence maximization. METHODS: We present a 
      concise formulation of the targeted immunization problem and show its equivalence 
      to the influence maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold 
      diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well as the targeted 
      immunization problem, can be solved by an optimization approach. A Benders' 
      decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem for 
      effective solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is conducted to 
      evaluate the performance and scalability of the optimization approach on 
      real-world large-scale networks. Computational results show that our proposed 
      approaches achieve more effective solutions compared to existing methods. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization and influence 
      maximization problems and present a concise formulation for the influence 
      maximization problem under the Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff 
      between computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is illustrated. 
      Our results suggest that the capability of determining the optimal group of 
      individuals for immunization is particularly crucial for the containment of 
      infectious disease outbreaks within a small network. Finally, our proposed 
      methodology not only determines the optimal solutions for target immunization, 
      but can also aid policymakers in determining the right level of immunization 
      coverage.

TI  - Shifting From Sectoral to Integrated Surveillance by Changing Collaborative 
      Practices: Application to West Nile Virus Surveillance in a Small Island State of 
      the Caribbean.
PG  - 649190

AB  - After spreading in the Americas, West Nile virus was detected in Guadeloupe 
      (French West Indies) for the first time in 2002. Ever since, several 
      organizations have conducted research, serological surveys, and surveillance 
      activities to detect the virus in horses, birds, mosquitoes, and humans. 
      Organizations often carried them out independently, leading to knowledge gaps 
      within the current virus' situation. Nearly 20 years after the first evidence of 
      West Nile virus in the archipelago, it has not yet been isolated, its impact on 
      human and animal populations is unknown, and its local epidemiological cycle is 
      still poorly understood. Within the framework of a pilot project started in 
      Guadeloupe in 2019, West Nile virus was chosen as a federative model to apply the 
      "One Health" approach for zoonotic epidemiological surveillance and shift from a 
      sectorial to an integrated surveillance system. Human, animal, and environmental 
      health actors involved in both research and surveillance were considered. 
      Semi-directed interviews and a Social Network Analysis were carried out to learn 
      about the surveillance network structure and actors, analyze information flows, 
      and identify communication challenges. An information system was developed to 
      fill major gaps: users' needs and main functionalities were defined through a 
      participatory process where actors also tested and validated the tool. 
      Additionally, all actors shared their data, which were digitized, cataloged, and 
      centralized, to be analyzed later. An R Shiny server was integrated into the 
      information system, allowing an accessible and dynamic display of data showcasing 
      all of the partners' information. Finally, a series of virtual workshops were 
      organized among actors to discuss preliminary results and plan the next steps to 
      improve West Nile Virus and vector-borne or emerging zoonosis surveillance. The 
      actors are willing to build a more resilient and cooperative network in 
      Guadeloupe with improved relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of their work.

TI  - Autonomy-supportive sexual health communication and sexual health behaviors for 
      black and Latino MSM in the House Ball Community: Protocol for a social network 
      analysis and exploratory structural equation model.
PG  - e0276350

AB  - BACKGROUND: Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest 
      risk of HIV of any group in the U.S. Prevalence could be even higher among Black 
      and Latino MSM belonging to the House Ball Community (HBC), an understudied 
      community comprised primarily of Black and Latino sexual and gender minorities, 
      with HIV prevalence from non-probability samples ranging from 4% to 38%. 
      OBJECTIVES: Basic Psychological Needs Theory will be utilized to understand how 
      sexual health communication (SHC) influences sexual health behaviors of HBC-MSM. 
      The proposed study will advance this goal by describing characteristics of SHC 
      embedded within social and sexual networks, and identifying the effects of SHC on 
      sexual health behaviors among a sample of Black and Latino HBC-MSM. METHODS: This 
      study entails cross-sectional quantitative survey design with internet-based data 
      collection to test a theory-driven model of the effects of autonomy supportive 
      communication on sexual health behaviors. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and 
      internet driven sampling (ID) will be used to recruit a sample of 200 HBC-MSM. We 
      will utilize egocentric network analysis to describe (a) the HBC-specific social 
      and/or sexual network members who provide SHC; (b) the degree of autonomy support 
      provided by network members, and (c) the sexual health behaviors characterizing 
      the sample of HBC-MSM. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be performed to 
      test associations between autonomy supportive sexual health communication 
      (independent variable) and sexual health behaviors (outcome), with needs 
      satisfaction and intrinsic motivation as intervening mediators. DISCUSSION: Such 
      knowledge is necessary to expand understanding of how SHC impacts sexual health 
      behaviors for HBC-MSM. The study provides an critical perspective on sexual 
      health behaviors and motivations as participants operate in HBC. Knowledge 
      generated from this study will help improve current HIV prevention interventions, 
      as well as inform the development of future interventions, tailored to HBC-MSM.

AB  - Despite the benefits of rural chickens in the Eastern Cape Province (ECP) of 
      South Africa, this sector is still underdeveloped and poorly surveyed for poultry 
      diseases. The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled 
      with communities and practices where the interactions between birds are high, 
      emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken diseases in the province. 
      However, to set up such a system requires knowledge of the value chain and trade 
      networks. Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value chain 
      analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify 
      biosecurity hotspots and an identification of barriers to market entry for rural 
      farmers was conducted. Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements 
      in the province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be targeted for 
      disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size 
      and influence within their ego networks. Traders and their transport vehicles 
      were identified as biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease 
      surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified three 
      municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) and Enoch Mgijima as 
      trade hubs where interaction between rural chickens occurs and resources can be 
      focused. The movement of spent hens from commercial operations that are 
      transported over long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships 
      were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the first study to 
      formally describe chicken trade networks within the province and the surrounding 
      region. Its findings provide a model for cost effective targeted surveillance in 
      the ECP and similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also provides 
      insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a possible contribution to 
      job creation and poverty alleviation once the barriers to market entry are 
      lifted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in poverty and 
      illness for people in vulnerable circumstances in ethnocultural communities. We 
      sought to understand the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on ethnocultural 
      communities to inform intersectoral advocacy and community action. METHODS: The 
      Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with cultural health 
      brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, 
      Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of 
      ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the 
      narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The 
      entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative 
      data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with 
      social network analysis. RESULTS: Brokers serving diverse communities collected 
      773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts 
      of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of 
      acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental 
      health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and 
      youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social 
      capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal 
      health and social system supports. INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has 
      illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among 
      vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of 
      COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation. Cultural brokering and 
      community social capital are key supports for people during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. These findings can inform policy to reduce harm and support community 
      resiliency.

TI  - Psychometric Validation of the Brief Alcohol Social Density Assessment in an 
      Adult Community Sample.
PG  - 212-218
LID - 10.1111/acer.14227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals' social networks exert a strong influence on alcohol use, 
      but valid assessment of network drinking behavior is typically lengthy and high 
      in participant burden. The aim of this study was to validate the Brief Alcohol 
      Social Density Assessment (BASDA), an efficient measure of perceived alcohol use 
      within a person's social network, in a sample of adult drinkers from the general 
      community. Specifically, the convergent, criterion-related, incremental validity 
      and internal validity were investigated by examining the BASDA in relation to 
      other established measures of drinking motives, weekly drinking level, and 
      severity of involvement. METHODS: Participants were 903 (56% female) adults who 
      reported drinking in the last year and who completed the BASDA, the Drinking 
      Motives Questionnaire, the Daily Drinking Questionnaire, and the Alcohol Use 
      Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). RESULTS: Significant positive correlations 
      were found between the BASDA and drinking motives, drinking quantity, and the 
      AUDIT (rs = 0.21 to 0.51, ps < 0.001), providing support for convergent validity. 
      There was a significantly higher BASDA score for those scoring at or above an 
      AUDIT cutoff for hazardous drinking (p < 0.001), providing support for 
      criterion-related validity. Finally, beyond motives and covariates, the BASDA was 
      significantly associated with total AUDIT score (ΔR(2)  = 0.09, p < 0.001), 
      indicating its additive contribution and providing support for incremental 
      validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed excellent fit, and all items 
      significantly loaded onto a single factor (p < 0.0001), providing evidence of 
      internal validity. The resulting alcohol social density latent variable was 
      significantly and robustly associated with drinks per week and AUDIT total score. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support for the BASDA as a valid and

TI  - Problematic Internet use among residential college students during the COVID-19 
      lockdown: A social network analysis approach.
PG  - 253-262
LID - 10.1556/2006.2021.00028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, problematic Internet use (PIU) 
      has become a serious issue among residential college students, who remain 
      physically isolated from off-campus society. This study constructs an integrated 
      model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control 
      (LOC) and objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n = 494) 
      were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the 
      World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer 
      effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured 
      using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit 
      regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. RESULTS: In 
      our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6%, and while internal LOC was a 
      protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer 
      environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting 
      roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor 
      when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became 
      a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of 
      betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further intervention studies focusing on individuals 
      with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally, 
      interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may enhance the 
      prevention of PIU.

TI  - Being Popular or Having Popular Friends, Which Is Better? A Longitudinal Social 
      Network Analysis of Depressive Symptoms among Chinese Adolescents under Major 
      Chronic Stress.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182111164 [doi]
LID - 11164
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found that adolescents' depressive symptoms are 
      influenced by social networks in a stressful context, especially focusing on the 
      processes of social selection and social influence. The current study aimed to 
      explore the coevolution of sociometric popularity and depressive symptoms among 
      adolescents suffering from the stress attached to the Chinese gaokao. METHODS: 
      The analytical sample comprised 1062 Chinese adolescents who were under 
      significant pressure to return to school for an additional year (returnees) to 
      prepare for college entrance examinations. Students were assessed for depressive 
      symptoms and asked to nominate up to five friends within their classes across 
      four waves (six months). We employed stochastic actor-oriented models to 
      investigate the interdependent relationships between popularity and depressive 
      symptoms. RESULTS: Adolescents' depressive symptoms negatively predicted future 
      friendship popularity in this stressful situation, but not vice versa. The 
      results of this study also highlighted the importance of friends' popularity, 
      indicating that adolescents who nominated popular peers as friends tended to 
      subsequently have lower depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested 
      that friends' popularity may serve as a protective factor against depressive 
      symptoms under major chronic stress. Network-based interventions may have 
      practical implications for reducing depressive symptoms under major chronic 
      stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, there have been many cases of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) among medical staff; however, the main factors associated with the 
      infection are not well understood. AIM: To identify the super-factors causing 
      COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study 
      was conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in which 
      front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of 
      patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data 
      between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social 
      network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between 
      influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all 
      participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a 
      medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; 
      betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working 
      was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the 
      network and had the strongest influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness 
      centrality: 0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected 
      group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree: 201; closeness: 
      28; betweenness centrality: 5.64). For family members, the exposure history to 
      Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two 
      isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the main factor that 
      prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection. The main factor 
      contributing to COVID-19 infections among medical staff was touching the cheek, 
      nose, and mouth while working.

AB  - Severe dengue outbreaks (DOs) affect the majority of Asian and Latin American 
      countries. Whether all DOs always occurred in sub-tropical and tropical areas 
      (STTA) has not been verified. We downloaded abstracts by searching keywords 
      "dengue (MeSH Major Topic)" from Pubmed Central since 1950, including three 
      collections: country names in abstracts (CNA), no abstracts (WA), and no country 
      names in abstracts (Non-CNA). Visualizations were created to present the DOs 
      across countries/areas in STTA. The percentages of mentioned country names and 
      authors' countries in STTA were computed on the CNA and Non-CNA bases. The social 
      network analysis was applied to highlight the most cited articles and countries. 
      We found that (1) three collections are 3427 (25.48%), 3137 (23.33%), and 6884 
      (51.19%) in CNA, WA, and Non-CNA, respectively; (2) the percentages of 94.3% and 
      79.9% were found in the CNA and Non-CNA groups; (3) the most mentioned country in 
      abstracts were India, Thailand, and Brazil; (4) most authors in the Non-CNA 
      collections were from the United States, Brazil, and China; (5) the most cited 
      article (PMID = 23563266) authored by Bhatt et al. had 2604 citations since 2013. 
      Our findings provide in-depth insights into the DO knowledge. The research 
      approaches are recommended for authors in research on other infectious diseases 
      in the future, not just limited to the DO topic.

TI  - Risk Communication in the Alert Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of News 
      Flow at National and Global Levels.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19159588 [doi]
LID - 9588
AB  - This study examined the global media citation network of COVID-19-related news at 
      two stages of the pandemic alert phase, i.e., the national level alert stage and 
      the global level alert stage. The findings reveal that the small-world pattern 
      and scale-free property of media citation networks contributed to the rapid 
      spread of COVID-19-related news around the world. Within the networks, a small 
      number of media outlets from a few countries formed the backbone of the network 
      to control the risk communication; meanwhile, many media of geographical and 
      cultural similarities formed cross-border collaborative cliques in the periphery 
      of the network. When the alert phase escalated from the national level to the 
      global level, the network demonstrated a number of changes. The findings 
      contribute to the understanding of risk communication for international public 
      health emergencies by taking into account the network perspective and 
      evolutionary nature of public health emergencies in analysis.

AB  - The Chinese Plan has provided an important model for the global fight against 
      COVID-19 since its outbreak. The present study describes the structural 
      characteristics of China's COVID-19 patent cooperation network at the province, 
      city, and applicant levels by using social network analysis based on data from 
      the Incopat global patent database since 2020, which helps to clarify the current 
      technology accumulation in this field in China, and provide patent information 
      support for the scientific efforts to fight against COVID-19. The findings are as 
      follows: First, the inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19 patent 
      cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to central to western 
      regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation level, kinship-based cooperation is 
      the strongest, business-based cooperation has the widest scope, while 
      proximity-based cooperation exists throughout these two main models of 
      cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core position in the 
      network, and play an important role in utilizing structural holes and bridging. 
      Patent applicants with high centrality are mostly firms. Research institutes and 
      universities mainly play the role of bridges. Third and lastly, there is no large 
      number of cliques at the province and city levels. However, there is a tendency 
      for cliques to develop at the applicant level. Hence, actions are needed to 
      prevent the development of information barriers.

TI  - Network Analysis of Internet Addiction Symptoms Among a Clinical Sample of 
      Japanese Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 2764-2772
LID - 10.1007/s10803-020-04714-x [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we employed network analysis that conceptualizes internet 
      addiction (IA) as a complex network of mutually influencing symptoms in 108 
      adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to examine the network 
      architecture of IA symptoms and identify central/influential symptoms. Our 
      analysis revealed that defensive and secretive behaviors and concealment of 
      internet use were identified as central symptoms in this population, suggesting 
      that mitigating these symptoms potentially prevent the development and/or 
      maintenance of IA in adolescents with ASD. Providing adolescents and their 
      caregivers with psychoeducation on the role of central symptoms above in IA can 
      be a salient intervention. Doing so may facilitate nonconflicting conversations 
      between them about adolescents' internet use and promote more healthy 
      adolescents' internet use behavior.

TI  - Association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health in older 
      adults: an analysis of data from the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging 
      Project.
PG  - e2023041

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The adverse health effects of individual-level social isolation 
      (e.g., perceived loneliness) have been well documented in older adults. However, 
      little is known about the impact of collective-level social isolation on health 
      outcomes. We sought to examine the association of group-level segregation with 
      cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults. METHODS: From the prospective Korean 
      Social Life, Health, and Aging Project database, we identified 528 
      community-dwelling older adults who were aged ≥60 years or were married to those 
      aged ≥60 years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups separate from 
      the major social group were defined as group-level-segregated. The CVH score was 
      calculated as the number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from 
      the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal logistic 
      regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations 
      between group-level segregation and CVH. RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean 
      age, 71.7 years; 60.0% female), 108 (20.5%) were segregated at baseline. In the 
      crosssectional analysis, group-level segregation was significantly associated 
      with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at baseline after adjusting for 
      socio-demographic factors and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.95). Among 274 participants who completed an 
      8-year follow-up, group-level segregation at baseline was marginally associated 
      with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24 
      to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse CVH. 
      These findings imply that the social network structure of a community may 
      influence its members' health status.

AB  - Shape Up Under 5 (SUU5) was a two-year early childhood obesity prevention pilot 
      study in Somerville, Massachusetts (2015-2017) designed to test a novel 
      conceptual framework called Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. For 
      whole-of-community interventions, this framework posits that diffusion of 
      stakeholders' knowledge about and engagement with childhood obesity prevention 
      efforts through their social networks will improve the implementation of 
      health-promoting policy and practice changes intended to reduce obesity risk. 
      SUU5 used systems science methods (agent-based modeling, group model building, 
      social network analysis) to design, facilitate, and evaluate the work of 16 
      multisector stakeholders ('the Committee'). In this paper, we describe the design 
      and methods of SUU5 using the conceptual framework: the approach to data 
      collection, and methods and rationale for study inputs, activities and 
      evaluation, which together may further our understanding of the hypothesized 
      processes within Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. We also present a 
      generalizable conceptual framework for addressing childhood obesity and similar 
      complex public health issues through whole-of-community interventions.

AB  - Animal movements represent a major risk for the spread of infectious diseases in 
      the domestic swine population. In this study, we adopted methods from social 
      network analysis to explore pig trades in Austria. We used a dataset of daily 
      records of swine movements covering the period 2015-2021. We analyzed the 
      topology of the network and its structural changes over time, including seasonal 
      and long-term variations in the pig production activities. Finally, we studied 
      the temporal dynamics of the network community structure. Our findings show that 
      the Austrian pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial farm 
      density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a scale-free topology but was 
      very sparse, suggesting a moderate impact of infectious disease outbreaks. 
      However, two regions (Upper Austria and Styria) may present a higher structural 
      vulnerability. The network also showed very high assortativity between holdings 
      from the same federal state. Dynamic community detection revealed a stable 
      behavior of the clusters. Yet trade communities did not correspond to 
      sub-national administrative divisions and may be an alternative zoning approach 
      to managing infectious diseases. Knowledge about the topology, contact patterns, 
      and temporal dynamics of the pig trade network can support optimized risk-based 
      disease control and surveillance strategies.

TI  - Complex Contact Network of Patients at the Beginning of an Epidemic Outbreak: An 
      Analysis Based on 1218 COVID-19 Cases in China.

AB  - The spread of viruses essentially occurs through the interaction and contact 
      between people, which is closely related to the network of interpersonal 
      relationships. Based on the epidemiological investigations of 1218 COVID-19 cases 
      in eight areas of China, we use text analysis, social network analysis and 
      visualization methods to construct a dynamic contact network of the epidemic. We 
      analyze the corresponding demographic characteristics, network indicators, and 
      structural characteristics of this network. We found that more than 65% of cases 
      are likely to be infected by a strong relationship, and nearly 40% of cases have 
      family members infected at the same time. The overall connectivity of the contact 
      network is low, but there are still some clustered infections. In terms of the 
      degree distribution, most cases' degrees are concentrated between 0 and 2, which 
      is relatively low, and only a few ones have a higher degree value. The degree 
      distribution also conforms to the power law distribution, indicating the network 
      is a scale-free network. There are 17 cases with a degree greater than 10, and 
      these cluster infections are usually caused by local transmission. The first 
      implication of this research is we find that the COVID-19 spread is closely 
      related to social structures by applying computational sociological methods for 
      infectious disease studies; the second implication is to confirm that text 
      analysis can quickly visualize the spread trajectory at the beginning of an 
      epidemic.

TI  - Development of an implementation and evaluation strategy for the Australian 'Zero 
      Childhood Cancer' (Zero) Program: a study protocol.
PG  - e034522
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034522 [doi]
LID - e034522
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effective implementation of a research Program requires an 
      actionable plan to guide execution. To assess the actionability and success of 
      that plan, both scientific and implementation elements must be taken into 
      account. The aim of this study is to assess the 'Zero Childhood Cancer 
      Personalised Medicine Program' (the Zero Program), an Australian first-ever and 
      most comprehensive personalised medicine programme for children with high-risk or 
      relapsed cancer, in terms of its structure, process and implementational effect. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will assess Program delivery mechanisms. The development 
      of the implementation and evaluation strategy will concentrate on the work of the 
      Zero Program as a complex whole. This includes the structure of collaborative 
      links across stakeholder groups involved in Program development and delivery, 
      changes to collaborative relationships over time and the impact of group working 
      on Program outcomes. We are applying a mixed-methods design including: a rapid 
      ethnography (observations of stakeholder interactions and informal 
      conversations), Program professionals' completion of a rapid health 
      implementation proforma and a social network analysis. Formative evaluations of 
      the implementation science effects, applying feedback techniques, for example, 
      Formative Evaluation Feedback Loops and the Zero Program professionals' feedback, 
      will determine where Program tailoring may be needed. A repeat of the social 
      network analysis downstream will examine network changes over time, followed by 
      an expert panel using the expert recommendations for implementing change to 
      assess the integration of implementation strategies into the Program structure. A 
      summative evaluation of the Program will bring the research elements together, 
      leading to comprehensive data triangulation and determining the sustainability 
      and implementational effects of Program delivery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      Ethical approval for this study has been granted by Hunter New England Research 
      Ethics Committee, New South Wales, Australia (approval ref: 2019/ETH12025). 
      Knowledge translation will be achieved through publications, reports and 
      conference presentations to healthcare professionals, patients, families and 
      researchers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03336931; Pre-results.

TI  - Prescribing Associated with High-Risk Opioid Exposures Among Non-cancer Chronic 
      Users of Opioid Analgesics: a Social Network Analysis.
PG  - 2443-2450
LID - 10.1007/s11606-019-05114-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The continued rise in fatalities from opioid analgesics despite a 
      steady decline in the number of individual prescriptions directing ≥ 90 morphine 
      milligram equivalents (MME)/day may be explained by patient exposures to 
      redundant prescriptions from multiple prescribers. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated 
      prescribers' specialty and social network characteristics associated with 
      high-risk opioid exposures resulting from single-prescriber high-daily dose 
      prescriptions or multi-prescriber discoordination. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of prescribers with opioid analgesic prescription 
      claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users in an Illinois Medicaid managed care 
      program in 2015-2016. MAIN MEASURES: Per prescriber rates of single-prescriber 
      high-daily-dose prescriptions or multi-prescriber discoordination. KEY RESULTS: 
      For 2280 beneficiaries, 36,798 opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 
      prescribers. Compared to 3% of prescriptions (involving 6% of prescribers and 7% 
      of beneficiaries) that directed ≥ 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a 
      greater share of high-risk exposures-13% of prescriptions (involving 23% of 
      prescribers and 24% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest 
      risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental 
      (incident rate ratio (95% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency 
      medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social 
      network analysis identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of 
      high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of 
      predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians. Using 
      multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected sociometric positions 
      were a risk factor for high-risk exposures. CONCLUSION: Low-volume prescribers in 
      the social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated 
      prescribing than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing 
      discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices 
      should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration of 
      Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to specialized 
      multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential policy implications.

TI  - Research on the evolution of the Chinese urban biomedicine innovation network 
      pattern: An analysis using multispatial scales.
PG  - 1036586
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.1036586 [doi]
LID - 1036586
AB  - This paper addresses the spatial pattern of urban biomedicine innovation networks 
      by separately using four scales, i.e., the national scale, interregional scale, 
      urban agglomeration scale, and provincial scale, on the basis of Chinese 
      biomedicine patent data from the incoPat global patent database (GPD) (2001-2020) 
      and using the method of social network analysis (SNA). Through the research, it 
      is found that (1) on the national scale, the Chinese biomedicine innovation 
      network becomes denser from west to the east as its complexity continuously 
      increases. Its spatial structure takes the form of a radial network pattern with 
      Beijing and Shanghai as its centers. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had an obvious 
      negative impact on this network at present. (2) On the interregional scale, the 
      strength of interregional network ties is greater than that of intraregional 
      network ties. The eastern, central and western biomedicine innovation networks 
      appear to be heterogeneous networks with regional central cities as the cores. 
      (3) At the urban agglomeration scale, the strength of intraurban-agglomeration 
      network ties is greater than that of interurban-agglomeration network ties. The 
      three major urban agglomerations have formed radial spatial patterns with central 
      cities as the hubs. (4) At the provincial scale, the intraprovincial networks 
      have poor connectivity and low internal ties strength, which manifest as 
      core-periphery structures with the provincial capitals as centers. Our research 
      conclusion helps to clarify the current accumulation of technology and offer 
      guidance for the development of China's biomedicine industry.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected China's macroeconomy, industrial 
      transformation, and high-quality development. Research on economic patterns and 
      urban network systems can provide a reference for healthy development of the 
      regional economic system. The evolution of the economic pattern and urban network 
      system of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2010 to 2020 is 
      investigated using methods (e.g., the gravity center model, the gravitational 
      force model, social network analysis, and geographic information system). (1) The 
      gravity center of gross domestic product (GDP) of the GBA is located in Nansha 
      district, Guangzhou, with a skewing direction northwest-east-northwest and a 
      movement rate of "large-small-large." The center of import and export and the 
      center of consumption show a "zigzagging migration" in which the center of 
      investment shows an "irregular (random) migration". (2) The economic connection 
      degree of cities in the GBA exhibits a high ascending velocity, and the whole 
      area tends to be mature, with a significant effect of spatial proximity. With the 
      steady increase in network density, there is significant polarization of network 
      centrality in the region. The four major cohesive subgroups have been relatively 
      stable and consistent with the degree of geographic proximity of the cities. The 
      center-periphery structure is more significant, in which the core area is 
      extended to the cities on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary, thus forming 
      the core cluster of "Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Dongguan." In this study, the 
      evolution of economic patterns and urban network systems in the GBA over the past 
      decade is analyzed using multiple methods (i.e., gravity model, urban network 
      system analysis, and geographic information system) based on urban socioeconomic 
      data by starting from various spatial elements (e.g., "points, lines, and 
      networks") to gain insights into and optimize research on regional economic 
      development after the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Unravelling direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms in France and 
      their association with the 2016-2017 epidemic of Highly Pathogenic Avian 
      Influenza (H5N8).

AB  - Live animal movements generate direct contacts (via the exchange of live animals) 
      and indirect contacts (via the transit of transport vehicles) between farms, 
      which can contribute to the spread of pathogens. However, most analyses focus 
      solely on direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution of 
      live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases. Here, we used French 
      live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one of the largest transport companies 
      to compare direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate 
      how these patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of highly 
      pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614 farms were included in the 
      study, and two directed networks were generated: the animal introduction network 
      (exchange of live ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles). 
      Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were scrutinized in relation 
      to farm infection status during the epidemic. Results showed that farms were 
      substantially more connected in the transit network than in the animal 
      introduction network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more 
      opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals. We also showed 
      that animal introduction and transit networks' statistics decreased substantially 
      during the epidemic (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods 
      (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a probability of 33.3 % 
      that a farm exposed to the infection through either of the two live duck movement 
      networks (i.e. that was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was 
      reported as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within seven 
      days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that the level of exposure 
      of farms by these two contact patterns was low, leading only to a handful of 
      transmission events through these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live 
      animal movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but have been 
      efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the French 2020-2021 epidemic. 
      These results underpin the relevance of studying indirect contacts resulting from 
      the movement of animals to understand their transmission potential and the 
      importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease control 
      strategies.

AB  - AIM: To study the existence of subgroups by exploring the similarities between 
      the attributes of the nodes of the groups, in relation to diet and gender and, to 
      analyse the connectivity between groups based on aspects of similarities between 
      them through SNA and artificial intelligence techniques. METHODS: 235 students 
      from 5 different educational centres participate in this study between March and 
      December 2015. Data analysis carried out is divided into two blocks: social 
      network analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social 
      network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find the best number 
      of cohesive groups within each of the friendship networks of the different 
      classes analysed. RESULTS: After applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the 
      best division into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom B 
      and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences between the groups and 
      the gender and diet variables. After applying K-means using population diet as an 
      input variable, a K-means clustering of 2 clusters for class A, 3 clusters for 
      class B and 3 clusters for class C is obtained. CONCLUSION: Adolescents form 
      subgroups within their classrooms. Subgroup cohesion is defined by the fact that 
      nodes share similarities in aspects that influence obesity, they share attributes 
      related to food quality and gender. The concept of homophily, related to SNA, 
      justifies our results. Artificial intelligence techniques together with the 
      application of the Girvan-Newman provide robustness to the structural analysis of 
      similarities and cohesion between subgroups.

TI  - A stakeholder analysis of community-led collaboration to reduce health inequity 
      in a deprived neighbourhood in South Korea.
PG  - 35-44
LID - 10.1177/1757975918791517 [doi]
AB  - Intersectoral collaboration amongst health and other sectors, as well as between 
      government and non-governmental organisations, has been highlighted as a way to 
      improve health equity. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess collaborative 
      relationships between multiple government sectors and civil society and to 
      suggest possible health promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the 
      urban poor in deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in 
      health promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city 
      area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods. Participants 
      included stakeholders working for or engaging in governments (3), public health 
      care institutions (5), social service providers (3), community-based 
      organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based organisations (3). We conducted 
      semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and then collected survey data. 
      Quantitative data were analysed using social network analysis, and qualitative 
      data were analysed through iterative and consensus processes. The social network 
      analysis indicated that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and 
      controlling informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis 
      showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of 
      collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to challenges to 
      intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and communication, (2) 
      need of a coalition with a committed leading actor for future collaboration and 
      (3) organisational and political silos within and across public sectors. 
      Increased understanding of the current status of and challenges to collaboration 
      can inform the planning and implementation of complex intervening strategies and 
      policies tailored to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods. Community-led 
      collaborative actions empower people in marginalised communities to envision a 
      healthier community.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine equity and health equity conversations on Twitter.
PG  - 997-1006
AB  - This study used social network analysis and trending hashtags on Twitter to 
      identify trends related to health and vaccine equity during the Omicron wave. The 
      analysis was conducted using consumer-friendly platforms/tools such as the 
      Healthcare Hashtag Project and NodeXL. The study found that during the Omicron 
      wave, there was a higher volume of tweets related to the more specific hashtag 
      #VaccineEquity, as compared to the more general topic of #HealthEquity. The study 
      also identified the top influencers for these hashtags and how they changed over 
      time. The study proposes a combination of existing tools and approaches, 
      including ontological surveillance and social network analysis, to develop 
      proactive strategies that respond to public opinion in a timely manner. Social 
      network analysis tools could also be useful for healthcare organizations and 
      providers in training their staff involved in social media management to develop 
      better social media communication strategies.

TI  - The Role of Location in the Spread of SARS-CoV-2: Examination of Cases and 
      Exposed Contacts in South Texas, Using Social Network Analysis.
PG  - e516
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2023.189 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to better understand the types of locations that 
      serve as hubs for the transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: Contact tracers 
      interviewed individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 
      and March 2021, as well as the people with whom those individuals had contact. We 
      conducted a 2-mode social network analysis of people by the types of places they 
      visited, focusing on the forms of centrality exhibited by place types. RESULTS: 
      The most exposed locations were grocery stores, commercial stores, restaurants, 
      commercial services, and schools. These types of locations also have the highest 
      "betweenness," meaning that they tend to serve as hubs between other kinds of 
      locations since people would usually visit more than 1 location in a day or when 
      infected. The highest pairs of locations were grocery store/retail store, 
      restaurant/retail store, and restaurant/grocery store. Schools are not at the top 
      but are 3 times in the top 7 pairs of locations and connected to the 3 types of 
      locations in those top pairs. CONCLUSIONS: As the pandemic progressed, location 
      hotspots shifted between businesses, schools, and homes. In this social network 
      analysis, certain types of locations appeared to be potential hubs of 
      transmission.

TI  - Causal Attributions in Breast Cancer Patients Planning to Undergo Adjuvant 
      Endocrine Therapy.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115931 [doi]
LID - 5931
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore causal attributions among Korean breast 
      cancer patients who were planning to undergo adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) as 
      well as the relationships between patient demographic and clinical 
      characteristics and their causal attributions. Causal attributions were assessed 
      with an open-ended response item, which asked patients to list what they thought 
      were the three most important causal factors of their illness. The relationships 
      between patient characteristics and causal attributions were determined through 
      univariate analysis, and the relationships between causal attributions were 
      obtained using social network analysis. A total of 299 participants provided 707 
      responses. Stress, diet, and exercise were believed to be the three most likely 
      causes of breast cancer. There were no significant differences between causal 
      attributions and the age, education level, marital status, or cancer stage of 
      patients. However, there were differences in the associations between 
      personality, genetics, and reproductive history and patient-identified causal 
      attributions according to the patients' family history of cancer. Patients with a 
      family history of cancer were more likely to believe that personality and 
      genetics/family history were causes of breast cancer compared to patients without 
      such a history. Therefore, it is necessary to educate patients to perceive stress 
      and lifestyle-related factors as modifiable causal factors in order to have a 
      positive effect on their adherence to AET.

TI  - Role of Live-Duck Movement Networks in Transmission of Avian Influenza, France, 
      2016-2017.
PG  - 472-480
LID - 10.3201/eid2603.190412 [doi]
AB  - The relative roles that movement and proximity networks play in the spread of 
      highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are often unknown during an 
      epidemic, preventing effective control. We used network analysis to explore the 
      devastating epidemic of HPAI A(H5N8) among poultry, in particular ducks, in 
      France during 2016-2017 and to estimate the likely contribution of live-duck 
      movements. Approximately 0.2% of live-duck movements could have been responsible 
      for between-farm transmission events, mostly early during the epidemic. Results 
      also suggest a transmission risk of 35.5% when an infected holding moves flocks 
      to another holding within 14 days before detection. Finally, we found that 
      densely connected groups of holdings with sparse connections between groups 
      overlapped farmer organizations, which represents important knowledge for 
      surveillance design. This study highlights the importance of movement bans in 
      zones affected by HPAI and of understanding transmission routes to develop 
      appropriate HPAI control strategies.

TI  - The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via staff work and household 
      networks in residential aged-care services in Victoria, Australia, May-October 
      2020.
PG  - 1334-1341
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.243 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have 
      been significant among elderly residents of residential aged-care services 
      (RACS). To prevent incursions of COVID-19 in RACS in Australia, visitors were 
      banned and aged-care workers were encouraged to work at a single site. We 
      conducted a review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand how 
      workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe acute respiratory 
      coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS. DESIGN: Retrospective outbreak 
      review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in 
      Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020. METHODS: The Victorian Department of 
      Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social 
      networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a household 
      network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index cases were reviewed 
      to estimate the number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of 
      outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission via households. 
      RESULTS: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak as staff, 91 (4.5%) were 
      multisite staff cases. Forty-three outbreaks were attributed to multisite work 
      and 35 were deemed potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In 
      addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak through their 
      household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were attributed to staff-household 
      transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting worker mobility through single-site policies 
      could reduce the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS to another. 
      However, initiatives that reduce the chance of transmission via household 
      networks would also be needed.

      countries to the Zika virus outbreak.
PG  - 530
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-6842-x [doi]
LID - 530
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent Zika virus (ZIKAV) epidemics disclosed a major public 
      health threat and a scientific and technological (S&T) challenge. The lessons 
      learned from the S&T response of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries 
      are critical to inform further research and guide scientific investments. The 
      present study aimed to assess how new S&T knowledge produced and disseminated 
      regionally can contribute to address global health challenges. METHODS: 
      Scientometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC 
      scientific contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to 
      December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of Science, 
      Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles were obtained from 
      SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and LILACS (Literature in the 
      Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries 
      were retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each 
      database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase 
      from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20% of all publications and Brazil 
      was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV 
      research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were 
      retrieved. Only 5% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The 
      largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the 
      ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focus of 
      patents. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's 
      research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in 
      generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries 
      have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) 
      the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge 
      sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single 
      LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and 
      low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary 
      approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control 
      future outbreaks.

TI  - Density or Connectivity: What Are the Main Causes of the Spatial Proliferation of 
      COVID-19 in Korea?
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105084 [doi]
LID - 5084
AB  - COVID-19 has sparked a debate on the vulnerability of densely populated cities. 
      Some studies argue that high-density urban centers are more vulnerable to 
      infectious diseases due to a higher chance of infection in crowded urban 
      environments. Other studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than 
      population density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19. While 
      several studies have examined the role of urban density and connectivity in 
      Europe and the U.S., few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. This 
      study aims to investigate the role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by 
      comparing different measures of urban density and connectivity during the first 
      eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of density were derived from 
      the Korean census, and four measures of connectivity were computed using social 
      network analysis of the Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport 
      Database. We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of 
      confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county level, 
      collected individually from regional government websites in Korea. Results show 
      that both density and connectivity play an important role in the proliferation of 
      the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure, 
      particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better indicator of COVID-19 
      proliferation than the density measures. Our findings imply that policies that 
      take into account different types of connectivity between cities might be 
      necessary to contain the outbreak in the early phase.

TI  - HIV transmission network analysis allows identifying unreported risk factors in 
      HIV-positive blood donors in France.
PG  - 1191-1201
LID - 10.1111/trf.16290 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As sex between men is a major route of human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) infection in most western countries, restrictive deferral rules for blood 
      donation have largely been implemented regarding men having sex with men (MSM). 
      Here, we sought here to assign unreported HIV risk factors in blood donors (BDs) 
      and reevaluated the MSM-associated fraction of HIV transfusion residual risk 
      (%RR(MSM) ). METHODS: We applied a genetic distance-based approach to infer an 
      HIV transmission network for 384 HIV sequences from French BDs and 1337 HIV 
      sequences from individuals with known risk factors (ANRS PRIMO primary HIV 
      infection cohort). We validated the possibility of assigning a risk factor 
      according to clustering using assortative mixing. Finally, we recalculated the 
      %RR(MSM) . RESULTS: A total of 81 of 284 (28.5%) male and 5 of 100 (5%) female 
      BDs belonged to a cluster; 72 (88.9%) of the 81 male BDs belonged to MSM 
      clusters. After cluster correction, 8 of 67 (11.9%), 4 of 21 (19.0%), and 19 of 
      88 (21.6%) HIV-positive (HIV+) male BDs with heterosexual, other, or unknown risk 
      factors could be reclassified as MSM, accounting for 10.9% of the total HIV+ male 
      BDs. Overall, 139 of 284 HIV+ male donors (48.9%) could be considered MSM between 
      2000 and 2016 in France. Between 2005 and 2016, the %RR(MSM) increase varied from 
      0 to 19%, without differing significantly from the %RR(MSM) before 
      reclassification. CONCLUSION: Network inference can be used to complement 
      declaration data on risk factors for HIV infection in BDs. This approach, 
      complementary to behavioral studies, is a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of 
      changes in deferral criteria on BD compliance.

TI  - Latent Profile Patterns of Network-Level Norms and Associations with 
      Individual-Level Sexual Behaviors: The N2 Cohort Study in Chicago.
PG  - 2355-2372
LID - 10.1007/s10508-023-02555-0 [doi]
AB  - Individual-level behavior can be influenced by injunctive and descriptive social 
      network norms surrounding that behavior. There is a need to understand how the 
      influence of social norms within an individual's social networks may influence 
      individual-level sexual behavior. We aimed to typologize the network-level norms 
      of sexual behaviors within the social networks of Black sexual and gender 
      minoritized groups (SGM) assigned male at birth. Survey data were collected in 
      Chicago, Illinois, USA, between 2018 and 2019 from Black SGM. A total of 371 
      participants provided individual-level information about sociodemographic 
      characteristics and HIV vulnerability from sex (i.e., condomless sex, group sex, 
      use of alcohol/drugs to enhance sex) and completed an egocentric network 
      inventory assessing perceptions of their social network members' (alters') 
      injunctive and descriptive norms surrounding sexual behaviors with increased HIV 
      vulnerability. We used Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify network-level 
      norms based on the proportion of alters' approval of the participant engaging in 
      condomless sex, group sex, and use of drugs to enhance sex (i.e., injunctive 
      norms) and alters' engagement in these behaviors (i.e., descriptive norms). We 
      then used binomial regression analyses to examine associations between 
      network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV vulnerability from sex. The 
      results of our LPA indicated that our sample experienced five distinct latent 
      profiles of network-level norms: (1) low HIV vulnerability network norm, (2) 
      moderately high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability 
      network norm, (4) condomless sex dominant network norm, and (5) approval of drug 
      use during sex dominant network norm. Condomless anal sex, group sex, and using 
      drugs to enhance sex were positively and significantly associated with higher HIV 
      vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV vulnerability 
      norm profiles. To mitigate Black SGM's HIV vulnerability, future HIV risk 
      reduction strategies can consider using network-level intervention approaches 
      such as opinion leaders, segmentation, induction, or alteration, through an 
      intersectionality framework.

TI  - Identifying target areas for risk-based surveillance and control of transboundary 
      animal diseases: a seasonal analysis of slaughter and live-trade cattle movements 
      in Uganda.
PG  - 18619
LID - 10.1038/s41598-023-44518-4 [doi]
LID - 18619
AB  - Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary Animal 
      Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would otherwise be 
      isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals 
      to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network 
      structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features 
      that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and 
      intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 
      between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the 
      purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the 
      network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade 
      can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal 
      variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high 
      heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These 
      observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited 
      to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral 
      areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, 
      reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features 
      were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly 
      slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, 
      analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique 
      framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth 
      disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to 
      inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making 
      on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement 
      and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal 
      health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of 
      outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.

AB  - Historical trauma and rapid cultural change contribute to a high burden of stress 
      in Alaska Native communities. The goal of the Yup'ik Experiences of Stress and 
      Coping Project was to better understand stress and coping in Yup'ik communities 
      and the role of cultural values and practices in coping. Sixty Yup'ik adults aged 
      18-84 years took part in semistructured interviews. They discussed how they coped 
      with salient stressful experiences and shared the things that bought them hope 
      and peace. Interview themes were identified and inter-relationships between 
      themes were explored through social network analysis. Participants discussed the 
      importance of cultural traditions in coping, including subsistence, dancing and 
      drumming, intergenerational transmission of knowledge, and reflective awareness 
      of interconnections with others. Participants found strength in family 
      relationships, spirituality, helping others, and coming together as a community. 
      Three coping clusters emerged: Ilaliurucaraq (be welcoming) involved opening 
      one's frame of mind and building connections; Yuuyaraq (Yup'ik way of life) 
      focused on Yup'ik traditions and values; and Assircaarturluni Yuuyaraq (try to 
      live a better life) involved healing from historical trauma. Findings illustrate 
      the resilience and evolving strengths of rural Yup'ik communities facing a 
      continually changing cultural landscape and provide information for developing 
      community-driven culturally based interventions.

TI  - The relationship between cryptomarket drug purchase, social networks and adverse 
      drug events: A cross-sectional study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug use and trading are typically social activities; however, 
      supply through cryptomarkets can occur without any in-person social contact. 
      People who use drugs alone may be at higher risk of experiencing harms, for 
      example, due to lack of others who may call for emergency assistance. 
      Alternatively, cryptomarkets may be a source of harm reduction information and 
      drugs with better-known content and dose, potentially reducing the risk of 
      adverse events. This study examines relationships between cryptomarket use, 
      drug-using social networks and adverse drug events for MDMA, cocaine and LSD. 
      METHOD: A subsample of 23,053 respondents from over 70 countries was collected in 
      the 2018 Global Drug Survey. People who reported using MDMA, cocaine or LSD were 
      asked about using cryptomarkets to purchase these drugs; any adverse drug events 
      requiring medical treatment (combining seeking treatment and should have sought 
      treatment but did not); and social networks who they had used the specific drug 
      with. All measures referred to the last 12 months, hereon referred to as 
      'recent'. Binary logistic regressions examined relationships between cryptomarket 
      use, drug-using social networks, and adverse drug events, controlling for age, 
      gender, and frequency of drug use. RESULTS: Adverse events from any drug type 
      were low (5.2%) and for each drug; MDMA (3.5%); cocaine (3.3%); and LSD (3.5%). 
      After controlling for covariates, recent cryptomarket use was associated with 
      increased likelihood of having no drug-using network for each drug type. People 
      who recently used cryptomarkets were more likely to report adverse cocaine 
      (AOR = 1.70 (1.22-2.37)) and LSD (AOR = 1.58 (1.12-2.09)) events. For those 
      reporting a network size >1, network characteristics did not differ with recent 
      cryptomarket use; however, those reporting recent cryptomarket use were more 
      likely to report adverse LSD events (AOR = 1.86 (0.99-3.51)). CONCLUSION: People 
      who reported purchasing drugs from cryptomarkets more commonly reported having no 
      drug-using network, and cryptomarket purchase was associated with reported 
      adverse events. Our results support the notion that cryptomarket use increases 
      drug-related harm, but further disentanglement of multiple complex mechanisms is 
      needed in future research.

TI  - The pig transport network in Switzerland: Structure, patterns, and implications 
      for the transmission of infectious diseases between animal holdings.
PG  - e0217974

LID - e0217974
AB  - The topology of animal transport networks contributes substantially to how fast 
      and to what extent a disease can transmit between animal holdings. Therefore, 
      public authorities in many countries mandate livestock holdings to report all 
      movements of animals. However, the reported data often does not contain 
      information about the exact sequence of transports, making it impossible to 
      assess the effect of truck sharing and truck contamination on disease 
      transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig 
      transport network by means of social network analysis and to assess the 
      implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In particular, we 
      studied how additional information about transport sequences changes the topology 
      of the contact network. The study is based on the official animal movement 
      database in Switzerland and a sample of transport data from one transport 
      company. The results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly 
      fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease outbreak. By 
      considering the time sequence of transports, we found that even in the worst 
      case, only 0.34% of all farm-pairs were connected within one month. However, both 
      network connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if truck 
      sharing and especially truck contamination were considered. Therefore, the extent 
      to which a disease may be transmitted between animal holdings may be 
      underestimated if we only consider data from the official animal movement 
      database. Our results highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts 
      between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck sharing and 
      contamination. As the nature of animal transport networks is inherently temporal, 
      we strongly suggest the use of temporal network measures in order to evaluate 
      individual and overall risk of disease transmission through animal 
      transportation.

AB  - Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of 
      pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global 
      human movement, and initial lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and 
      contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be 
      explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding 
      return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming 
      research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology 
      and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model 
      describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, 
      via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent 
      strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial 
      contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show 
      that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) 
      could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, 
      potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce 
      contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact 
      behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen 
      spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.

TI  - A holistic AI-based approach for pharmacovigilance optimization from patients 
      behavior on social media.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-based pharmacovigilance optimization 
      approach using patient's social media data. Instead of focusing on the detection 
      and identification of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) in social media posts in single 
      time points, we propose a holistic approach that looks at the evolution of 
      different user behavior indicators in time. We examine various NLP-based 
      indicators such as word frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions 
      mentions, and sentiment analysis. We introduce a classification approach to 
      identify normal vs. abnormal time periods based on patient comments. This 
      approach, along with user behavior indicators, can optimize the pharmacovigilance 
      process by flagging the need for immediate attention and further investigation. 
      We specifically focus on the Levothyrox® case in France, which sparked media 
      attention due to changes in the medication formula and affected patient behavior 
      on medical forums. For classification, we propose a deep learning architecture 
      called Word Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN), trained on word clouds 
      from patient comments. We evaluate different temporal resolutions and NLP 
      pre-processing techniques, finding that monthly resolution and the proposed 
      indicators can effectively detect new safety signals, with an accuracy of 75%. We 
      have made the code open source, available via github.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to understand the information architecture and degree of 
      integration of mortality surveillance systems in Ghana and Peru. Methods: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional study using a combination of document review and 
      unstructured interviews to describe and analyse the sub-systems collecting 
      mortality data. Results: We identified 18 and 16 information subsystems with 
      independent databases capturing death events in Peru and Ghana respectively. The 
      mortality information architecture was highly fragmented with a multiplicity of 
      unconnected data silos and with formal and informal data collection systems. 
      Conclusion: Reliable and timely information about who dies where and from what 
      underlying cause is essential to reporting progress on Sustainable Development 
      Goals, ensuring policies are responding to population health dynamics, and 
      understanding the impact of threats and events like the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Integrating systems hosted in different parts of government remains a challenge 
      for countries and limits the ability of statistics systems to produce accurate 
      and timely information. Our study exposes multiple opportunities to improve the 
      design of mortality surveillance systems by integrating existing subsystems 
      currently operating in silos.

TI  - The Impact of Cooperative Behavior between Social Organizations during the 
      COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in Shanghai: A Simulation Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20021409 [doi]
LID - 1409
AB  - In 2022, a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created considerable challenges 
      for the Shanghai public health system. However, conventional prevention and 
      control strategies, which only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently 
      decrease the number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode is 
      needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a stochastic 
      actor-oriented model (SAOM) to analyze how these social organizations cooperate 
      with others and further identify the mechanism that drives them to create a 
      reliable and sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of 
      social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of the 
      actor’s attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative behavior in 
      RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220 participants in 19 social 
      organizations. The results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships 
      increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the network between 
      social organizations became more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in 
      four sub-models were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and 
      e/s > 2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a 
      positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all except 
      the “same age group effect (−1.02)”. The results also indicated that the social 
      organizations tend to build relationships with more active actors in the 
      community in every time period. This paper is of great significance regarding the 
      innovation of public health system management and the improvement of Chinese 
      grassroots governance.

TI  - Identifying critical gaps in research to advance global surgery by 2030: a 
      systematic mapping review.

AB  - Progress on surgical system strengthening has been slow due to a disconnect 
      between evidence generation and the information required for effective 
      policymaking. This systematic mapping review sought to assess critical research 
      gaps in the field of global surgery guided by the World Health Organisation 
      Health Systems building block framework, analysis of authorship and funding 
      patterns, and an exploration of emerging research partnership networks. 
      Literature was systematically mapped to identify, screen, and synthesize results 
      of publications in the global surgery field between 2015 and March 2022. We 
      searched four databases and included literature published in seven languages. A 
      social network analysis determined the network attributes of research 
      institutions and their transient relationships in shaping the global surgery 
      research agenda. We identified 2,298 relevant studies out of 92,720 unique 
      articles searched. Research output increased from 453 in 2015-16 to 552 in 
      2021-22, largely due to literature on Covid-19 impacts on surgery. Sub-Saharan 
      Africa (792/2298) and South Asia (331/2298) were the most studied regions, 
      although high-income countries represented a disproportionate number of first 
      (42%) and last (43%) authors. Service delivery received the most attention, 
      including the surgical burden and quality and safety of services, followed by 
      capacity-building efforts in low- and middle-income countries. Critical research 
      in economics and financing, essential infrastructure and supplies, and surgical 
      leadership necessary to guide policy decisions at the country level were lacking. 
      Global surgical systems remain largely under-researched. Knowledge diffusion 
      requires an emphasis on developing sustainable research partnerships and capacity 
      across low- and middle-income countries. A renewed focus must be given to 
      equipping countries with tools for effective decision-making to enhance 
      investments in high-quality surgical services.

TI  - The Dynamics of Cross-Sector Collaboration in Centralized Disaster Governance: A 
      Network Study of Interorganizational Collaborations during the MERS Epidemic in 
      South Korea.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19010018 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - The debate continues as to which governance structure is most appropriate for 
      collaborative disaster response, particularly between centralization and 
      decentralization. This article aims to contribute to this debate by analyzing the 
      structural characteristics of a multisectoral network that emerged and evolved 
      under strong state control during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome-coronavirus (MERS) in South Korea. This study particularly focuses on 
      the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The 
      data for the study were collected through a content analysis of government 
      documents and news articles. Using social network analysis, the authors found 
      that the network evolved into a centralized structure around a small number of 
      governmental organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between 
      participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network displayed a 
      preponderance of internal ties both among health and non-health organizations and 
      among public and nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences 
      of structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak 
      period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the centralization of 
      disaster management may not or only marginally be conducive to cross-sector 
      collaboration during public health disasters, calling for a careful design of 
      governance structures for disaster response.

TI  - Papás Activos: Associations between Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior and 
      Personal Networks among Fathers Living in Texas Colonias.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17249243 [doi]
LID - 9243
AB  - Despite growing health disparities in Latino populations related to lack of 
      physical activity (PA), little is known regarding the impact of social networks 
      on PA and sedentary behavior among a sample of Latino fathers residing in 
      functionally rural colonias. Fathers wore accelerometers and responded to 
      questions regarding their self-efficacy and characteristics of who they were 
      active with most often. Fathers (n = 47) attained a mean of 73.3 min of 
      moderate-to-vigorous PA (SD = 23.8) per day and were sedentary for a mean of 
      364.0 min (SD = 74.4) per day. In total, fathers reported 205 alters and 
      significantly more family members (M = 3.60, SD = 1.64) than friends (M = 0.77, 
      SD = 1.37). Sedentary time was positively associated with number of peers and 
      inversely related to the number of children reported. Minutes of 
      moderate-to-vigorous PA was significantly associated with greater self-efficacy 
      and number of family members reported. This study contributes to the evidence by 
      further examining PA correlates of Latino fathers from functionally rural colonia 
      communities. Additionally, this study supported both family systems theory and 
      the socio-ecological model as it details the interpersonal and familial 
      influences of PA behavior. Thus, supports for family activity promotion and 
      programs which impact familial norms and activity at the family level may be 
      particularly useful.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the movement patterns of post-larvae (PL) of whiteleg 
      shrimp and black tiger shrimp, which were linked to the epidemic of acute 
      hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in Thailand in 2013, using social 
      network analysis. Hatcheries or nurseries were assigned as origin nodes, whereas 
      cultivated ponds were designated as destination nodes. From 376 farms, data of 
      1300 ponds were collected from network data using a questionnaire. We found that 
      1477 nodes with 1315 ties appeared in this study. These were divided into a 
      network of cases and controls that presented 538 nodes with 436 ties and 1013 
      nodes with 879 ties, respectively. The top four out-degree centrality values in 
      the entire partial network, cases, and controls were used to analyze ego-alter 
      similarity. The results showed that each PL provider played a different role in 
      the association with the disease sender. A simulated network using exponential 
      random graph models presented edges as a significant microstructure. In addition, 
      our analysis indicated that the hatchery or nursery (PL provider) is an important 
      node for AHPND occurrence. In conclusion, this study led us to understand the 
      source of PL, which plays a key role in the surveillance, prevention, and control 
      of AHPND.

LID - 1644
AB  - This work studies the health status of two populations similar in most social and 
      environmental interactions but one: the individuals from one population are 
      victims of an internal armed conflict. Both populations are located in the 
      Risaralda province, Colombia and the data for this study results from a 
      combination of administrative records from the health system, between 2011 and 
      2016. We implemented a methodology based on graph theory that defines the system 
      as a set of heterogeneous social actors, including individuals as well as 
      organizations, embedded in a biological environment. The model of analysis uses 
      the diagnoses in medical records to detect morbidity and mortality patterns for 
      each individual (ego-networks), and assumes that these patterns contain relevant 
      information about the effects of the actions of social actors, in a given 
      environment, on the status of health. The analysis of the diagnoses and causes of 
      specific mortality, following the Social Network Analysis framework, shows 
      similar morbidity and mortality rates for both populations. However, the 
      diagnoses' patterns show that victims portray broader interactions between 
      diagnoses, including mental and behavioral disorders, due to the hardships of 
      this population.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the dynamics of sentiment polarisation in the 
      active online discussion communities formed around a controversial 
      topic-immigration. Using a collection of tweets in the Swedish language from 2012 
      to 2019, we track the development of the communities and their sentiment 
      polarisation trajectories over time and in the context of an exogenous shock 
      represented by the European refugee crisis in 2015. To achieve the goal of the 
      study, we apply methods of network and sentiment analysis to map users' 
      interactions in the network communities and quantify users' sentiment polarities. 
      The results of the analysis give little evidence for users' polarisation in the 
      network and its communities, as well as suggest that the crisis had a limited 
      effect on the polarisation dynamics on this social media platform. Yet, we notice 
      a shift towards more negative tonality of users' sentiments after the crisis and 
      discuss possible explanations for the above-mentioned observations.

TI  - The Intersection of Age and HIV Status for Black Sexual Minority Men (BSMM): A 
      Social Network Analysis.
PG  - 238-244
LID - 10.1007/s10461-023-04127-8 [doi]
AB  - Advancements in treatment have resulted in increased life expectancy for 
      individuals living with HIV. However, there is a dearth of literature focused on 
      the intersection of age and HIV status, particularly for older Black sexual 
      minority men (SMM) who are disproportionately impacted by HIV. This study aimed 
      to examine the intersecting effect of age and HIV status on Black SMM social 
      networks in a sample from the Social Network and Prevention Study. Participants 
      were 18 years of age or older, identified as cis-gender Black or African 
      American, self-identified as SMM, reported unprotected sex within the past six 
      months, and resided in Baltimore city or a surrounding county. The sample was 
      divided into four categories by age (e.g., young, mature) and HIV status (e.g., 
      positive, negative). Of the sample, 167 men were (a) Young & HIV negative, 116 
      men were (b) Young & HIV positive, 44 men were (c) Mature & HIV negative, and 42 
      men were (d) Mature & HIV positive. Among the four groups, mature men who were 
      HIV positive had the fewest average number of alters who knew they were SMM. 
      There was also overlap in the range of age of sexual partners across the four 
      groups, ranging from 17 to 53.5 (Group 1), 20-60 (Group 2), 29.5-60 (Group 3), 
      and 23-63 (Group 4) years of age. Although a cross-sectional analysis, our 
      findings suggest value in life course-informed research and practice for 
      providing HIV and sexual health programming. Focus on services provided by 
      community organizations may help mitigate existing disparities.

TI  - Sex Partner Behavior Variation Related to Network Position of and Residential 
      Proximity to Sex Partners Among Young Black Men Who Have Sex with Men.
PG  - 2327-2335
LID - 10.1007/s10461-020-02792-7 [doi]
AB  - This analysis examines how sex behaviors are influenced by a sex partner's 
      network bridging position and the residential proximity between the two. The 
      study sample consisted of 437 young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 
      Chicago and their sex partners (2013-2014). Dyadic analyses that clustered on 
      individuals using generalized estimating equations (n = 1095 relationships) were 
      conducted to assess the associations between different HIV-related sexual 
      behaviors and the network position of and residential proximity to a partner. The 
      odds of group sex was higher with partners who had high network bridging, 
      regardless of how close they lived to one another. The odds of transactional sex 
      was higher with partners who had high network bridging and lived in a different 
      region of the city. Sex behaviors associated with an increased risk of HIV 
      transmission were associated with the network structural position of and 
      residential proximity to partners among YBMSM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indonesia has the second largest tuberculosis (TB) burden globally. 
      Attempts to scale-up TB control efforts have focused on TB households. However, 
      in most high burden settings, considerable Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 
      transmission occurs outside TB households. A better understanding of transmission 
      dynamics in an urban setting in Indonesia will be crucial for the TB Control 
      Program in scaling up efforts towards elimination of TB in a more targeted way. 
      Therefore, the study aims to measure TB prevalence and incidence in household 
      contacts and neighbourhoods in the vicinity of known TB cases and to assess their 
      genomic and epidemiological relatedness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Individuals 
      (~1000) living in the same household as a case diagnosed with pulmonary TB (n = 
      250) or in a neighbouring household (~4500 individuals) will be screened for TB 
      symptoms and by chest x-ray. Two sputum samples will be collected for 
      microbiological analysis from anyone with a productive cough. Any person found to 
      have TB will be treated by the National TB Control Program. All those with no 
      evidence of TB disease will have a repeat screen at 12 months. Whole-genome 
      sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis (SNA) will be conducted on Index 
      cases and contacts diagnosed with TB.

TI  - Preventive effect of on-farm biosecurity practices against highly pathogenic 
      avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 infection on commercial layer farms in the Republic 
      of Korea during the 2016-17 epidemic: A case-control study.

LID - S0167-5877(21)00300-7 [pii]

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIv) H5N6 has destructive consequences 
      on the global poultry production system. Recently, a growing number of layer 
      farms have been heavily damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased 
      virulence of the virus and the intensification of the production system. 
      Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive practices at the 
      farm level that are aligned with contingency measures at the national level to 
      minimize poultry losses. However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm 
      workers to follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and control. 
      Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices varies with the 
      geographical condition and inter-farm contact structures. Hence, the objective of 
      our study was to examine the preventive effect of five biosecurity actions 
      commonly practiced at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: 
      (i) fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a farm; iii) 
      disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection protocols, iv) an anterior room 
      in the sheds before entering the bird area and v) boots changes when moving 
      between sheds in the same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer 
      case farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI epidemic. The odds 
      ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices implemented in those study groups 
      were estimated as a preventive effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, 
      including seven geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian 
      hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location weighted logistic 
      regression. The results showed that the use of a disinfection booth for personnel 
      reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 % 
      credible interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial 
      variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263). Changing boots between sheds 
      on the same farm reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (AOR = 0.160, 95 % CrI 
      = 0.024-0.852) with relatively wide spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR 
      = 0.270-0.688). Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols at the farm 
      of entry for layer farms is recommended to effectively prevent and respond to 
      HPAIv H5N6 infection under different local condition. Our study provides an 
      important message for layer farmers to effectively implement on-farm biosecurity 
      actions against HPAIv H5N6 infection at their farms by setting priorities based 
      on their spatial condition and network position.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph17020596 [doi]
LID - 596
AB  - The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased worldwide. 
      Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is associated with 
      adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life as well as 
      financial burden. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide 
      valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of chronic 
      diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard as they contain semantic 
      information on patients' health conditions. Most studies in this field are 
      focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than 
      multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression of two chronic 
      diseases in the Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the 
      comorbidity progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in 
      Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and represent 
      the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph theory and social 
      network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and 
      CVD and patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative dataset 
      obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two baseline disease 
      networks were constructed from these two selected cohorts. A final disease 
      network from two baseline disease networks was then generated by weight 
      adjustments in a normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and 
      electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in 
      patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that 
      these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD in 
      patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially help the 
      healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns 
      between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could be useful for 
      stakeholders including governments and private health insurers to adopt 
      appropriate preventive health management programs for patients at a high risk of 
      developing multiple chronic diseases.

TI  - Detection of Hate Speech in COVID-19-Related Tweets in the Arab Region: Deep 
      Learning and Topic Modeling Approach.
PG  - e22609
LID - 10.2196/22609 [doi]
LID - e22609
AB  - BACKGROUND: The massive scale of social media platforms requires an automatic 
      solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic solutions will help reduce 
      the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the 
      hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using 
      classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. 
      However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited 
      compared to the published work on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to 
      identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in 
      the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing 
      hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of 
      Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were 
      analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most 
      hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main 
      issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech 
      in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets 
      greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets 
      among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also 
      revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4%) contained a low 
      level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi 
      Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated 
      during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate 
      tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9% of 
      all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab 
      region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter 
      was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson 
      correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly 
      discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted 
      topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech 
      against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political 
      conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. 
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the 
      spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on 
      society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, 
      which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and 
      abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context 
      of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.

TI  - Progreso en Salud: Findings from Two Adapted Social Network HIV Risk Reduction 
      Interventions for Latina Seasonal Workers.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16224530 [doi]
LID - 4530
AB  - BACKGROUND: Miami-Dade County, where many Latina seasonal workers reside and 
      work, has the highest incidence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 
      US: a rate four times the national average. Despite this disproportionate risk 
      for HIV, there are no HIV prevention interventions that aim to decrease HIV among 
      Latina seasonal workers. METHODS: The PROGRESO EN SALUD study compared the 
      outcomes of two interventions adapted to include a social network component 
      (VOICES and HEALTHY). Recruitment used a social network respondent-driven 
      sampling design in which each seed was asked to recruit three friends, and those 
      friends were asked to recruit three friends, for a total of twenty groups of 13 
      friends. We collected data at baseline, and 6 months and 12 months post 
      intervention completion. We used generalized estimating equation models, properly 
      adjusted for non-independent contributions of both social network interventions, 
      to estimate the effects. Gaussian family multivariate models were calculated, 
      addressing exchangeable working correlations, including both individual-level and 
      cluster-level covariates in these models. RESULTS: A total of 261 Latina seasonal 
      workers participated in either the HEALTHY or the VOICES intervention. There were 
      significant changes over time in cognitive factors (HIV knowledge, condom use 
      self-efficacy, and adequate knowledge of condom use), behavioral factors (condom 
      use, female condom use, and HIV testing), and communication factors (talking with 
      friends about HIV prevention and intention to negotiate safe sex with male 
      partners). DISCUSSION: This study supports the literature suggesting that 
      interventions incorporating social networks can have positive effects on HIV 
      prevention and treatment outcomes, including sustained benefits beyond study 
      periods.

TI  - Contact tracing strategies in household and congregate environments to identify 
      cases of tuberculosis in low- and moderate-incidence populations.

LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD013077.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD013077
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease that is spread via 
      respiratory droplets from infected individuals to susceptible contacts. To 
      eliminate this disease from low- and medium-incidence settings, people who are 
      most likely to be infected (contacts) must be identified. Recently, study authors 
      have examined alternate approaches to contact tracing methods that demonstrate 
      improved detection and prioritization of contacts. The comparative benefit of 
      these methods has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness 
      of novel methods of contact tracing versus current standard of care to identify 
      latent and active cases in low- to moderate-incidence settings. SEARCH METHODS: 
      We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, and CINAHL up to 15 
      July 2019. We also searched for clinical trials and examined reference lists and 
      conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      and cluster-RCTs of contact tracing strategies that included alternate approaches 
      (other than standard practice). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently assessed identified articles for eligibility and quality using 
      prespecified criteria. MAIN RESULTS: No trials met the inclusion criteria of this 
      review. Several study authors described an alternate method for examining 
      contacts and performing social network analysis but did not compare this with the 
      current contact tracing approach. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane Review 
      highlights the lack of research in support of the current contact tracing method 
      and the need for RCTs to compare new methods such as social network analysis to 
      improve contact tracing processes.

TI  - Localizing COVID-19 Misinformation: A Case Study of Tracking Twitter Pandemic 
      Narratives in Pennsylvania Using Computational Network Science.
PG  - 76-85
LID - 10.1080/10810730.2023.2217102 [doi]
AB  - The recent COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the importance of effective 
      communication strategies to control the spread of the virus and debunk 
      misinformation. By using accurate narratives, both online and offline, we can 
      motivate communities to follow preventive measures and shape attitudes toward 
      them. However, the abundance of misinformation stories can lead to vaccine 
      hesitancy, obstructing the timely implementation of preventive measures, such as 
      vaccination. Therefore, it is crucial to create appropriate and 
      community-centered solutions based on regional data analysis to address 
      mis/disinformation narratives and implement effective countermeasures specific to 
      the particular geographic area.In this case study, we have attempted to create a 
      research pipeline to analyze local narratives on social media, particularly 
      Twitter, to identify misinformation spread locally, using the state of 
      Pennsylvania as an example. Our proposed methodology pipeline identifies main 
      communication trends and misinformation stories for the major cities and counties 
      in southwestern PA, aiming to assist local health officials and public health 
      specialists in instantly addressing pandemic communication issues, including 
      misinformation narratives. Additionally, we investigated anti-vax actors' 
      strategies in promoting harmful narratives. Our pipeline includes data 
      collection, Twitter influencer analysis, Louvain clustering, BEND maneuver 
      analysis, bot identification, and vaccine stance detection. Public health 
      organizations and community-centered entities can implement this data-driven 
      approach to health communication to inform their pandemic strategies.

AB  - To prevent obesity among Latino youth in the United States and Latin America, it 
      is necessary to understand the specific context and interplay of physical 
      activity (PA) and the built environment (BE). This paper aims to advance the 
      research agenda of BE and PA for obesity prevention in Latin America and among 
      Latino youth in the United States by (1) identifying environmental indicators to 
      inform the design of interventions and policy, (2) identifying interdisciplinary 
      methodological approaches for the study of the complex association between BE and 
      PA, and (3) presenting case studies of PA-promoting BE programs. A group of U.S. 
      and Latin American scientists collaboratively worked to propose innovative 
      indicators of the BE, methodological approaches for the study of the complex 
      association between BE and PA, and review case studies of PA-promoting BE 
      programs in both regions. The results identified gaps in knowledge, proposed 
      environmental indicators (e.g., landscape, street design, mobility patterns, and 
      crime and safety), reviewed methodological approaches (social network analysis, 
      citizen science methods), and case studies illustrating PA-promoting BE programs 
      (i.e., play streets, active school transport, and school setting interventions). 
      The obesity prevention among Latino and Latin American youth requires advanced 
      research on BE and PA addressing context-specific priorities and exchanging 
      lessons learned.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis To Describe the Transmission 
      Dynamics Among Inuit Residing in Iqaluit Nunavut Using Whole-Genome Sequencing.
PG  - 2187-2195
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among Inuit in the 
      Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to better understand the 
      transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome 
      sequencing. METHODS: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB 
      in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing 
      (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was 
      calculated using a threshold of a ≤3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data 
      using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological 
      data was used to support the WGS data analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 
      140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four 
      clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 
      62% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this 
      cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading 
      events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a 
      nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to 
      nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the 
      determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility (κ 
      score .98, 95% confidence interval, .97-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests 
      that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending 
      time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have 
      been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit 
      Arctic community.

TI  - The Diffusion of Smoking: Association Between School Tobacco Policies and the 
      Diffusion of Adolescent Smoking in 38 Schools in 6 Countries.
PG  - 752-764
LID - 10.1007/s11121-022-01486-x [doi]
AB  - Social network research has evidenced the role of peer effects in the adoption of 
      behaviours. Little is known, however, about whether policies affect how 
      behaviours are shared in a network. To contribute to this literature, we apply 
      the concept of diffusion centrality to school tobacco policies and adolescent 
      smoking. Diffusion centrality is a measure of centrality which refers to a 
      person's ability to diffuse a given property-in our case, smoking-related 
      behaviours. We hypothesized that stronger school tobacco policies are associated 
      with less diffusion centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in 
      general. A whole network study was carried out in 2013 and 2016 among adolescents 
      (n = 18,805) in 38 schools located in six European cities. Overall, diffusion 
      centrality of smoking in general and of smoking on school premises significantly 
      decreased over time. Diffusion centrality of smoking significantly decreased both 
      in schools where the policy strengthened or softened over time, but for diffusion 
      of smoking on school premises, this decrease was only significant in schools 
      where it strengthened. Finally, stronger school tobacco policies were associated 
      with lower diffusion centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in 
      general, though to a lesser extent. With such policies, smoking may, therefore, 
      become less prevalent, less popular, and less clustered, thereby lowering the 
      risk of it spreading within networks in, and even outside the school.

      waves in Hong Kong.
PG  - 911-923
LID - 10.1080/09603123.2022.2064438 [doi]
AB  - Exposure setting is crucial in the formation and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 
      transmission clusters. In this cohort study, transmission networks of 2 waves 
      were differentiated by exposure setting using territory-wide surveillance data 
      with clinical and laboratory records in Hong Kong. Characteristically, the first 
      wave had resulted from imported cases followed by local transmissions, while the 
      second wave was constituted primarily by local infections. With a 4-fold higher 
      caseload, the second wave featured predominance of epidemiologically linked, 
      local, older and asymptomatic patients with higher viral loads and shorter 
      inpatient days. The 1028 transmission clusters formed 155 cascades composing at 
      least two clusters. Daily and social activities were exposure settings that 
      bridged clusters while residences usually terminated transmission cascades. 
      Regulatory restrictions on social activities extinguished cluster formation in 
      bars, but shifted to private parties in the second wave. The results confirmed 
      that strategic interventions targeting exposure settings could achieve effective 
      epidemic control.

TI  - Tribal Reservation Adolescent Connections Study: A study protocol using mixed 
      methods for examining social networks and associated outcomes among American 
      Indian youth on a Northern Plains reservation.

LID - S0145-2134(23)00179-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rich cultural and traditional practices make interpersonal 
      relationships vital for American Indian (AI) youth. Social relations and 
      multigenerational networks (i.e., peer, family, kinship, and community) remain a 
      salient fixture of AI culture, survival and thriving in reservation communities. 
      Research in other populations has demonstrated how social networks impact youth 
      risk and resilience, but data are lacking on AI adolescent networks. 
      Intergenerational trauma from settler colonialism leads some AI youth to early 
      initiation of substance use and subsequent substance misuse, along with 
      disproportionately high risk for suicide and vulnerability to witnessing and 
      experiencing violence. Using network data to develop prevention strategies among 
      this population is a promising new avenue of research. In this study protocol 
      paper, we describe the rationale and methodology of an exploratory study to be 
      conducted with American Indian 9th and 10th graders at three schools on a 
      Northern Plains reservation. METHODS: This mixed methods study will collect 
      quantitative social network surveys (N = 300) and qualitative interviews 
      (n = 30). The study will examine the extent to which existing social network 
      theories and data metrics adequately characterize AI youth networks or how they 
      may need to be expanded for this population. Associations of network 
      characteristics with risk and protective factors for substance use, exposure to 
      violence, and suicide will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This innovative 
      methodological approach holds promise for informing the development of effective 
      preventive approaches to address co-occurring risks for substance use, violence 
      and suicide among AI adolescents. Understanding processes that impact social 
      networks among AI adolescents can promote culturally resonant social 
      relationships that may support better outcomes for youth.

TI  - Investigation of Measles Outbreak among Thai and Migrant Workers in Two Factories 
      in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, 2019.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17134627 [doi]
LID - 4627
AB  - On 22 March 2019 the Thai Department of Disease Control (DDC) was notified that 
      16 workers, including Thai and Myanmar migrant workers, from two factories 
      located in Nakhon Phathom Province, had presented with a fever with rash during 
      the previous 2 weeks. Active case finding was conducted among workers in both 
      factories using face-to-face interviews. Suspected cases were defined as a worker 
      who developed fever with rash with one of the following symptoms: cough, coryza 
      or conjunctivitis. Testing for measles IgM antibodies and viral identification 
      through throat swabs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to confirm 
      diagnosis. Vaccination history among cases was reviewed. Nationality and 
      age-specific attack rates (AR) were calculated. An environmental study and a 
      social network analysis were conducted to better understand the transmission 
      process. A total 56 cases (AR = 0.97%) were identified. Of 21 serum measles IgM 
      collected, 8 (38.0%) were positive. Of 8 throat swabs collected, 5 (62.5%) were 
      positive for measles genotype D8. The disease attack rate in migrant employees 
      was twice as large as the rate in Thai counterparts (AR = 0.7 and 1.4%). The 
      first case was identified as a Myanmar worker who arrived in Thailand two weeks 
      prior to his illness. The Myanmar workers' accommodation was more crowded than 
      that for Thai workers. The hot spots of transmission were found at a drinking 
      water tank which had shared glasses. Among the cases, 62.5% could not recall 
      their vaccination history, and 25% had never had an injection containing a 
      measles vaccination. The majority of migrant cases had never completed a two-dose 
      measles vaccination. To halt the outbreak, measles vaccines were administered to 
      the employees, particularly those working in the same sections with the cases and 
      shared glasses were removed. For future policy action, a vaccination program 
      should be incorporated into the work permit issuance process.

TI  - Low credibility URL sharing on Twitter during reporting linking rare blood clots 
      with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
PG  - e0296444

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an "infodemic" of misinformation. 
      Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had 
      serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about 
      links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients 
      developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any 
      reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on 
      Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data 
      containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period 
      centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. 
      We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network 
      analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most 
      influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information 
      about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak 
      of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an 
      increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated 
      on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network 
      structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation 
      were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of 
      low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of 
      self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on 
      Twitter. The findings suggest that the simple approach adopted within the 
      research to identify the most popular and influential sources of low-credibility 
      content presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and social 
      media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter the propagation of 
      misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking news event.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Characterizing the diffusion of adopted changes in policy and 
      clinical practice can inform enhanced implementation strategies to ensure prompt 
      uptake in public health emergencies and other rapidly evolving disease areas. A 
      novel guidance document was introduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
      British Columbia (BC), Canada, which supported clinicians to prescribe opioids, 
      stimulants, and benzodiazepines. We aimed to determine the extent to which uptake 
      and discontinuation of an initial attempt at a prescribed safer supply (PSS) 
      program were influenced through networks of prescribers. METHODS: We executed a 
      retrospective population-based study using linked health administrative data that 
      captured all clinicians who prescribed to at least one client with a substance 
      use disorder from March 27, 2020, to August 31, 2021. Our main exposure was the 
      prescribing patterns of an individuals' peers, defined as the proportion of a 
      prescribers' professional network (based on shared clients), which had previously 
      prescribed PSS, updated monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a clinician 
      had prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given calendar month. The 
      secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS prescribing, defined as an 
      absence for PSS prescriptions for at least 3 months. We estimated logistic 
      regression models using generalized estimated equations on monthly repeated 
      measurements to determine and characterize the extent to which peer networks 
      influenced the initiation and discontinuation of PSS prescribing, controlling for 
      network, clinician, and caseload characteristics. Innovators were defined as 
      individuals initiating PSS prior to May 2020, and early adopters were individuals 
      initiating PSS after. RESULTS: Among 14,137 prescribers treating clients with 
      substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators of prescribed safer supply and 
      1062 early adopters through the end of study follow-up, but 653 (50.6%) were no 
      longer prescribing by August 2021. Prescribers with over 20% of peers whom had 
      adopted PSS had a nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing 
      themselves (aOR: 3.79, 95% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those with no connected 
      safer supply prescribers. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of PSS in BC was highly 
      dependent on the behavior of prescribers' peer networks. Future implementation 
      strategies to support PSS or other policies would benefit from leveraging 
      networks of prescribers.

TI  - Comorbidity Patterns of Older Lung Cancer Patients in Northeast China: An 
      Association Rules Analysis Based on Electronic Medical Records.

LID - 9119
AB  - PURPOSES: This study aims to identify the comorbidity patterns of older men with 
      lung cancer in China. METHODS: We analyzed the electronic medical records (EMRs) 
      of lung cancer patients over age 65 in the Jilin Province of China. The data 
      studied were obtained from 20 hospitals of Jilin Province in 2018. In total, 1510 
      patients were identified. We conducted a rank-frequency analysis and social 
      network analysis to identify the predominant comorbidities and comorbidity 
      networks. We applied the association rules to mine the comorbidity combination 
      with the values of confidence and lift. A heatmap was utilized to visualize the 
      rules. RESULTS: Our analyses discovered that (1) there were 31 additional medical 
      conditions in older patients with lung cancer. The most frequent comorbidities 
      were pneumonia, cerebral infarction, and hypertension. (2) The network-based 
      analysis revealed seven subnetworks. (3) The association rules analysis provided 
      41 interesting rules. The results revealed that hypertension, ischemic 
      cardiomyopathy, and pneumonia are the most frequent comorbid combinations. Heart 
      failure may not have a strong implicating role in these comorbidity patterns. 
      Cerebral infarction was rarely combined with other diseases. In addition, 
      glycoprotein metabolism disorder comorbid with hyponatremia or hypokalemia 
      increased the risk of anemia by more than eight times in older lung cancer 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the comorbidity patterns 
      of older men with lung cancer in China. Understanding the comorbidity patterns of 
      older patients with lung cancer can assist clinicians in their diagnoses and 
      contribute to developing healthcare policies, as well as allocating resources.

TI  - Differential Influence of Same- and Cross-Ethnic Friends on Ethnic-Racial 
      Identity Development in Early Adolescence.
PG  - 949-963
LID - 10.1111/cdev.13240 [doi]
AB  - Recent research has shown that peers influence ethnic-racial identity (ERI) 
      development during early adolescence. Arguments based on social identity theory, 
      however, suggest that only same-ethnic but not cross-ethnic friends are important 
      for ERI development. Using longitudinal social network analysis, we examined peer 
      influence of both same- and cross-ethnic friends on ERI attachment and private 
      regard. Data were drawn from six ethnically diverse schools in Western Germany 
      (N = 1,349; M(age)  = 13.3). Our results provide empirical evidence for early 
      adolescents' ERI being influenced by same- but less by cross-ethnic friends. 
      Considering peers' ethnicity therefore is crucial for understanding peer 
      influence on ERI development.

TI  - [Analysis of pigs' movement to Lombardy (Northern Italy) to assess the potential 
      risk of pathogens introduction into this region and to plan mitigation measures].
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.19191/EP21.1-2.P037.037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to analyse the trade flow of pigs to Lombardy (Northern Italy) to 
      single out the farms more involved in animal movements to identify the holdings 
      and areas most exposed to the risk of introducing pathogens into the region and 
      to plan proper mitigation measures. Indeed, the movement of live animals and of 
      the means of transport is one of the main risk factors in the spread of diseases 
      and this is particularly relevant in areas with high stocking density. DESIGN: 
      statistical analysis on movements of pigs entering Lombardy was carried out. Data 
      on pigs' movements and farm characteristics were collected from the National and 
      Regional databases. Social Network Analysis (SNA) was used to analyse the flows 
      of pigs to Lombardy, to identify the holdings and geographical areas that are 
      central in the trading network and that could have a role in the introduction of 
      swine pathogens into the region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data on pigs' 
      movements introduced into Lombardy in 2016 were analysed. Lombardy is a region of 
      Northern Italy with intensive livestock husbandry. The pig sector is of 
      particular economic relevance also in view of the processing industry, suited to 
      the production of high quality pork products. Annually about 1.8 million pigs are 
      introduced into the region also to satisfy the request of the processing industry 
      for the production of pork products. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: in this study, the 
      farms that buy pigs from outside the region were identified as well as the 
      territories where the largest number of pigs are introduced. The analysis was 
      carried out also considering certain factors related to the movement of animals, 
      which can be relevant for the transmission of pathogens, such as number of 
      commercial partners, number of exchanged animals, and number of shipments. 
      RESULTS: in 2016, 1,782,568 pigs were introduced into Lombardy; by using SNA, it 
      was possible to highlight a complex trade network of pigs, mainly involving the 
      Northern regions. Indeed, the pigs were mostly purchased from Emilia Romagna 
      (33.4%), followed by Veneto and Piedmont. These regions have been the most 
      closely analysed in this study. SNA was also used to identify Lombardy 
      territories (provinces and municipalities) which, based on the number of 
      introduced pigs, are potentially most exposed to the introduction of pathogens 
      from outside the region. Mantua and Brescia provinces resulted the most exposed 
      area. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is one of most important European producers of pigs and 
      about 50% of national pig assets is present in Lombardy; furthermore, about 1.8 
      million pigs are introduced yearly into the region. Currently, the region is free 
      from the main diseases of pigs and the introduction of an epidemic disease into 
      the pig population could adversely affect the entire productive sector. For this 
      reason, an analysis of the movements of pigs entering the region was carried out 
      to identify the areas (provinces, municipalities) and holdings most exposed to 
      the risk of introduction of pathogens. This information is relevant for the 
      veterinary authorities to plan appropriate control activities (official controls, 
      surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination, where possible) in order to enhance 
      disease prevention and promote early detection.

TI  - Racial/Ethnic disparities in the chains of morbid events leading to death: 
      network analysis of US multiple cause of death data.
PG  - 149-165
LID - 10.1080/19485565.2023.2271841 [doi]
AB  - Multiple-cause-of-death data have not yet been applied to the study of 
      racial/ethnic differences in causal chains of events leading to death, nor they 
      have been used to examine racial/ethnic disparities in cause-of-death 
      certification. We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to 
      reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and 
      analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 
      60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative 
      prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between 
      diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) 
      had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were 
      burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) 
      exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was 
      observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's 
      disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and 
      diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further 
      decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular 
      diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia. To sum up, races/ethnicities not 
      only vary in structure and timing of death but they differ in morbid processes 
      leading to death as well.
