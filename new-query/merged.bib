  abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of
   social network analysis to understand public discourse on Twitter around
   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined
   different network properties that might affect the successful
   dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public
   health officials and health agencies. Methods: We focused on
   conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late
   January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software
   that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as
   Twitter. Results: We found that the network of conversations around
   COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected;
   these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public
   health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation
   can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public
   health. Conclusions: Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading
   picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social
   media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social
   network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral
   part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and
   evaluate risk communication efforts.},

  abstract = {Background/Aim The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was officially
   recorded on March 11, 2020. Social media use increased worldwide, as
   well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake
   news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the
   world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions
   related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before
   and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials
   and methods Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and
   after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created
   based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their
   influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters
   that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results In the
   pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine
   views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the
   Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The
   vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and
   the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations
   received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between
   influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions
   This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media
   data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination
   in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of
   the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network
   analysis would help reduce the ``infodemic{''} before administering the
   vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively
   in this regard.},

   propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using
   adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy
   on sensitive links while persevering sufficient non-sensitive

   Furthermore, anti-vaccination pages on Facebook reflect a highly
   `feminised' movement the vast majority of participants are women.

  abstract = {BackgroundSociometric or whole network analysis, a method used to
   analyze relational patterns among social actors, emphasizes the role of
   social structure in shaping behaviour. Such method has been applied to
   many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public
   health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social
   networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network
   analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current
   scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network
   analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such
   methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of
   six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political
   Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO)
   returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be
   included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social
   network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized
   quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a
   description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network
   analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last
   decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree
   centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong
   to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network
   resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The
   second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social
   support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on
   the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service
   providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network

  abstract = {Background: The popularity of the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and
   other conspiracy theories of a similar nature creates challenges to
   promoting vaccines and disseminating accurate health information.
   Objective: Health conspiracy theories are gaining in popularity. This
   study's objective was to evaluate the Twitter social media network
   related to the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and apply social
   capital theory to analyze the unique social structures of influential
   users. As a strategy for web-based public health surveillance, we
   conducted a social network analysis to identify the important opinion
   leaders sharing the conspiracy, the key websites, and the narratives.
   Methods: A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using
   social network analysis. Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13,
   2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. Tweets were retrieved via a
   dedicated Twitter application programming interface. More specifically,
   the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the
   data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research
   Foundation) and Gephi.
   Results: There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users
   within the data set. This study found that the most influential user
   within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the
   magnetic vaccine conspiracy. There were also several other users that
   became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a
   retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the
   network.
   Conclusions: Our study found that influential users were effective
   broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond
   their own networks of Twitter followers. We emphasize the need for trust
   in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in
   the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the
   COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be
   unpredictable. This study highlights the potential of influential users
   to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique
   social capital.},

   economic burden. Cases and associated burdens, however, could be
   prevented with a greater awareness of, and interventions related to,
   skin cancer and melanoma-related preventive behaviors. In fact, as
   social media use is close to ubiquitous, it represents a potential
   communication modality. However, more research is needed to understand
   the current state of melanoma-related information exchanged between
   Twitter users. This study aimed to understand the different types of
   users controlling the melanoma-related information diffusion and
   conversation themes on Twitter. Methods: Tweets (n = 692) were imported
   from Twitter between 1 and 31 May 2021 using the Twitter public API; and
   uploaded to NodeXL to conduct a social network analysis. Results: Health
   professionals and organizations with medical backgrounds were the main
   content producers, disseminators, and top influencers. However,
   information diffusion is slow and uneven among users. Additionally,
   conversations lacked a focus on preventive behaviors. Conclusion:
   Twitter is a potential platform for the targeted outreach of individuals
   in melanoma awareness campaigns. This study provides insights maximizing
   the effectiveness of Twitter as a communication modality. Our findings
   can help guide the development of customized content and interventions
   during melanoma awareness campaigns.},

   products requires an understanding of specific audience segments
   including their views, intentions, use of media, perceived barriers, and
   benefits of change. For example, identifying and targeting individuals
   who express ambivalence about e-cigarette use on Twitter may be helpful
   in devising and focusing public health campaigns to reduce e-cigarette
   use. This study developed a novel analytic strategy using social network
   analysis to identify audience segments on Twitter based on positive,
   negative, and neutral e-cigarette sentiment Using Twitter data collected
   from April 2015 to March 2016, we identified different sub-groups of
   users who retweeted about e-cigarettes, and measured each subgroup's
   clustering coefficient (CC), which describes how tightly people cluster
   together. Ten high CC and ten low CC groups were randomly selected; then
   100 randomly selected tweets from each group were coded for e-cigarette
   sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Results indicate that
   differences in e-cigarette sentiment are associated with clustering of
   Twitter network ties. Statistical analyses revealed that high CC groups
   were more likely to have strong e-cigarette sentiments, suggesting that
   tightly clustered groups may be ``echo chambers{''} (i.e., like-minded
   people repeating the same messages). By contrast, low CC groups were
   more likely to have neutral sentiments, and had greater fluctuation in
   sentiment over time, suggesting that they may be more flexible in their
   opinions about e-cigarettes and may be particularly receptive to
   targeted public health campaigns. Informatics techniques such as
   determination of clusters using social network analysis can be useful in
   identifying audience segments for future public health campaigns.},

  journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {14},
  month = {MAR 28},
  abstract = {Background A key research question with theoretical and practical
   implications is to investigate the various conditions by which social
   network sites (SNS) may either enhance or interfere with mental
   well-being, given the omnipresence of SNS and their dual effects on
   well-being.
   Method/process We study SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for
   users' personal (i.e., self-disclosure) and situational (i.e., social
   networks) attributes, using a mixed design of content analysis and
   social network analysis.
   Result/conclusion We compare users' within-person changes in
   self-disclosure and social networks in two phases (over half a year),
   drawing on Weibo Depression SuperTalk, an online community for
   depression, and find: Several network attributes strengthen social
   support, including network connectivity, global efficiency, degree
   centralization, hubs of communities, and reciprocal interactions. Users'
   self-disclosure attributes reflect positive changes in mental well-being
   and increased attachment to the community. Correlations exist between
   users' topological and self-disclosure attributes. A Poisson regression
   model extracts self-disclosure attributes that may affect users'
   received social support, including the writing length, number of active
   days, informal words, adverbs, negative emotion words, biological
   process words, and first-person singular forms.
   Innovation We combine social network analysis with content analysis,
   highlighting the need to understand SNS' effects on well-being by
   accounting for users' self-disclosure (content) and communication
   partners (social networks).
   Implication/contribution Authentic user data helps to avoid recall bias
   commonly found in self-reported data. A longitudinal within-person
   analysis of SNS' effects on well-being is helpful for policymakers in
   public health intervention, community managers for group organizations,
   and users in online community engagement.},

  year = {2019},

  month = {FEB 13},
  abstract = {Background: TB outbreaks in educational institutions can result in
   significant transmission and pose a considerable threat to TB control.
   Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological
   tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties
   characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole
   genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide
   additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health
   action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with
   traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak
   in an educational setting.
   Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with
   a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through
   laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through
   clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection.
   Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and
   screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M.
   tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial
   regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated
   with case status and risk communities.
   Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7\% positivity rate) and nine
   active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was
   39.1\% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious
   case (odds ratio 7.3, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The
   community structure analysis divided the students into five communities
   based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social
   network analysis identified that the community including the suspected
   index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds
   ratio 7.5, 95\% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were
   lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single
   SNP difference.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an
   undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting
   within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome
   sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission
   network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide
   further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological
   approaches to direct public health action in this setting.},

  abstract = {The stability of social network structure (SSNS) in historical towns is
   influenced by changes in built environments and demographic factors. The
   historical towns in China have evolved into massive rural-urban
   migration under the rapid urbanization over the past forty years. In
   this context, many of these historical towns experienced ``declining
   built environment and disintegrating social networks, `` which does not
   contribute to the adaptive renewal of the built environment and social
   networks in historical towns, as well as the psychological health of
   residents. This article intends to explore the adaptive renewal of the
   built environment and social networks of historical towns based on the
   SSNS. Data on ``households `` and ``social ties `` (i.e., kinship,
   geographic, and job relationship) among households were collected via a
   field survey in seven historical towns in Chongqing, China. K-core
   models of social network analysis (SNA) were calculated to analyze SSNS.
   The result shows that the social networks of historical towns with
   centripetal-shaped structures were more stable than historical towns
   with divergent-shaped structures. Moreover, spatial layout forms and
   functions of households might affect the stability of social networks in
   historical towns. Based on the results of the analysis of SSNS,
   strategies for adaptive renewal of the built environments and social
   networks were put forward in two aspects. The built environment, such as
   the classification of public spaces and service facilities, can be
   designed based on the k-core indicator for increasing the spatial
   connection of households in the historical towns. In addition, increased
   social activities in historical towns with weak SSNS may promote social
   connection of households, and are also helpful in boosting public health
   in psychological aspects.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of online medical treatments, social media has
   become a prevalent platform to spread health-related information. For
   public health campaigns, how to diffuse the message broadly and
   efficiently in the social network is a classical problem, which is named
   Influence Maximization (IM). IM can be considered as an algorithmic
   problem of finding a small set of network users as seed nodes that
   maximizes the spread of influence for a piece of information under a
   certain influence cascade model. With a lot of researches focusing on
   this field, most existing solutions are proposed to extract seed nodes
   only considering pure topological structures. In practice, nodes in
   health-related networks are often abundantly accompanied with other
   types of meaningful information such as node attributes (identity),
   second-order proximity, and edge attributes (user relationship), while
   conventional IM models overlook these information. Therefore, a general
   framework for incorporating the heterogeneous information into an IM
   model could be potentially helpful to find underlying seed nodes in
   health-related networks. Moreover, the stability and the computational
   cost are also the main challenges that current IM models face. To bridge
   these gaps, in this paper, we propose NE-IM (Network Embedding for
   Influence Maximization), a method that aspires to address both problems
   using representation learning. NE-IM composes of two components:
   Structure-based embedding and feature-based embedding. They are the
   projections of network structures and heterogeneous information
   respectively in a low dimensional space, so that each node in
   health-related network can be represented as a fix dimensional vector.
   Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform
   baseline approaches.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent work in social network analysis has shown the
   usefulness of analysing and predicting outcomes from user-generated data
   in the context of Public Health Surveillance (PHS). Most of the
   proposals have focused on dealing with static datasets gathered from
   social networks, which are processed and mined off-line. However, little
   work has been done on providing a general framework to analyse the
   highly dynamic data of social networks from a multidimensional
   perspective. In this paper, we claim that such a framework is crucial
   for including social data in PHS systems. Methods: We propose a dynamic
   multidimensional approach to deal with social data streams. In this
   approach, dynamic dimensions are continuously updated by applying
   unsupervised text mining methods. More specifically, we analyse the
   semantics and temporal patterns in posts for identifying relevant
   events, topics and users. We also define quality metrics to detect
   relevant user profiles. In this way, the incoming data can be further
   filtered to cope with the goals of PHS systems. Results: We have
   evaluated our approach over a long-term stream of Twitter. We show how
   the proposed quality metrics allow us to filter out the users that are
   out-of-domain as well as those with low quality in their messages. We
   also explain how specific user profiles can be identified through their
   descriptions. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed multidimensional
   model can be used to identify main events and topics, as well as to
   analyse their audience and impact. Conclusions: The results show that
   the proposed dynamic multidimensional model is able to identify relevant
   events and topics and analyse them from different perspectives, which is
   especially useful for PHS systems.},

  month = {OCT 5},
  abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy
   theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a
   hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are ``empty.{''} Research has
   shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that
   an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and
   other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second
   wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of
   the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it.
   Objective: This study set out to evaluate the \#FilmYourHospital
   conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers
   behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which
   online sources of information were used as evidence to support the
   theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and
   what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy
   theory in the future.
   Methods: Twitter data related to the \#FilmYourHospital hashtag were
   retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day
   period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets
   and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify
   accounts with a higher probability of being bots.
   Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are
   ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit
   supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked
   to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter
   user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the
   platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and
   deleted accounts within the network.
   Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be
   targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation.
   Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or
   remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities
   could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative
   content.},

   increasingly utilized to integrate community voice into decision-making
   processes of health-related interventions, programs, and practice.
   However, community partners' collaboration experiences remain
   understated in the literature. Thus, there is a need to further advance
   methodological approaches that examine the effectiveness of CAPs, while
   also highlighting community voice to, ultimately, improve public health
   outcomes.
   Objectives: (1) To demonstrate how a practical approach to mixed methods
   social network analysis (MMSNA) can highlight power dynamics in
   community health partnerships and use MMSNA data to build relationships
   across stakeholders for systems change efforts
   Methods: MMSNA was used to examine a CAP focused on public health equity
   in a Midwest region. The project applied a sequential mixed methods
   design (QUAN -> QUAL) with a network survey and individual
   semi-structured interviews. Both data strands served the function of
   expansion, where quantitative data identified what relationships existed
   in the network, level of activity, and factors for motivations,
   providing breadth of collaboration. Qualitative data further elaborated
   on how partners perceived these experiences, providing depth and
   contextualizing quantitative results.
   Conclusions: Systems level approaches must be applied to capture broader
   contexts (e.g., community, interpersonal, and individual) surrounding
   community health partnerships. The use of MMSNA maximizes benefits from
   a systems methodology-social network analysis-with qualitative
   interviews that allow for the critical assessment of network structure
   and community centered perspectives. Community health partnerships are
   encouraged to utilize this approach in order to deliver more sustainable
   public health efforts centered on the community that is directly

   We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health
   outcomes using a five-step guide.
   Background:
   Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has
   more recently been used to study health-related topics including
   obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and
   healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial
   analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or
   built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence,
   quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network
   processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some
   common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social
   networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social
   network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and
   reproducibility.
   Methods:
   We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology
   focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks,
   take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own
   connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters.
   Results:
   We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health
   outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model
   selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection
   considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and
   health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social
   network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also
   present an example of SNA.
   Conclusions:
   SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how
   relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors-and
   subsequently health.},

  abstract = {BackgroundAsthma is a condition in which the airways become inflamed and
   constricted, causing breathing difficulties, wheezing, coughing, and
   chest tightness. Social networks can have a substantial effect on asthma
   management and results. However, no studies of social networks
   addressing asthma have been undertaken.ObjectiveThe aim of this research
   was to identify the significant social network structures, key
   influencers, top topics, and sentiments of asthma-related Twitter
   conversations.MethodsAll the tweets collected for this study included
   the keyword ``asthma{''} or were mentioned in or in replies to tweets
   that were performed. For this study, a random sample of Twitter data was
   collected using NodeXL Pro software between December 1, 2022, and
   January 29, 2023. The data collected includes the user's display name,
   Twitter handle, tweet text, and the tweet's publishing date and time.
   After being imported into the Gephi application, the NodeXL data were
   then shown using the Fruchterman-Reingold layout method. In our study,
   SNA (Social Network Analysis) metrics were utilized to identify the most
   popular subject using hashtags, sentiment-related phrases (positive,
   negative, or neutral), and top influencer by centrality measures
   (degree, betweenness).ResultsThe study collected 48,122 tweets
   containing the keyword ``asthma{''} or mentioned in replies. News
   reporters and journalists emerged as top influencers based on centrality
   measures in Twitter conversations about asthma, followed by government
   and healthcare institutions. Education, trigger factors (e.g., cat
   exposure, diet), and associated conditions were highly discussed topics
   on asthma-related social media posts (e.g., sarscov2, copd). Our study's
   sentiment analysis revealed that there were 8427 phrases associated
   neutral comments (18\%), 12,582 words reflecting positive viewpoints
   (26\%), and 27,111 words reflecting negative opinions
   (56\%).ConclusionThis study investigates the relevance of social media
   influencers, news reporters, health experts, health organizations, and
   the government in the dissemination and promotion of asthma-related
   education and awareness during public health information.},

   and threatening health care systems. Little attention has been paid to
   the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care
   entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department
   of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social
   network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in
   Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in
   Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed
   network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of
   relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance
   data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include
   metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such
   as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional
   networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed
   that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the
   flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not
   be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care
   hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental
   health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for
   flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health
   care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals.
   Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public
   health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining
   which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination
   of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This
   information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and
   develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt

  abstract = {Background Exposure to visual posts featuring e-cigarette products on
   social media is associated with increased e-cigarette use among US
   adolescents. Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media
   marketing, where influencers-for example, bloggers, brand
   ambassadors-post promotional materials. This study analysed the network
   of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the
   most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. Methods We
   tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted
   promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and
   high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of
   1\%-25\% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we
   identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities)
   influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers'
   followers aged 13-17 years old and the age verification practices
   restricting youth access were also assessed. Results There is a highly
   interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55)
   worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The
   Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers
   compared with the European influencers. 75\% of the influencers did not
   restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The
   brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso
   collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20).
   Conclusions It is important to understand associations among influencers
   and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective
   public health communication and potential policies that could regulate

   Design/methodology/approach: We used an online questionnaire to survey
   social service agency staff involved in delivering the programme in 63
   communities. We collected data about their information seeking practices
   regarding four types of information: hiking and parks, mental health,
   funding sources, and the Mood Walks programme.
   Findings: Social network analysis confirmed that social service agencies
   turned to park and recreation sector partners for information about
   hiking and local hiking amenities but did not seek information from them
   about mental health, funding sources, or the programme itself.
   Practical implications: Park and recreation sector partners are viewed
   by other sectoral partners as sources of critical information in the
   delivery of this park-based health initiative.

   a dataset containing social network data, and a glossary of key terms in
   social network analysis. We conclude with a set of recommendations for
   researchers interested in applying SNA to their own contexts and content

   informatics, sociology, and medicine has demonstrated the importance of
   recognizing the complexity inherent in individuals' connections with
   others. In this article, we provide a brief conceptual overview of
   social network theory and methodology, and then demonstrate how to apply
   SNA to an applied psychological research context studying students
   embedded in classrooms. We also provide numerous supporting materials on
   our OSF page, including R code for all analyses, a dataset containing
   social network data, and a glossary of key terms in social network
   analysis. We conclude with a set of recommendations for researchers
   interested in applying SNA to their own contexts and content areas.},

  abstract = {Background: The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has brought vaccine
   hesitancy to the forefront in managing this pandemic. COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to
   the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread
   global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online
   information, particularly information on social media. The first step
   toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the
   current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization
   debate on social media platforms.Objective: We aimed to evaluate
   societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19
   vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform
   communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance.Methods: Social
   network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to
   characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets
   published in English and French were collected through the Twitter
   application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just
   following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was
   used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions
   on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised
   machine learning approach to natural language processing using a
   sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual
   similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine
   hesitancy.Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main
   themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of
   safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the
   government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety
   and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation
   around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the
   population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and
   there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly
   one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) of the conversations on COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of
   institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and
   nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) expressed criticism toward the
   government's handling of the pandemic.Conclusions: Social media content
   analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into
   the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of
   safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered,
   as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed
   on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.},

   applied to different domains in recent years, including public health.
   The complete procedure for carrying out a social network analysis (SNA)
   is a time-consuming task that entails a series of steps in which the
   expert in social network analysis could make mistakes. This research
   presents a multi-domain knowledge model capable of automatically
   gathering data and carrying out different social network analyses in
   different domains, without errors and obtaining the same conclusions
   that an expert in SNA would obtain. The model is represented in an
   ontology called OntoSNAQA, which is made up of classes, properties and
   rules representing the domains of People, Questionnaires and Social
   Network Analysis. Besides the ontology itself, different rules are
   represented by SWRL and SPARQL queries. A Knowledge Based System was
   created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a real case study in order to
   show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the results of an SNA
   analysis obtained through the model were compared to those obtained from
   some of the most widely used SNA applications: UCINET, Pajek, Cytoscape
   and Gephi, to test and confirm the validity of the model. (c) 2020

   Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public
   health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other

   individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in
   publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social
   graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited
   from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence
   of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a
   predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this
   paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding
   framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's
   prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient
   non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in
   graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the

   evolution of the USAID PREDICT project and was presented as a
   ``collaborative scientific initiative to discover zoonotic viral threats
   and stop future pandemics{''}. The immediate response was mixed, with
   public health and scientific communities representatives showing
   skepticism, if not direct opposition.OBJECTIVES The economic, social,
   and health consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   pandemic demonstrated how unprepared the world was in the face of new
   pandemics. This paper analyses the impact of the GVP on the scientific
   and public health communities.METHODS Published scientific articles that
   cited the two 2018 seminal publications proposing the project were
   analysed using social network analysis methods.FINDINGS Encompassing the
   periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results
   indicate that (i) the concepts of the GVP have received more support
   than opposition in the scientific literature; (ii) its foundations
   should be updated to address the specific criticisms.MAIN CONCLUSIONS
   Shifting focus to national virome projects can provide tangible,

   applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current
   challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2
   among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of
   employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as
   common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion,
   like sharing an office or participating in the same management board.
   The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are
   the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to
   be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the
   designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for
   its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been
   demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing
   promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights
   provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the
   Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of

   The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and
   methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for
   preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature

   adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is

  abstract = {Background: Social media provide an ideal medium for breeding and
   reinforcing vaccine hesitancy, especially during public health
   emergencies. Algorithmic recommendation-based technology along with
   users' selective exposure and group pressure lead to online echo
   chambers, causing inefficiency in vaccination promotion. Avoiding or
   breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior.
   Objective: With the ultimate goal of eliminating the impact of echo
   chambers related to vaccine hesitancy on social media during public
   health emergencies, the aim of this study was to develop a framework to
   quantify the echo chamber effect in users' topic selection and attitude
   contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations; detect online opinion
   leaders and structural hole spanners based on network attributes; and
   explore the relationships of their behavior patterns and network
   locations, as well as the relationships of network locations and impact
   on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers.
   Methods: We called the Sina Weibo application programming interface to
   crawl tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user
   information on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Adopting social
   network analysis, we examined the low echo chamber effect based on
   topics in representational networks of information, according to
   attitude in communication flow networks of users under different
   interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual
   analyses were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users
   (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and to explore their
   function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo
   chambers.
   Results: Users showed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic
   selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was
   more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, whereas the opposite
   trend was found for the latter. Speakers, replicators, and monologists
   tended to be opinion leaders, whereas common users, retweeters, and
   networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and
   spanners tended to be ``bridgers{''} to disseminate diverse topics and
   communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes toward COVID-19
   vaccines. Moreover, users who tended to echo a single topic could bridge
   multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also
   tended to serve as bridgers for different attitudes.
   Conclusions: This study not only revealed a low echo chamber effect in
   vaccine hesitancy, but further elucidated the underlying reasons from
   the perspective of users, offering insights for research about the form,
   degree, and formation of echo chambers, along with depolarization,
   social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination
   pattern of topic, and sentiment. Therefore, this work can help to
   provide strategies for public health and public opinion managers to
   cooperate toward avoiding or correcting echo chamber chaos and
   effectively promoting online vaccine campaigns.},

   organizations worldwide, especially as regards the adolescent
   population. The consumption of alcohol in adolescents is known to be
   influenced by seeing friends and even parents drinking alcohol. Building
   on this fact, a number of studies into alcohol consumption among
   adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to
   study the different social networks (peers, friends, family, etc.) with
   whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need an initial

  abstract = {Background: Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus
   disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has led to
   increased discussions across online platforms. These conversations have
   also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst
   them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading
   to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom.
   The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies
   oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the
   drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with
   such misinformation.
   Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content
   analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to
   Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was
   trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were
   analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes
   were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's
   vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore
   algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined.
   Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network
   structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The
   analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who
   was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed
   that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\% (n=81) contained views that 5G and
   COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and
   33.0\% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or
   opinions. Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy
   theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted
   high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy.
   This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web
   source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The
   study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the
   conspiracy theory on Twitter.
   Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions
   oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to
   reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the
   conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets
   inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that

   Top2Vec and BERT to extract topics and sentiments, and used social
   network analysis methods to construct network graphs and compare network

   in information dissemination between posts published by bot users and
   human users through multi-factor ANOVA. It was found that there were
   significant differences in behavioral characteristics and diffusion
   mechanisms between bot users and human users. The findings can help
   guide the public to pay attention to topic shifting and promote the

  abstract = {Emergency information release during public health emergencies is a
   governance measure to slow down the spread of the epidemic and guide the
   public in scientific protection. Because of the uncertainty and
   life-cycle characteristics of public health emergencies, emergency
   information release represents the process of time dynamics. At present,
   it is an inevitable trend to establish a collaborative mechanism for
   emergency information release of public health emergencies to improve
   the release efficiency and respond to public demand. To determine time
   evolution characteristics of organizational collaboration in emergency
   information release, this study took the response to COVID-19 from the
   central government of China as an example and conducted research based
   on social network analysis. Based on information from COVID-19-related
   press conferences held by China's central government, the emergency
   information release collaborative networks (EIRCNs), and Emergency
   Organizations-Emergency Information Release Matters (EOs-EIRMs) 2-mode
   network were constructed. With the time evolution, the tightness,
   convergence, stability, and connectivity of EIRCNs in public health
   emergencies presented the process of lowering and then raising. At
   different stages, the core emergency organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs
   continued to maintain a certain degree of activity. Their dynamic
   processes showed the characteristics of diversification rather than
   homogeneity. The time evolution of emergency information release matters
   (EIRMs) reflected the dynamic adjustment of the government's prevention
   and control measures and responded to the diversification of the
   public's understanding and protection needs during different stages of
   the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further examined the driving factors
   and implementation mechanism of the time evolution characteristics of
   the collaborative mode of emergency information release. The
   implementation of EIRMs at different stages had different resource
   requirements, which were usually achieved by introducing new EOs (Adding
   resource increment) or increasing the collaborative frequencies among
   EOs (Activating resource stock). In addition, further research prospects
   and feasibility interpretation were proposed.},

  abstract = {White-tailed deer (WTD) spread communicable diseases such as the
   coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and
   chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious, brain disease
   occurring in species of the deer family. Currently, it is not well
   understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we
   speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via
   direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at
   scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more
   contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. Using
   social network analysis, we identified potential superspreaders among
   multiple communities of a rural WTD herd in Mississippi. Analysis of age
   structure revealed that the majority of potential super-spreaders were
   young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also compared infection risk
   across the landscape by combining social network analysis and
   heatmapping software to locate disease transmission hotspots, where the
   risk of disease transmission is higher as compared to other locations.
   We also monitored predator and hunting activity and hunter deer harvests
   to better understand how predators influence social networks and
   potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity
   influenced the age structure of male WTD communities. We assessed
   disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter
   harvests or the removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented
   WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall,
   this study demonstrates a model for predicting potential super-spreaders
   of diseases, describes new methods to locate transmission hotspots, and
   provides new knowledge for disease management and prevention strategies.
   White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, WTD) spread communicable
   diseases such the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major
   public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal,
   highly contagious prion disease occurring in cervids. Currently, it is
   not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper,
   we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via
   direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at
   scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more
   contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. In this
   study, we used network analysis from scrape visitation data to identify
   potential super-spreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD
   herd. We combined local network communities to form a large region-wide
   social network consisting of 96 male WTD. Analysis of WTD bachelor
   groups and random network modeling demonstrated that scraping networks
   depict real social networks, allowing detection of direct and indirect
   contacts, which could spread diseases. Using this regional network, we
   model three major types of potential super-spreaders of communicable
   disease: in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness potential
   super-spreaders. We found out-degree and betweenness potential
   super-spreaders to be critical for disease transmission across multiple
   communities. Analysis of age structure revealed that potential
   super-spreaders were mostly young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We
   also used social network analysis to measure the outbreak potential
   across the landscape using a new technique to locate disease
   transmission hotspots. To model indirect transmission risk, we developed
   the first scrape-to-scrape network model demonstrating connectivity of
   scrape sites. Comparing scrape betweenness scores allowed us to locate
   high-risk transmission crossroads between communities. We also monitored
   predator activity, hunting activity, and hunter harvests to better
   understand how predation influences social networks and potential
   disease transmission. We found that predator activity significantly
   influenced the age structure of scraping communities. We assessed
   disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter
   harvests or removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD
   social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this
   study demonstrates a model capable of predicting potential
   super-spreaders of diseases, outlines methods to locate transmission
   hotspots and community crossroads, and provides new insight for disease
   management and outbreak prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 26-min
   documentary entitled Plandemic was released online and fanatically

   citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary
   propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health
   interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in
   conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we
   examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a
   case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By
   comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication
   patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the
   Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the
   campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on
   Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the
   documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its
   misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments
   regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy
   theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the
   public's willingness to comply with public health measures. Our results
   show the necessity of further research about sophisticated social

   parental-health-education is a potential way to reduce child
   unintentional injuries. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms by
   which online-social-network-based health education may reduce the
   unintentional injuries among children aged 0-3 years. MethodsWe
   conducted a participant-blinded, randomized controlled,
   online-social-network-based health-education intervention study from
   March 2019 to February 2020 in Shanghai. We established four WeChat
   groups (two intervention groups and two control groups). For the
   intervention groups, a doctor's assistant regularly delivered
   information regarding unintentional injuries among children, and
   community childcare doctors answered parents' questions concerning their
   children's health, including unintentional injuries. Meanwhile, the
   control groups did not receive any information from the assistant. The
   study selected one intervention group and one control group and compared
   the ego network and whole network indicators to determine the
   differences between the intervention and control groups. ResultsIn the
   intervention and control groups, 64.5\% and 31.9\% of the members,
   respectively, engaged in communication, and 1,736 and 273 records,
   respectively, were obtained. Regarding ego network, the doctor showed
   the largest network in the intervention group, and the size of the
   intervention group's network was twice that of the control group; the
   number of ties in the intervention group was nine times that of the
   control group. Fourteen and four parents in the intervention and control
   group played an active role, respectively. Regarding centrality, all
   WeChat groups were loose and multiple centers existed. Regarding
   subgroup cohesion, the intervention group had 28 cliques with 27
   members, and the control group had 4 cliques with 4 members. For
   structural hole, 23.7\% and 7.5\% members in the intervention and
   control group actively participated in interactions, respectively,
   having strong control and influence over other parents; 69.2\% and
   59.1\% members in the intervention and control group, respectively, had
   values of < 1.000, showing that they had strong ability to cross-jump
   structural holes. DiscussionOnline-social-networks-based health
   education interventions could enhance communication among parents, and
   between parents and community childcare doctors, and also shorten the
   social distance between them. Thus, online-social-network-based
   parental-health-education-intervention can be a feasible and
   generalizable means of preventing unintentional injuries among children.},

   sourcing repertoire. Moreover, the networks were fragmented because the
   sources were clustered into several close-knit subgroups. Analyzing
   exponential random graph models to examine the formation mechanism of
   the networks revealed that, as the pandemic's severity increased,
   influential users played a more salient role in the sourcing repertoire,
   and a homogeneous cluster consisting of journalists and news
   organizations emerged.},

   emergency response techniques. This paper analyzes interactions between
   three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible,

   major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide
   these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public

   three examples from each group. The results show that government control
   of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at
   the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government,
   the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens
   trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make
   cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of

   spreading?},
  journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},

  month = {APR 25},
  abstract = {BackgroundInformation and emotions towards public health issues could
   spread widely through online social networks. Although aggregate metrics
   on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little
   about how information spreads on online social networks. Health
   information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or
   from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim
   of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information
   on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola
   messages.MethodsOur data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all
   Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31,
   2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter
   content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis
   was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to
   describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network
   into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user,
   disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting
   patterns.ResultsOn average, 91\% of the retweets were directly retweeted
   from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5\% of the retweeting paths of
   the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its
   immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting
   was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users
   and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators
   and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the
   viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers
   via influential and hidden influential users.ConclusionsBroadcasting was
   the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event
   on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work
   beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the
   message across, because influential and hidden influential users can
   reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter
   accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users
   can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential
   users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective
   communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges
   remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users.},

   information and misinformation are being shared on Twitter by
   identifying types of social media users who initiate the information
   diffusion process.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed methodology
   approach to analyze tweets with COVID-19-related hashtags. First, a
   social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who
   initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative
   content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to
   identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and
   disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings
   Results - found very little misinformation and disinformation
   distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual
   COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum
   engagement. Tweets by citizens focusing on personal experience or
   opinions received more retweets and likes compared to any other sender
   type. Similarly, celebrities received more replies than any other sender
   type.
   Practical implications - This study helps medical experts and government
   agencies understand the type of COVID-19 content and communication being
   shared on social media for population health purposes.
   Originality/value - This study offers insight into how social media
   users engage with COVID-19-related information on Twitter and offers a
   typology of categories of information shared about the pandemic.

   also exists in provincial financial departments. The supervision
   departments typically adopt the inter-functional pattern at all levels.
   At the cross-level and cross-function aspects, the hybrid interaction
   pattern prevails in the medical function and plays a fair part in the
   security, welfare, and economic function. This study is one of the first
   to summarize the interaction patterns in a multi-level setting,

   Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of
   tribal organization participation in public health networks and to
   understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal
   organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models
   estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified
   random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574
   respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also
   surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request
   of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were
   restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska
   Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of
   258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN
   serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations
   participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented
   public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more
   comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services
   participating in the network and the scope of public health activities
   implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The
   likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of
   the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian
   Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to
   reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public
   health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even
   when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of
   tribal organizations remains low.},

   METHODS Publication data on electronic cigarettes from 2010 to 2018 were
   retrieved and downloaded from the PubMed database. Theme trends and
   knowledge structures were analyzed on the relevant research fields of
   electronic cigarettes by using a biclustering analysis, strategic
   diagram analysis, and social network analysis methods. Research hotspots
   were extracted and compared from three periods.
   RESULTS Core topics that have continuously develop between the years
   2010 and 2018 include: tobacco use cessation devices; tobacco products;
   tobacco use cessation devices/adverse effects; smoking prevention and
   adverse effects; electronic nicotine delivery systems/economics; and
   public health. Some currently undeveloped topics that could be
   considered as new future research directions include: tobacco use
   disorder/therapy; tobacco use disorder/epidemiology;
   students/psychology; students/statistics and numerical data; adolescent

  abstract = {Community detection in social networks is the process of identifying the
   cohesive groups of similar nodes. Detection of these groups can be
   helpful in many applications, such as finding networks of protein
   interaction in biological networks, finding the users of similar mind
   for ads and suggestions, finding a shared research field in
   collaborative networks, analyzing public health, future link prediction
   in social networks, analyzing criminology, and many more. However, with
   the increase in the number of profiles and content shared on social
   media platforms, the analysis is often time-consuming and exhaustive. In
   order to speed up and optimize the community detection process, parallel
   processing and Shared/Distributed memory techniques are widely used.
   Despite community detection has widespread use in social networks, no
   attempt has ever been made to compile and systematically discuss
   research efforts on the emerging subject of identifying parallel and
   distributed methods for community detection in social networks. Most of
   the surveys described the serial algorithms used for community
   detection. Our survey work comes under the scope of new design
   techniques, exciting or novel applications, components or standards, and
   applications of an educational, transactional, and co-operational
   nature. This paper accommodates and presents a systematic literature
   review with state-of-the-art research on the application of parallel
   processing and Shared/Distributed techniques to determine communities
   for social network analysis. Advanced search strategy has been performed
   on several digital libraries for extracting several studies for the
   review. The systematic search landed in finding 3220 studies, among
   which 65 relevant studies are selected after conducting various
   screening phases for further review. The application of parallel
   computing, shared memory, and distributed memory on the existing
   community detection methodologies have been discussed thoroughly. More
   specifically, the central significance of this paper is that a

   considerable attention recently. In this paper, we focused on a large
   set of patient referral data gathered in Fujian province, China, between
   2009 and 2011. We built a directed weighted patient referral network. By
   using four metrics from network science, namely, the power-law
   distribution, global rich-club coefficient, local rich-club coefficient,
   and assortativity coefficient, we identified a significant rich-club
   phenomenon in this network. In addition, the community detection was
   also carried out to find the relationship between rich members and
   non-rich members. The findings indicate an oligopoly in which Class-III
   hospitals occupy an overwhelmingly dominant position over the
   competition. Also, the characteristic `significant regional clustering'

  abstract = {Using Twitter to implement public health awareness campaigns is on the
   rise, but campaign monitoring and evaluation are largely dependent on
   basic Twitter Analytics. To establish the potential of social network
   theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we
   analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World
   Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis
   (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as
   topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign
   participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months
   pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships
   during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times
   compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants
   formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their
   geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background.
   While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were
   disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did
   mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a
   ``bridging{''} role between the public and the scientific community.
   Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also
   discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial
   inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding
   campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and
   influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting
   to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar
   case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform
   other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go
   beyond traditional metrics.},

   Behavior Change: Descriptive Analysis},
  journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},

  month = {JUL 20},
  abstract = {Background: Obesity is one of the greatest modern public health
   problems, due to the associated health and economic consequences.
   Decreased physical activity is one of the main societal changes driving
   the current obesity pandemic. Objective: Our goals are to fill a gap in
   the literature and study whether users organically utilize a social
   media platform, Twitter, for providing motivation. We examine the topics
   of messages and social network structures on Twitter. We discuss social
   media's potential for providing peer support and then draw insights to
   inform the development of interventions for long-term health-related
   behavior change.
   Methods: We examined motivational messages related to physical activity
   on Twitter. First, we collected tweets related to physical activity.
   Second, we analyzed them using (1) a lexicon-based approach to extract
   and characterize motivation-related tweets, (2) a thematic analysis to
   examine common themes in retweets, and (3) topic models to understand
   prevalent factors concerning motivation and physical activity on
   Twitter. Third, we created 2 social networks to investigate organically
   arising peer-support network structures for sustaining physical activity
   and to form a deeper understanding of the feasibility of these networks
   in a real-world context.
   Results: We collected over 1.5 million physical activity-related tweets
   posted from August 30 to November 6, 2018. A relatively small percentage
   of the tweets mentioned the term motivation; many of these were made on
   Mondays or during morning or late morning hours. The analysis of
   retweets showed that the following three themes were commonly conveyed
   on the platform: (1) using a number of different types of motivation
   (self, process, consolation, mental, or quotes), (2) promoting
   individuals or groups, and (3) sharing or requesting information. Topic
   models revealed that many of these users were weightlifters or people
   trying to lose weight. Twitter users also naturally forged relations,
   even though 98.12\% (2824/2878) of these users were in different
   physical locations.
   Conclusions: This study fills a knowledge gap on how individuals
   organically use social media to encourage and sustain physical activity.
   Elements related to peer support are found in the organic use of social
   media. Our findings suggest that geographical location is less important
   for providing peer support as long as the support provides motivation,
   despite users having few factors in common (eg, the weather) affecting
   their physical activity. This presents a unique opportunity to identify
   successful motivation-providing peer support groups in a large user
   base. However, further research on the effects in a real-world context,
   as well as additional design and usability features for improving user
   engagement, are warranted to develop a successful intervention
   counteracting the current obesity pandemic. This is especially important
   for young adults, the main user group for social media, as they develop
   lasting health-related behaviors.},

  abstract = {Introduction Tobacco harm reduction (THR) discourse has been divisive
   for the tobacco control community, partially because it sometimes aligns
   public health and tobacco industry interests. Industry funding is
   contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed
   in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed
   and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network
   analysis. Methods We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts
   (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry
   (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including
   government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network
   analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by
   assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the
   frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to
   form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of
   funding, and THR stance. Results About 284 (20\%) out of 1405 authors
   were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central
   and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median
   = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and
   higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more
   influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors.
   E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association
   with undisclosed industry support. Conclusions Authors with industry
   support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse
   than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering
   to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An
   increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be
   necessary to achieve funding parity.},

   this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in
   primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021.
   As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused
   on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2
   diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure
   (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of
   connections, density and centralization for each of the health
   conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive
   findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in
   primary care practices.
   Results: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25
   practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of
   information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic
   diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected
   networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low
   hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with
   low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17
   for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information
   sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members.
   Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with
   nurses and pharmacists.
   Conclusions: This study identified four types of information exchange
   structures, which provides a practical tool for management and
   improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer
   connections and could hardly be considered a network.},

   highest caseload in the state (229, 20\%), but comparatively low cluster
   formation. Thirty-four (2.96\%) `super-spreaders' (outdegree > 5) caused
   60\% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can
   allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint
   key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for
   rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially
   achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.},

   Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic
   consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the
   development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a
   social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three
   distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance
   in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few
   repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity
   across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies.
   We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from
   infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical
   relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social
   network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness
   of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide
   scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied
   in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences

   The P-value of .001 for both prediction models confirmed a meaningful

  abstract = {Author summarySchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases
   which is planned for elimination by 2030. Eliminating the disease
   requires collaboration among important government, community, healthcare
   providers and non-governmental organizations representatives working on
   schistosomiasis. The current level of cooperation and collaboration
   among these representatives in Oyo state, Nigeria is unknown. This study
   aimed to measure the extent and strength of collaboration among these
   representatives looking at three relationships: contact, collaboration
   and resource sharing activities using social network analysis method.
   Undertaking this research will support a better understanding of
   barriers against meeting the disease elimination deadline. The social
   network analysis found that the three relationships patterns had
   considerable clustering among representatives and few connections,
   signifying low interconnectedness across several representative groups.
   The contact and collaborative relationships were the most active, with
   the resource-sharing network having the lowest amount of
   interconnectedness. Representatives were more active in rural areas than
   urban, and representatives in the organized government and the public
   health system were the most active actors in the schistosomiasis control
   program. The schistosomiasis control program's representative's poor
   connectedness, unbalanced relationships patterns should be addressed in
   order to stimulate improvement and reach the WHO schistosomiasis
   elimination objective.
   BackgroundSchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases
   targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease elimination requires
   collaboration between stakeholders, country ownership and the
   involvement of community-level stakeholders. The state of stakeholder
   relationship determines the ease and timeliness of meeting disease
   elimination targets. Mapping stakeholder relationships is critical for
   assessing gaps in the schistosomiasis control program implementation,
   and providing a roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study
   aimed to measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and
   resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo state,
   Nigeria. Materials and methodsThis study used a Network Representative
   design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The study was conducted within
   Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North
   (urban) and Akinyele (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a
   link-tracing approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from
   stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare, academia,
   and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed using Gephi
   software for network cohesion across the three networks. ResultsThe
   social network analysis revealed high clustering and low density across
   the three networks implying low cohesion across multiple stakeholder
   categories. The contact and collaborative networks were the most active
   with the lowest level of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network.
   Stakeholders were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and
   stakeholders within the organized governance and public health system
   were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control program.
   ConclusionThe low cohesion, high clustering and low network density
   among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis control program should be
   addressed in other to drive innovation and meet the WHO schistosomiasis
   elimination target.},

   multisectoral network that emerged and evolved under strong state
   control during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory

   focuses on the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties
   in the network. The data for the study were collected through a content
   analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network
   analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized
   structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the
   central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations
   rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal
   ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and
   nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of
   structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the
   peak period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the
   centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally be
   conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health disasters,
   calling for a careful design of governance structures for disaster

   product trade data from 2000 to 2018 and employing social network
   analysis, this paper explores the unbalanced pattern of global vaccine
   product trade and assesses the sensitivity interdependence between
   countries. Overall, the analysis shows that global vaccine product trade
   links have long been highly concentrated within developed countries in
   Europe and America. Nevertheless, with the rise of global and regional
   hub countries, the global vaccine product trade network has begun to
   evolve from a unipolar structure with the U.S. as the sole core to a
   multipolar structure with the U.S. and Western European countries as the
   core. Meanwhile, emerging countries, represented by China and India, are
   increasingly participating in the global vaccine product trade network
   and are beginning to play an important role. The formation of this
   multipolar pattern has provided countries in the Global South with more
   options for cooperation in the vaccine product trade and reduces the
   sensitivity inter-dependence of network periphery countries on core
   countries, which consequently reduces the global supply risk of vaccine
   products.},

   Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for
   numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In
   this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification
   using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple
   intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The
   objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and
   natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto
   a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over
   time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of
   conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine
   emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association
   classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for
   classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in
   research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our
   analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of
   behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human
   relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect
   interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85\%. The evaluation
   shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from
   conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex
   relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in
   emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time.},

   concern amongst scholars, health agencies and governments owing to its
   potential harms to public health. This article addresses the question of
   how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19
   facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After
   reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our
   analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of
   COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health
   professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the
   capacities of `actor-actants' and `issue-actants,' and between the
   adoption of `field' and `contested' hashtags during a controversy. We
   identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts
   such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and
   researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these
   actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these
   categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or
   retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of
   Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to
   facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as \#hydroxychloroquine attracted
   significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that
   they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed
   them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the
   `echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy
   implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in
   health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting
   misinformation.},

   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the most common issues
   posted by users and temporal analysis to research the issue's trend.
   Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to discover the opinion leader
   on the two different platforms. Finally, we find that online discourse

   users of Weibo pay more attention to public health. The issues focused

   the spread of misinformation. Some researchers anticipate benefits
   stemming from improved public awareness of the value of vaccines while
   others worry concerns around vaccine development and public health
   mandates may have damaged public trust. There is a need to understand
   whether the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine mandates
   have influenced HPV vaccine attitudes and sentiments to inform health
   communication strategies.MethodsWe collected 596,987 global
   English-language tweets from January 2019-May 2021 using Twitter's
   Academic Research Product track. We determined vaccine confident and
   hesitant networks discussing HPV immunization using social network
   analysis. Then, we used a neural network approach to natural language
   processing to measure narratives and sentiment pertaining to HPV
   immunization.ResultsMost of the tweets in the vaccine hesitant network
   were negative in tone (54.9\%) and focused on safety concerns
   surrounding the HPV vaccine while most of the tweets in the vaccine
   confident network were neutral (51.6\%) and emphasized the health
   benefits of vaccination. Growth in negative sentiment among the vaccine
   hesitant network corresponded with legislative efforts in the State of
   New York to mandate HPV vaccination for public school students in 2019
   and the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a Global Health Emergency in
   2020. In the vaccine confident network, the number of tweets concerning
   the HPV vaccine decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic but in both
   vaccine hesitant and confident networks, the sentiments, and themes of
   tweets about HPV vaccine were unchanged.ConclusionsAlthough we did not
   observe a difference in narratives or sentiments surrounding the HPV
   vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased focus on
   the HPV vaccine among vaccine confident groups. As routine vaccine
   catch-up programs restart, there is a need to invest in health
   communication online to raise awareness about the benefits and safety of
   the HPV vaccine.},

  abstract = {The correct management of diseases that are transmitted between wildlife

   The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to
   its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles
   for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic
   network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using
   information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven
   fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored
   using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16
   proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social
   network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions,
   including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of
   different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within
   this network. The results show a high connection between species through
   indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of
   new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities
   that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission
   of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be
   playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock.
   The present work shows the need to consider different types of
   methodologies in order to understand the complete functioning of the
   network of interactions at the wildlife/livestock interface. It also
   provides a methodological approach applicable to the management of

   cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to
   occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of
   cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the
   community department for education and sports being the most central
   network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of
   organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and
   reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant
   mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical

   The results show that: (1) the ECN has changed from concentrated to

   organizations that at the central position in all phases of emergency

   organization of the ECN mainly comes from government organizations. The
   research results reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks

   to guide emergency management of public health emergencies. In actual

   adjusted based on the characteristics of the emergency situation at
   different stages, comprehensively using the advantages of the
   concentrated and decentralized emergency network. In addition,
   communication between different types of organizations such as
   governments, research institutions, and enterprises should be
   strengthened, and channels for diversified organizations to participate
   in emergency communication should be set up. The research helps to
   improve communication between emergency response organizations and is of
   great significance to controlling and reducing the harm caused by public

   Excessive alcohol consumption in adolescents is one of the most
   significant public health problems currently facing society. Social and
   geographical contexts contribute to the development of alcohol-related
   behavior in adolescents. The aim of this research is to analyze the
   social pattern related to alcohol consumption in adolescents based on

   Methodology
   We designed a descriptive cross-sectional study based on social network
   analysis. We recruited 196 high school students between 16 and 18 years
   of age to participate in the study. The methodology applied was social
   network analysis by means of transitivity and homophily social triads.
   The data were analyzed using STATA statistical software.
   Results and conclusions
   A total of 58.48\% of rural adolescents consumed alcohol compared to
   49.52\% of urban adolescents. These results demonstrate that adolescents
   who live in rural areas exhibit a greater risk of drinking alcohol than
   those who live in urban areas. The presence of transitive triads
   increases the probability of sharing sociodemographic attributes in such
   a way that it may be considered one of the causes of homophily,
   contributing to adolescents taking greater risks, such as consuming
   alcohol.},

  abstract = {Human population expansion into wildlife habitats has increased interest
   in the behavioural ecology of human-wildlife interactions. To date,
   however, the socioecological factors that determine whether, when or
   where wild animals take risks by interacting with humans and
   anthropogenic factors still remains unclear. We adopt a comparative
   approach to address this gap, using social network analysis (SNA). SNA,
   increasingly implemented to determine human impact on wildlife ecology,
   can be a powerful tool to understand how animal socioecology influences
   the spatiotemporal distribution of human-wildlife interactions. For 10
   groups of rhesus, long-tailed and bonnet macaques (Macaca spp.) living
   in anthropogenically impacted environments in Asia, we collected data on
   human-macaque interactions, animal demographics, and macaque-macaque
   agonistic and affiliative social interactions. We constructed `human
   co-interaction networks' based on associations between macaques that
   interacted with humans within the same time and spatial locations, and
   social networks based on macaque-macaque allogrooming behaviour,
   affiliative behaviours of short duration (agonistic support,
   lip-smacking, silent bare-teeth displays and non-sexual mounting) and
   proximity. Pre-network permutation tests revealed that, within all
   macaque groups, specific individuals jointly took risks by repeatedly,
   consistently co-interacting with humans within and across time and
   space. GLMMs revealed that macaques' tendencies to co-interact with
   humans was positively predicted by their tendencies to engage in
   short-duration affiliative interactions and tolerance of conspecifics,
   although the latter varied across species (bonnets>rhesus>long-tailed).
   Male macaques were more likely to co-interact with humans than females.
   Neither macaques' grooming relationships nor their dominance ranks
   predicted their tendencies to co-interact with humans. Our findings
   suggest that, in challenging anthropogenic environments, less (compared
   to more) time-consuming forms of affiliation, and additionally greater
   social tolerance in less ecologically flexible species with a shorter
   history of exposure to humans, may be key to animals' joint propensities
   to take risks to gain access to resources. For males, greater
   exploratory tendencies and less energetically demanding long-term
   life-history strategies (compared to females) may also influence such
   joint risk-taking. From conservation and public health perspectives,
   wildlife connectedness within such co-interaction networks may inform
   interventions to mitigate zoonosis, and move human-wildlife interactions
   from conflict towards coexistence.},

  abstract = {Background Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus2(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate basic
   epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also be
   potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the
   individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on
   different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact
   tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network
   analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission
   dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed
   SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data
   set with diagnosed patients as ``nodes{''} and their epidemiological
   contact as ``edges{''} was created. Directed network perspective was
   utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a ``source
   patient{''} towards a ``target patient{''}. Network measures of ``degree
   centrality{''} and ``betweenness centrality{''} were calculated to
   identify influential patients in the transmission of infection.
   Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub-
   groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures
   and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results
   Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959
   patients, 11.27\% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to
   40.19\% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12)
   patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have
   collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients.
   Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93) patients
   had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the
   transmission between other patients. Network component analysis
   identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential
   patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95\% of total patients
   (1959) and 68.74\% of epidemiological contacts in the network.
   Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact
   tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level
   variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified
   individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately
   contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools
   could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help
   improve the contact tracing activities.},

   techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how
   this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag
   virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among
   Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users
   with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early
   days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far
   right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this
   hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their
   followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local
   hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the

  abstract = {Background: Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper
   suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on
   coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles
   founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of
   scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public
   health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of
   this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify
   critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions.
   We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in
   implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of
   developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the
   EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access
   to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their
   associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a
   theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories:
   conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of
   our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques
   (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results:
   Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated
   the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to
   public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the
   United States and China were the primary contributors to global
   coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated
   that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a
   secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong
   between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven
   approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and
   relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policy
   makers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their
   decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for
   effective health responses.},

  journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
  year = {2019},

  month = {APR 16},
  abstract = {Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health
   challenge worldwide. Implementing policies to cope with this challenge
   requires commitment from all stakeholders at various levels, and all
   necessary resources should be mobilised. Support for various HCV-related
   stakeholders can reduce the challenges and obstacles that can be
   encountered during the programme implementation. The present study aims
   to identify all stakeholders involved with HCV-related policy-making in
   Iran at different steps (policy development, implementation and
   evaluation) and to characterise them in terms of interest, position,
   power and influence, in order to provide valuable information for
   appropriate decision-making and design. The present study can also serve
   as a case study for healthcare systems in other countries.
   Method: An approach based on social network analysis was utilised. Data
   collected included relevant document searches and in-depth interviews to
   a sample of 18 key informants.
   Results: Various stakeholders were found to be involved with HCV-related
   policies in Iran. The extent of their participation and support in
   policy-making varied. Specifically, international agencies had a high
   interest for HCV-related policy-making, whereas media and members of the
   private sector were characterised by a medium interest and governmental
   and non-governmental bodies by a highly variable interest, ranging from
   low to high, depending on the specific organism. Moreover, media and
   members of the private sector, non-governmental institutions and
   international agencies were rated low in terms of position, whereas
   governmental actors were rated low to high. Media were rated medium in
   terms of power, whereas international agencies and members of the
   private sector were respectively rated low to medium and low.
   Non-governmental actors were rated low, whilst governmental bodies were
   rated low to high. Finally, media, members of the private sector and
   international agencies were rated medium in terms of influence, whereas
   non-governmental and governmental actors were respectively rated low to
   medium and low to high.
   Conclusion: Policy-making involves trust, negotiation and integration of
   the different views of all stakeholders. Social network analysis was
   critical for identifying stakeholders and showing that, in Iran,
   involvement in HCV-related policy-making is generally low. This
   information is of practical implication for policy- and decision-makers
   regarding the adoption of more favourable and effective strategies.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesOn February 6th, 2023, a doublet earthquake struck Turkiye,
   impacting more than 15 million people including migrants, and resulting
   in over 50,000 deaths. The Syrian migrants experience multiple
   uncertainties in their daily lives which are further compounded by
   multifaceted challenges of the post-disaster environment. Social media
   was used intensively and with impunity in this environment and thereby
   provides a window into the explicit and implicit dynamics of daily life
   after a disaster. We aimed to explore how a post-disaster environment
   potentially generates new uncertainties or exacerbating pre-existing
   ones for migrants through social media analysis with an indirect
   perspective, in the context of 2023-Earthquake in Turkiye and Syrian
   migrants. MethodsSocial network analysis was used to analyze
   Twitter-data with the hashtags `Syrian' and `earthquake' during a 10-day
   period beginning on March 22nd, 2023. We calculated network metrics,
   including degree-values and betweenness-centrality and clustered the
   network to understand groups. We analyzed a combination of 27 tweets
   with summative content analysis using a text analysis tool, to identify
   the most frequently used words. We identified the main points of each
   tweet and assessed these as possible contributors to post-disaster
   uncertainty among migrants by using inductive reasoning. ResultsThere
   were 1918 Twitter users, 274 tweets, 124 replies and 1726 mentions.
   Discussions about Syrian migrants and earthquakes were established
   across various groups (n(groups(edges > 15)) = 16). Certain users had a
   greater influence on the overall network. The nine most frequently used
   words were included under uncertainty-related category
   (n(most\_frequently\_used\_words) = 20); `aid, vote, house, citizen,
   Afghan, illegal, children, border, and leave'. Nine main points were
   identified as possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants.
   ConclusionThe post-disaster environment has the potential to exacerbate
   existing uncertainties, such as being an undocumented migrant, concerns
   about deportation and housing, being or having a child, inequality of
   rights between being a citizen and non-citizen, being in minority within
   minority, political climate of the host nation and access to education
   or to generate new ones such equitable distribution of aid, which can
   lead to poor health outcomes. Recognizing the possible post-disaster
   uncertainties among migrants and addressing probable underlying factors
   might help to build more resilient and healthy communities.},

   Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the

   individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion
   behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals
   and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger
   National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine
   tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal
   disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed
   us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of
   interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three
   prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised
   degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between
   pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other,
   a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in
   dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so,
   within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear

   transmission models are frequently unavailable and may overlook
   community intrinsic dynamics that impact TB transmission. Social network
   analysis (SNA) generates data on hyperlocal social-demographic
   structures that contribute to disease transmission.MethodsWe collected
   social contact data in five villages and built SNA-informed
   village-specific stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar.
   A name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact
   networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by
   snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were
   aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and individual-level
   characteristics determining contact formation and structure were
   identified by fitting an exponential random graph model (ERGM), which
   formed the basis of the contact structure and model dynamics. Models
   were calibrated and used to evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and
   community resiliency to foreign TB introduction.ResultsInter- and
   intra-village SNA showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with
   transitivity (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43.
   Active case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active
   TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all
   village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and without
   specific interventions, networks A and B showed resilience to both
   active and latent TB reintroduction, while Network C, the village
   network with the highest transitivity, lacked resiliency to
   reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence of 2\% and a TB mortality
   rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one new contagious infection post
   hypothetical elimination.ConclusionIn remote Madagascar, SNA-informed
   models suggest that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease
   (active TB) prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB)
   burden remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction
   decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down{''}

   latest developments in this field to improve the ability of public
   health emergency management in various countries. This paper took 5,143
   related studies from 2007 to 2020 from the Web of Science as research
   object and used CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and other software to perform
   co-word analysis, social network analysis, and cluster analysis. The
   results and conclusions were as follows: (1) the related research
   identified three periods: the exploration, growth, and outbreak period;
   (2) chronologically: the relevant research evolved from medical and
   health care for major diseases to emergency management and risk
   assessment of public health emergencies and then researched the novel
   coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia epidemic; (3) clustering analysis of
   high-frequency keywords, identifying three research hotspots: ``disaster
   prevention and emergency medical services,{''} ``outbreak and management
   of infectious diseases in Africa,{''} and ``emergency management under
   the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic.{''} Finally, this study combined the
   data and literature analysis to point out possible future research
   directions: from the research of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic to the
   research of general major public health emergencies, thinking and
   remodeling of the national public health emergency management system,
   and exploring the establishment of an efficient international emergency
   management cooperation mechanism.},

   sequencing (WGS) to test for general patterns of contagious spread of a
   mycobacterial infection for which pathways of disease acquisition are
   not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with
   avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430
   birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through
   mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional
   methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium
   (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of
   mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across
   bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the
   source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases
   during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations
   between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as
   determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide
   polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly
   generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes
   clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were
   dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected
   birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant
   (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but
   not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed
   genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by
   chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were
   identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the
   WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their
   host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of
   connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a
   contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.},

  journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE},

  abstract = {Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an important
   role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors. Methodological advances permit
   simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and
   joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and
   studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include
   contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data;
   or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an
   eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual
   contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary
   parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta
   parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified
   models are also used to understand how each context may matter
   differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534
   females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and
   traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full
   and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups,
   schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%,
   respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do
   not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge
   as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in
   adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both
   methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model
   contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in
   youth alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention
   strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer
   networks.},

  year = {2023},
  volume = {245},
  month = {2023 APR 1},
  abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose deaths are often geographically discordant
   (the community in which the overdose death occurs is different from the
   community of residence). Thus, in many cases there is a journey to
   overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine
   characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 \%
   of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study.
   First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs
   (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant
   overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which
   journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and
   characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used
   temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent,
   sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we
   identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus
   non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower
   housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated
   relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more
   likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be
   authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved
   fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be
   accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other
   than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of
   suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to
   overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in
   metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.},

   despite a steady decline in the number of individual prescriptions
   directing >= 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day may be
   explained by patient exposures to redundant prescriptions from multiple
   prescribers.ObjectivesWe evaluated prescribers' specialty and social
   network characteristics associated with high-risk opioid exposures
   resulting from single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.DesignRetrospective cohort
   study.ParticipantsA cohort of prescribers with opioid analgesic
   prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users in an Illinois
   Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016.Main MeasuresPer prescriber
   rates of single-prescriber high-daily-dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.Key ResultsFor 2280 beneficiaries,
   36,798 opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers.
   Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\%
   of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted
   for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions
   (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following
   specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared
   to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence
   interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and
   surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis
   identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume
   pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of
   predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians.
   Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected
   sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk
   exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's
   periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing
   than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing
   discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated
   practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and
   integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to
   specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential
   policy implications.},

   RESULTS: The following six thematic clusters with a social map were
   extracted: Initial response of the healthcare system, response to
   probabilistic risks after the hazard, response to mental health and
   community resilience, response to public health, response to
   post-traumatic stress disorders, and staff's response to the needs
   assessment and continuity of diagnostic treatment services. Moreover,

  abstract = {Homeless youth experience all types of violence at higher rates than
   their housed counterparts. This is typically the result of many
   contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma,

   living on the streets. Reducing violence in the lives of homeless youth
   is imperative and can contribute to a young person's ability to safely
   and successfully exit the streets and lead a long and productive life in
   society. However, developing public health and social interventions to
   reduce violence in adolescent and young adult populations is difficult
   due to the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of this
   phenomenon. Los Angeles area homeless youth (N = 366) were asked
   questions regarding recent violence experiences, emotion regulation, and
   their social network. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the
   overall effect of emotion regulation on violence, controlling for age,
   gender, race, sexual identity, experience of childhood abuse, and data
   collection site. In this sample, 56\% of youth endorsed fighting in the
   previous year, and those who reported more difficulties with emotion
   regulation were significantly more likely to fight. In addition, youth
   who scored below the mean on difficulties with regulation and belonged
   to networks characterized by low-difficulty peers were 60\% less likely
   to report fighting. Emotion regulation skills represent a malleable
   target for intervention that may contribute to reduced propensity for

  abstract = {IntroductionThe natural disasters and climate anomalies caused by
   increasing global carbon emissions have seriously threatened public
   health. To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems,
   the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of
   peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. The low-carbon patent
   application is an important means to achieve these goals and promote
   public health. MethodsThis study analyzes the basic situation, spatial
   network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in
   China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using
   social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent
   database. ResultsThe following findings are established. (1) From the
   number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon
   patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of
   applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central
   and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing.
   (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed
   a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the
   eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The
   weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon
   patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including
   economic development, financial support, local scientific research
   level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level,
   the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with
   the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic
   development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology
   import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated
   with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban
   agglomerations. DiscussionThis study provides ideas for the construction
   and governance of low-carbon technology innovation system and
   perspectives for theoretical research on public health and high-quality
   development in China.},

   modeling, social network analysis {[}SNA], and network analysis {[}NA])
   applied to domestic or gender-based violence, including victimization,

   review to identify papers meeting our inclusion criteria (i.e.,
   peer-reviewed journal article or published book chapter that described a
   systems science approach to domestic or gender-based violence, broadly
   defined) and assessed the quality and transparency of each
   study.ResultsOur search yielded 1,841 studies, and 74 studies met our
   inclusion criteria (45 SNA, 12 NA, 8 ABM, and 3 SD). Although research
   aims varied across study types, the included studies highlighted social
   network influences on risks for domestic violence, clustering of risk
   factors and violence experiences, and potential targets for
   intervention. We assessed the quality of the included studies as
   moderate, though only a minority adhered to best practices in model
   development and dissemination, including stakeholder engagement and
   sharing of model code.ConclusionsSystems science approaches for the
   study of domestic and gender-based violence have shed light on the
   complex processes that characterize domestic violence and its broader

   portal and it helps users effectively navigate the portal. This study
   examines a subject directory system related to Mental Health in the
   MedlinePlus portal and provides suggestions of optimisation to enhance
   the subject directory system.
   Method. A mixed research method combining social network analysis and
   inferential statistics was applied.
   Analysis. A structural and a semantic social network were built
   regarding the selected health topics related to mental health in the
   MedlinePlus portal. The two networks were compared and the outcomes were
   evaluated by domain experts.
   Results. Among the ninety-nine collected health topics related to mental
   health, three themes were identified through the visualisation analysis
   regarding grouped health topics. Patterns and characteristics of each
   theme group were discussed. As a result, fifty-five bidirectional and
   twenty-three unidirectional edges were identified and recommended to be
   added to the corresponding health topic pages. The recommended results
   indicate that the subject directory of specific mental health related
   topics is well constructed, while health consumer groups related topics
   might need more improvements. The optimised subject directory has
   significantly stronger semantic connection, and the results of the
   recommendations are consistent with the evaluation outcome of two domain
   experts.
   Conclusions. The findings of this study can provide ideas of optimising
   and enhancing the subject directory system to the public health portal
   creators and health professionals, and benefit health consumers for
   seeking health information online. The methodologies applied in this
   study may provide a novel way to investigate and enhance subject
   directories in general.},

  abstract = {Background: Stakeholder participation optimizes health planning,
   fostering the acceptability and integration of new health services.
   Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing challenges in the
   development, implementation and evaluation of community pharmacy
   services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the foundation for building
   collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care.
   Objectives: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a
   collaborative initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing
   cardiovascular diseases in Andalucia (Spain). It aimed to identify
   stakeholders, differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder
   relationships.
   Method: Stakeholders were identified using the snowballing technique. To
   differentiate/categorize stakeholders and analyze the relationships
   (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire was sent to 186
   stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest
   and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity
   to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5)
   concerns; (6) whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level
   of collaboration they had with other stakeholders. Data analysis
   combined descriptive qualitative content analysis, descriptive
   quantitative analysis and social network analysis.
   Results: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated.
   The identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals,
   organizations or collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven
   stakeholders were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most
   participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were willing to
   collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public health and science
   were the main driving interests. A collaboration network existed between
   the 96 stakeholders.
   Conclusion: This study revealed the magnitude of the social system
   surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular

   spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial
   burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for
   contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic
   case-control study and to validate health care network changes during
   pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on
   hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with
   matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1
   year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links
   joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over
   time.
   Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths
   of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care
   providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in
   the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of the network at one
   campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many
   roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.
   Conclusions: Only the network animation over time revealed possible
   transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes
   measured in the traditional case control study. (C) 2019 Association for

   However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen
   transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used
   Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within
   two secondary schools in England and test for associations between
   self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain
   collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact
   survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through
   self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates
   from the local community were also sequenced to assess the
   representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked
   transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and
   social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools
   is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found
   no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission,
   increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age
   children may be an important source of community transmission.},

   associated with perceived success and satisfaction in a health coalition
   and determine significant factors related to organizational
   collaborations. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the
   Olympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition (OPHCC) which aims to
   prevent chronic disease in rural Clallam County, Washington.
   Representatives (n = 21) from member organizations (n = 18) were asked
   to report on organization characteristics, perceived satisfaction in
   coalition activities, perceived success toward coalition's mission, and
   collaborations with other organizations in the coalition. Multilevel
   modeling used to analyze whether an organization's position within the
   coalition network was associated with their perceived satisfaction and
   perceived success. Exponential random graph modeling was used to examine
   what factors may impact collaboration ties between coalition members.
   Findings Organization representatives reported a total of 252
   collaboration ties. In multilevel models, organization characteristics
   and network centrality scores accounted for between 61 and 68\% of
   variance displayed in satisfaction scores and 45-61\% of variance in
   perceived success scores. Exponential random graph modeling revealed
   activity level, for-profit status, and transitivity as significant
   factors in collaborative tie presence. Originality/value Encouraging
   consistent active participation, a balance of organizational type, and
   projects which require more than two collaborators may provide an
   environment for collaborative ties between organizations.},

   individual-level descriptive studies, which are known to have limited
   impact on population PA levels. Leveraging systems science methods
   offers opportunities to approach PA in a manner which embraces its
   inherent complexity. This study describes how participatory systems
   mapping and social network analysis (SNA) were used to understand the
   work of local and national level walking systems in Ireland. Methods Two
   adapted participatory action research workshops with multisectoral
   stakeholders were used to develop a systems map for walking in Cork,
   Ireland. The Global Action Plan for Physical Activity 2018-2030 (GAPPA)
   map was used as a framework to categorize workshop outcomes. Secondly,
   SNA methods were used to analyse the communication network between
   partners of Get Ireland Walking, a national walking promotion
   initiative, as defined within their strategic plan and the actual
   communication network as experienced by the partners. Results The
   systems mapping process allowed stakeholders to identify 19 suggested
   actions for the Cork walking system. The SNA found that there were
   considerably fewer communication ties between partners in the actual
   communication network than in the strategy defined network. Conclusion
   The systems mapping process was a useful catalyst for engaging
   stakeholders in cross-sectoral communication and the GAPPA was a
   practical way to organize workshop outcomes. Social network analysis
   methods highlighted that the communication network of a national level
   walking promotion partnership is not working as planned. Overall, the
   use of systems science methods can provide practical insights for local

   (overweight+obese) and to analyse the structure of the social network of
   friendship established in adolescents doing group sports, using
   different parameters indicative of centrality. Setting It was carried
   out in an educational environment, in 11 classrooms belonging to 5
   Schools in Ponferrada (Spain). Participants 235 adolescents were
   included in the study (49.4\% female), who were classified as normal
   weight or overweight. Primary and secondary outcome measures Physical
   Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used to study the
   level of physical activity. A social network analysis was carried out to
   analyse structural variables of centrality in different degrees of
   contact. Results 30.2\% of the participants in our study were
   overweight. Relative to female participants in this study, males
   obtained significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A (OR: 2.11; 95\% CI:
   1.04 to 4.25; p value: 0.036) and were more likely to participate in
   group sport (OR: 4.59; 95\% CI: 2.28 to 9.22; p value: 0.000). We found
   no significant relationship between physical activity and the weight
   status in the total sample, but among female participants, those with
   overweight status had higher odds of reporting high levels of physical
   exercise (OR: 4.50; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In terms of
   centrality, differentiating by gender, women who participated in group
   sports were more likely to be classified as having low values of
   centrality, while the opposite effect occurred for men, more likely to
   be classified as having high values of centrality. Conclusions Our
   findings, with limitations, underline the importance of two fundamental
   aspects to be taken into account in the design of future strategies:
   gender and the centrality within the social network depending on the

   creation process in nursing science and to investigate the dissemination
   of theoretical knowledge in other disciplines by analyzing citations and
   social network data.
   Method: This exploratory study evaluated Metadata to find academic
   publications. Meleis's Transition Theory was selected as a case study. A
   majority of the publications that represented the transition theory were
   assigned as the core of the theory. Forward and backward citations were
   used as agents of knowledge linkage to determine the dissemination of
   the theory in the field of science. Social network analysis and
   visualization were used to depict graphical and structural relations of
   the research front and the knowledge base.
   Results: The knowledge base of the Transition Theory was built on 7
   different information networks. The most effective and vast information
   network consisted of Meleis, AI as a researcher and the central
   information network, which is the journal of Nursing Research. Oncology,
   geriatrics, public health, and psychology in the areas of information
   propagation within the field of nursing were considered as research
   areas where the theoretical framework provided by the theory was
   rendered functional.
   Conclusion: In recent years, the use of theoretical frameworks has
   become a necessity to assess the changing needs of the study of nursing
   science. The method used in the study can be effectively used to analyze
   the conceptual structures in the nursing education and professional
   application processes and to understand the origins of these theories.
   Further research can help to structure the use of informational
   science-based research designs to understand the connections between

   world and ranks fifth in terms of causes of death in the United States.
   ``Time is brain{''} when it comes to the detection and treatment of a
   stroke as it can reduce morbidity and disability in the long run. May is
   recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned
   stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the
   risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the
   first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to
   formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke
   awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May
   from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke
   awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR
   \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network
   analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts.
   Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of
   relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact,
   reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags,
   influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage,
   Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke
   awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an
   overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the
   total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the
   tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard
   deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have
   been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top
   users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the
   event had primary involvement from the United States and the United
   Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents,
   especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates
   highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally.
   The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing
   countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement
   on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform
   future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and
   global health.},

   such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as
   other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin
   resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4)
   Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number of published
   articles of 59.8\%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the
   topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There
   has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries
   across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic
   analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics
   along with specialized health terms and terms related to public health.},

  month = {MAY 31},
  abstract = {Background: The global incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is
   continuously increasing, making it a potential worldwide public health
   concern. Research on dietary factors related to MetS has attracted
   considerable attention in the recent decades. However, the research
   hotspots, knowledge structure, and theme trends for the dietary factors
   associated with MetS remain unknown, and have not yet been
   systematically mapped. This study aimed to review the research status of
   diet as a risk factor for MetS through bibliometric methods.
   Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science database.
   Research hotspots were identified using biclustering analysis with the
   gCLUTO software, and knowledge structure was explored via social network
   analysis using the Ucinet software. Theme trends were investigated using
   evolutionary analysis with the SciMAT software. In total, 1,305 papers
   were analyzed. The research output on the dietary factors associated
   with MetS increased steadily. The research scope was gradually expanding
   and diverse. Overall, eight research hot spots, four key dietary nodes,
   and four motor themes on the dietary factors associated with MetS were
   identified. Fatty acids, dietary fiber, and polyphenols have been the
   focus of research in this field over the years. Evolutionary analysis
   showed that fish oil and vitamin C were well-developed research foci
   recently. Prebiotics was recognized as an emerging theme with certain
   developmental potential. These findings provide a better understanding
   of the research status of the dietary factors associated with MetS and a
   reference for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Haze pollution has become one of the most important environment problems
   in China, raising increasing serious public health concerns. When
   carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's
   anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of
   government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain
   period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious
   haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a
   social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme
   of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with
   enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement
   network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's
   structure, and the centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the
   goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a
   larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure
   of the enforcement network became flatter, with a horizontal' management
   arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to
   the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the
   campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward
   the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results
   reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more
   specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network
   structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to
   local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those
   departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides
   managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors
   involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy
   implementation.},

  abstract = {Background Social network analysis (SNA) is often used to examine how
   social relationships influence adolescent health behaviours, but no
   study has documented the range of network measures used to do so. We
   aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health
   behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network
   measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA.
   Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts
   commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the
   network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer
   behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms.
   Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all
   distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included
   articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The
   categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201,
   100\%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6\%) and popularity
   (n=110, 54.7\%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for
   `similarity on popularity' (within the `similarity' category) to 28 for
   the `characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and
   nominated peers' (within the `nature of the relationships' category).
   Using the examples of `social isolation', `group membership',
   `individuals in a central position' (within the `position within the
   network' category) and `nominations of influential peers' (sub within
   the `popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting
   and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust
   methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures
   in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public
   health intervention based on SNA.},

  abstract = {Benefits of physical activity (PA) in breast cancer survivors (BCS) are
   well established. However, programs to promote PA among BCS tailored to
   real-world contexts within low- to middle-income countries are limited.
   Cross-sector co-creation can be key to effective and scalable programs
   for BCS in these countries. This study aimed to evaluate the networking
   process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation of a PA
   program for Colombian BCS called My Body. We employed a mixed-methods
   design including semistructured interviews, workshops and a social
   network analysis of centrality measures to assess stakeholders'
   engagement, resources and skills enabling the collaborative work,
   challenges, outcomes and lessons learned. The descriptive analysis and
   the centrality measures of the network revealed that 19 cross-sector
   stakeholders engaged in the My Body collaborative network. Through
   ongoing communication and cooperation, My Body built relationships
   between the academic lead institutions (local and international), and
   local and national public, private and academic institutions working in
   public health, sports and recreation, social sciences and engineering
   fields. The outcomes included the co-creation of the community-based PA
   program for BCS, its implementation through cross-sector synergies,
   increased relationships and communications among stakeholders, and
   successful dissemination of evidence and project results to the
   collaboration partners and other relevant stakeholders and community
   members. The mixed-methods assessment enabled understanding of ways to
   advance cross-sector co-creation of health promotion programs. The
   findings can help to enable continued development of sustainable
   cross-sector co-creation processes aimed at advancing PA promotion.
   Lay Summary Collaborative work among stakeholders and researchers from
   different governmental sectors and disciplinary fields can be key to
   design and implement effective and scalable programs to promote physical
   activity (PA) among breast cancer survivors (BCS). This might be
   particularly critical in low- to middle-income countries where the
   implementation of evidence-based health-promoting programs tailored to
   real-world contexts are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the
   networking process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation
   of a PA program for Colombian BCS. We employed qualitative methods and
   social network analyses to assess stakeholders' engagement, resources
   and skills enabling the collaborative work, challenges, outcomes and
   lessons learned. The co-creation of the program improved synergies
   between research, policy and practice. Communication through several
   channels including e-mail and workshops was the key resource to advance
   the collaborative work. Stakeholders underscored that cross-sector
   networking allowed allocating resources and achieving shared goals.

   including an aging workforce, reductions in funding, and 2 simultaneous
   major threats to public health-the coronavirus pandemic and racial
   injustice. To effectively harness promising new technologies and address
   these and other public health challenges ahead, public health
   professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting
   and improving public health. This project sought to understand the
   network of health departments and organizations that provide training in
   order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve
   access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby
   strengthening the public health system. Design/Setting/Participants: We
   conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting
   Region V of the Department of Health \& Human Services. The survey
   focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national
   organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social
   network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics
   to examine the network. Results: Of 290 participating health departments
   (58\% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at
   least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248
   LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10
   national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected
   to the state health department for training than to any other
   organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national
   membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local
   health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with
   its number of training connections. Conclusions: State health
   departments may benefit from the support of universities, national
   nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer
   training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs.
   Additional qualitative information from local and state health
   departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for

  journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {18},
  month = {MAR},
  abstract = {Introduction
   Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for
   accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health
   departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could
   prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to
   determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an
   informal network to share information and advice about innovative
   community health practices, programs, and policies.
   Methods
   In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303
   senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of
   advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices
   informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based
   practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a
   social network analysis program to assess answers.
   Results
   A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate
   nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by
   peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24
   acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together
   (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we
   surveyed performed neither of these roles.
   Conclusion
   Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed
   to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and
   adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new
   public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results
   useful both for emergencies and for practice-as usual.},

  abstract = {Existing methods in social {[}oral] epidemiology primarily utilize
   statistical models that assume static characteristics of individuals and
   environments. While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the
   social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and
   progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture
   complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments
   respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a
   variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent
   consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social
   Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial
   health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple
   levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new
   and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite
   of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative
   mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral
   health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic
   interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study
   and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients,
   healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any
   differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future
   longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively.
   This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of
   complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex
   systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics
   models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges
   faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods
   into the population oral health sciences.},

   development of translational biomedical research centers is a form of
   public health intervention. Establishing rigorous methods for measuring
   center success and outcomes is essential to justify continued funding.
   Methods: Bibliometric data compiled from a 5-year funding cycle of
   neurodegeneration and translational neuroscience research center were
   analyzed using the package bibliometrix for open-source software R and
   the NIH-developed research tool iCite. Results: The research team and
   their collaborators (n = 485) produced 157 grant-citing publications
   from 2015-2020. The science was produced by small research teams
   clustered around three main communities of topics: Alzheimer's Disease,
   brain imaging, and neuropsychological testing in the elderly. Using the
   relative citation ratio, the publications produced by the research team
   were found to be influential when compared to other R01-funded
   publications. Conclusion: Recent developments in bibliometric analysis
   expand beyond traditional measurement capabilities to better understand
   the characteristics, outcomes, and influences of research teams. These
   findings can be used to inform researchers and institutions about
   research team composition, productivity, and success. Measures of
   research influence may be used to justify return on investment to

   China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study},
  journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {23},
  number = {3},

  abstract = {Background: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media
   is vital for rumor control and disease containment during public health
   crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a
   certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination
   networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction
   behaviors.
   Objective: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of
   rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect
   on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a
   Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19
   epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information
   characteristics of user interaction content.
   Methods: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl
   rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23,
   2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment
   analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first
   analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on
   the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on
   others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude
   distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions
   between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels,
   we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction
   content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking
   and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect.
   Results: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an
   essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism
   played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might
   not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and
   verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting
   interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment,
   information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online
   users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and
   information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment,
   which was often accompanied by incivility.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo
   chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction
   mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content.
   Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing
   or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.},

  abstract = {The analysis of domestic pig movements has become useful to understand
   the disease spread patterns and epidemiology, which facilitates the
   development of more effective animal diseases control strategies. The
   aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics
   of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the
   contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine
   fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the
   National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network
   analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered
   premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also
   created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises
   movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average
   diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path
   length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world
   structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55\%).
   Backyard producers made up 89\% of the network premises, and the top 2\%
   of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50\% of the movements. The
   highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of
   the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was
   in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF)
   disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of
   network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented
   the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and
   parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to
   improve its procedures and update the disease control and management
   policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based
   surveillance.},

   used alcohol and drugs with their network peers at a higher rate than

   attempted suicide recently were significantly more likely to have more

   Design Cross-sectional comparative and social network analysis.
   Setting England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.
   Participants 100 donors (pharmaceutical companies) reporting payments to
   4229 recipients (healthcare organisations and patient organisations) in
   2015.
   Main outcome measures For each country: payment totals and distribution;
   average number of common recipients between companies; share of payments
   to organisations fulfilling different roles in the health ecosystem and
   payments for different activities.
   Results Companies prioritised different types of recipient and different
   types of activity in each country. There were significant differences in
   the distribution of payments across the four countries, even for similar
   types of recipients. Recipients in England and Wales received smaller
   individual payments than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Overall,
   targeting shared recipients occurred most frequently in England, but was
   also common in certain pockets of each country's health ecosystem. We
   found evidence of reporting errors in Disclosure UK.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest a strategic approach to payments
   tailored to countries' policy and decision-making context, indicating
   there may be specific vulnerabilities to financial conflicts of interest
   at subnational level. Payment differences between countries may be
   occurring in other countries, particularly those with decentralised
   health systems and/or high levels of independence across its
   decision-making authorities. We call for a single database containing
   all recipient types, full location details and published with associated

  number = {1},
  pages = {3-9},
  month = {MAR},
  abstract = {Background: Despite health care advances, artificial intelligence and
   government interventions aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of
   citizens, huge disparities and failures in care provision exist. This is
   demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in
   readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health
   systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural
   disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the
   health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service,
   funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and
   carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple
   providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use
   of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as
   those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A
   description of the system thinking methodology and its associated
   methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft
   system methodology are described with examples in the health care
   setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that
   have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of
   implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the
   Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However,
   many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most
   effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and
   champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a
   modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an
   appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a
   result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems
   thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex
   health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex
   problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care.
   Conclusion: It is important that methods to implement systems thinking
   methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.},

  year = {2022},
  volume = {10},
  month = {NOV 18},
  abstract = {Group living is beneficial for individuals, but also comes with costs.
   One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission
   because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often
   associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social
   structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection
   and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the
   links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in
   primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only
   adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here,
   we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and
   an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole
   group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact
   of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test:
   (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of
   partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of
   social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection
   intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what
   extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might
   influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network
   analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over
   three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out
   simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group
   level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth
   infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult
   females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of
   this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical
   significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were
   removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group
   network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an
   effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that
   sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects
   involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting
   earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social
   networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations
   for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications
   for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health
   interventions.},

   addressed though complex interventions. Complex interventions are
   intentional processes designed to shift and realign the form and
   function of targeted system patterns by changing underlying system
   dynamics, structures, and conditions. The IM40 initiative was a complex
   health promotion intervention designed to address adolescent health and
   well-being through a developmental assets approach. The initiative
   sought to influence several levels simultaneously (e.g. individual,
   professional, procedural, and policy), compounding the complexity for
   implementation and evaluation. The purpose of this case study is to
   present the development and initiation of an evaluation approach based
   on systems thinking and complexity science principles, concepts, and
   methods. We used three systems methods, Group Model Building (GMB),
   viable systems model (VSM) assessment, and Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   to identify and examine underlying patterns and structures that
   influenced system-wide behaviors. Each method focused on a general
   systems-oriented question and illuminated stakeholder views of the IM40
   theory of change, adaptive organization of multiple independent
   institutions, and relational ties among system actors. Collectively, the
   methods enabled us to describe systems change over time and examine

  abstract = {Aim The main purpose of our study is to determine the current research
   status of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and birth defects by
   means of co-word analysis, to explore the hot spots and weak points of
   current research, and to provide ideas and opinions for follow-up
   researchers.
   Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge
   structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published
   literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH
   terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix
   Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to
   the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was
   performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence
   matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network
   analysis (SNA).
   Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of
   all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were
   identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the
   strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods
   and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In
   contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology
   is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research. For SNA
   results, the position status of each component is described by the
   center value.
   Conclusions By providing a quantitative bibliometric study, it can help
   with the overall command of the latest topic and guide researchers in
   their new projects.},

   in a large population of zoo birds},
  journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {193},
  month = {2021 AUG},
  abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted
   to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict
   future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between
   different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409
   individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely
   monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A
   retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were
   used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird,
   and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed
   from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure
   histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable
   longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether
   exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was
   associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step.
   Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing
   mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for
   birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to
   another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a
   positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was
   independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds
   ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in
   adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in
   distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of
   interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further
   characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian
   mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more
   likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries
   and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the
   contact (same species versus different species) were also significant
   predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model
   variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and
   discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious
   process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low
   transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time
   even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation
   efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at
   reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population
   sustainability.},

  abstract = {In 2022, a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created considerable
   challenges for the Shanghai public health system. However, conventional
   prevention and control strategies, which only rely on formal
   organizations, inefficiently decrease the number of infections. Thus, a
   multi-organization management mode is needed for pandemic prevention. In
   this paper, we applied a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to
   analyze how these social organizations cooperate with others and further
   identify the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and
   sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of
   social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of
   the actor's attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative
   behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220
   participants in 19 social organizations. The results indicated that the
   number of cooperative relationships increased during the pandemic, from
   44 to 162, which means the network between social organizations became
   more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models
   were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and e/s >
   2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a
   positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all
   except the ``same age group effect (-1.02){''}. The results also
   indicated that the social organizations tend to build relationships with
   more active actors in the community in every time period. This paper is
   of great significance regarding the innovation of public health system
   management and the improvement of Chinese grassroots governance.},

   substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help
   institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter
   related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19.
   Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of
   artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using
   tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in
   English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the
   study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
   sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network
   of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral,

   434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%)
   as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5
   dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment,
   emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological
   stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the
   states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North
   Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most
   positive sentiment.
   Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19

   information sharing across audiences. Design: This study analyzes data
   from a 2016 US survey of 491 metropolitan LHDs and 556 nonmetropolitan
   LHDs. Researchers first conducted social network analysis of network
   density, defined as the total number of potential organizations
   contributing to a jurisdiction's health communication activities.
   Researchers then conducted logistic regression to compare the
   relationship between network density and reported health communication
   activities targeting 3 specific audiences: policy makers, lay publics,
   and mass media. Results: Three network types emerged on the basis of the
   number of organizations that contribute to health communication
   activities, with low-density Minimal networks more common in
   nonmetropolitan jurisdictions and higher-density Expanded and Robust
   networks more common in metropolitan jurisdictions. LHDs in Minimal
   networks were significantly less likely to communicate with policy
   makers, lay publics, and mass media than their counterparts in
   higher-density networks (P < .05). Conclusions: LHDs are embedded in
   organizational communication networks that vary in both the number of
   communication partners and the types of audiences reached. Examining
   their own local organizational communication networks may provide
   insights into LHDs that wish to improve the effectiveness of public

   as practitioners, policy makers and scholars lament the lack of progress

   social determinants of health. Systems science may be well suited to
   tackle such wicked problems. While there is a growing application of
   systems thinking tools and resources in public health, there are fewer
   examples that incorporate both systems tools and systemic inquiry
   processes. Prevention Tracker offered an opportunity to trial the
   combination of systems tools and systems thinking at the level of
   community chronic disease prevention efforts. Our methodology comprised
   four Domains of Inquiry. 1. Describing a prevention system 2. Guiding
   system change efforts 3. Monitoring change 4. Cross case comparison. We
   applied systems tools and methods to investigate each domain of inquiry
   such as group model building, social network analysis, graphic
   illustration, causal loop diagrams and system action learning. These
   methods were connected through the application of systemic inquiry
   processes that elevated the ongoing interrogation of boundary judgments,
   awareness of diverse and multiple perspectives, interrelationships and
   the importance of social learning. Prevention Tracker demonstrated that
   it is possible to apply a range of systems methods while also keeping
   focus on the overall systems science and the need for theoretical
   consistency. The four domains of inquiry enabled flexibility to adapt
   our approach in each context to learn and improve. This methodological
   capacity to learn and adapt may also be useful in tackling other health
   and social problems, such as the COVID19 pandemic. The overall findings

  abstract = {Purpose Studies from the 1970s and 1980s, but also recent investigations
   on social media suggest that wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance can
   be a cause of bullying and social exclusion. With the greater uptake of
   orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed
   braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable.
   This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects
   adolescents' social position in their peer networks using
   cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the
   seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about
   their social relationships in school. These directed network data were
   used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and
   victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical
   analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression
   models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19\% of the
   surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls
   with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for
   friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for
   victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These
   associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic
   differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically
   insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces
   in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students
   with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position
   in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses
   exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in
   interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology,
   epidemiology and medicine.},

   Deep Learning and Topic Modeling Approach},
  journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {22},
  number = {12},
  month = {DEC 8},
  abstract = {Background: The massive scale of social media platforms requires an
   automatic solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic solutions
   will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous
   literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised
   text classification task using classical machine learning methods or,
   more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this
   problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published
   work on English text.
   Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the
   COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to
   discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech.
   Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic
   tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were
   analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network
   (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being
   the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to
   discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets.
   Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region
   identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the
   number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among
   COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also
   revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%)
   contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN.
   This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the
   most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore,
   we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the
   time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate tweets
   (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it
   was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was
   weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the
   Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also
   identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the
   pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7
   identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran.
   Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the
   Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health
   challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent
   use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate
   speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech
   may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the
   threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive
   language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context
   of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.},

  abstract = {PurposeFacing the global public health emergency (GPHE), the conflict of
   cultural differences and the imbalance of vital resources such as
   knowledge among different organizations are becoming more severe, which
   affects the enthusiasm and sustainability of firms' innovation heavily.
   It is an urgent problem to be solved for firms how to make use of
   internal knowledge and external power to help firms' sustainable
   innovation (FSI). Thus, the purpose of this study is to deeply analyze
   how firms' internal knowledge diversity (KD) and external ego-network
   structures {[}ego-network density (ED) and honest brokers (HB)] affect
   FSI, as well as how the ego-network structures (ED and HB) moderate the
   relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of the ego
   network. Design/methodology/approachBased on the data of the alliance
   innovation networks of China's new energy industries in 2009-2019, this
   study uses the social network analysis method and negative binomial
   regression model to explore the effect of KD and ego-network structures
   (ED and HB) on FSI, as well as the moderating effects of ego-network
   structures (ED and HB) on the relationship between KD and FSI based on
   the perspective of ego network. FindingsThis study finds that KD, ED and
   HB can boost FSI. Moreover, ED plays a negative moderating role in the
   relationship between KD and FSI. However, the negative moderating effect
   of HB on the relationship between KD and FSI is not significant.
   Research limitations/implicationsThis study presents fresh empirical
   evidence and new insights for firms on how to make full use of firms'
   internal KD and external ego-network structures to facilitate FSI.
   Originality/valueFirst, this study not only enriches the research on the
   consequences of KD but also expands our understanding of the
   knowledge-based view to some extent. Second, this study not only
   enriches the motivation research of the FSI based on the perspective of
   ego-network in the context of the GPHE but also expands the application
   scope of social network theory and sustainable innovation' theory in
   part. Third, this paper is a new attempt to apply social network theory
   and knowledge-based view at the same time.},

  abstract = {Background Interdisciplinary cooperation among university actors and
   resulting intersectoral synergies are considered cornerstones in the
   process of incorporating health promotion practices in everyday
   university life in order to break down barriers and provide better
   access to health promotion services. To date, no network of a
   health-promoting university has been examined regarding the processes
   underlying tie formation, network emergence, and maintenance.Objectives
   and methods The goals of this study are to obtain insight into the
   mechanisms of cooperation between university actors in a
   health-promoting network and to identify the structural and attributive
   factors associated with establishing cooperation between actors in the
   observed network in order to better understand how to build and develop
   successful networks in the future. For this purpose, a social network
   analysis was carried out and exponential random graph models were
   estimated to test corresponding hypotheses.Results The network at hand
   consists of 33 actors (e.g. University Sports Center, General Student
   Committee) and shows a flat, non-hierarchical structure. Data reveal
   that attributed competence predicts cooperation (0.32; p < 0.05).
   Significant homophily effects among student actors (1.31; p < 0.05) and
   among university actors (0.59; p < 0.05) were found. All structural
   predictors examined were significant (0.22-5.40; p < 0.05) and are
   therefore essential in determining the likelihood of cooperation between
   actors involved in the network.Conclusion The results of this study
   provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cooperation and
   can be used to further develop the network at hand (e.g. selection of
   key actors for information dissemination or integration of peripheral
   actors). In addition, the findings offer starting points for sustained
   network development at other universities (e.g. significance of network
   governance form or goal consensus). Knowing the factors that influence
   the network structure, here the conditions of cooperation, results in
   opportunities to encourage empowerment among actors. However, the
   analysis of the network undertaken does not directly bear on the success
   of the network.},

  month = {JUL 17},
  abstract = {Background
   As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors
   that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that
   acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors
   at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and
   lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis
   (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the
   organizations working on maternal \& child health (MCH) and water \&
   sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL
   Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural
   block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine
   public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder
   relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation
   involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a
   low-and middle-income countries.
   Method
   An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24
   organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh,
   India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured
   interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and
   homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative
   analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH.
   Results
   Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working
   on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of
   Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the
   organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to
   play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between
   other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points.
   Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in
   increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout
   the network.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA
   for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It
   also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the
   unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including
   challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the structure, content, quality, and quantity of
   partnerships that developed in response to a national cardiovascular
   health initiative, Million Hearts. Design: This study used a social
   network analysis (SNA) approach to assess the Million Hearts initiative
   network partnerships and identify potential implications for policy and
   practice. Setting/Participants: The Million Hearts network comprised a
   core group of federal and private sector partners that participate in
   Million Hearts activities and align with initiative priorities. To bound
   the network for the SNA, we used a list of 58 organizations (74\%
   response rate) from a previously completed qualitative analysis of
   Million Hearts partnerships. Main Outcome Measures: We used the online
   PARTNER (Program to Analyze Record and Track Networks to Enhance
   Relationships-) survey to collect data on individual organizational
   characteristics and relational questions that asked organizations to
   identify and describe their relationships with other partners in the
   network. Key SNA measures include network density, centralizations,
   value, and trust. Results: Our analyses show a network that is
   decentralized, has strong perceptions of trust and value among its
   members, and strong agreement on intended outcomes. Interestingly,
   partners report a desire and ability to contribute resources to Million
   Hearts; however, the perceptions between partners are that resources are
   not being contributed at the level they potentially could be. The
   majority of partners reported that being in the network helped them
   achieve their goals related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The
   largest barrier to successful activities within the network was cited as
   lack of targeted funding and staff to support participation in the
   network. Conclusions: The Million Hearts network described in this
   article is unique in its membership at the national level, agreement on
   outcomes, its powerful information-sharing abilities that require few
   resources, and its decentralized structure. We identified strategies
   that could be implemented to strengthen the network and its activities.
   By examining a national-level public-private partnership formed to
   address a public health issue, we can identify ways to strengthen the
   network and provide a framework for developing other initiatives.},

   analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with
   informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics
   were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with
   95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It
   was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas,
   except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was
   found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater
   fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of

  abstract = {Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and cultural
   sector, challenged by classical swine fever (CSF). Recently, the
   National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control
   the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination
   against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig
   premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement
   restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the
   network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected,
   recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were
   used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from
   2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard
   farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most
   influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and
   4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3
   shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy
   resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement
   restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement
   restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and
   markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the
   best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available,
   highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the
   network. When comparing the static network with its temporal
   counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in
   the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required
   4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS
   surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most
   at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal
   information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This
   information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance
   reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.},

   that serve pregnant and parenting women with substance use disorder
   (SUD) in an urban and a rural community.Data Sources and Study Settings:
   Two community networks, one urban and one rural with each including a
   residential substance use treatment program, in Kentucky during
   2021.Study Design: Social network analysis measured system collaboration
   and cross-sector alignment between healthcare, public health, and social
   services organizations, applying the Framework for Aligning Sectors. To
   understand the alignment and structure of each network, we measured
   network density overall and between sectors, network centralization, and
   each organization's degree centrality and effective size.Data
   Collection/Extraction Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews
   were conducted to document alignment around shared purpose, data,
   financing, and governance.Principal Findings: On average, overall and
   cross-sector network densities in both communities were similar.
   However, alignment was highest for data sharing and financing in the
   urban community and for shared purpose and governance in the rural
   community. Cross-sector partnerships involving healthcare organizations
   were more prevalent in the rural county (44\% vs. 38\% for
   healthcare/public health, 44\% vs. 29\% for healthcare/social services),
   but more prevalent for those involving public health/social services
   organizations in the urban county (42\% vs. 24\%). A single healthcare
   organization had the highest degree centrality (Mdn {[}IQR] = 26
   {[}26-9.5]) and effective size (Mdn {[}IQR] = 15.9 {[}20.6-8.7]) within
   the rural county. Social services organizations held more central
   positions in the urban county (degree centrality Mdn {[}IQR] = 13
   {[}14.8-9.5]; effective size Mdn {[}IQR] = 10.4
   {[}11.4-7.9]).Conclusions: Cross-sector alignment may strengthen local
   capacity for comprehensive SUD care for pregnant and parenting women.
   Healthcare organizations are key players in cross-sector partnerships in
   the rural community, where one healthcare facility holds the central
   brokerage role. In contrast, public health agencies are key to
   cross-sector collaboration with social services in the urban community.},

  abstract = {Background: Obesity and overweight are a serious health problem
   worldwide with multiple and connected causes. Simultaneously, chatbots
   are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in
   mobile health apps.
   Objective: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility
   study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of
   individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations.
   Methods: We first studied the users' needs and gathered users' graphical
   preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150
   design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics,
   diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and
   desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then
   designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to
   test feasibility.
   Results: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4
   specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot
   named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical
   activity, social network, user's status score, and project information.
   We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores
   about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and
   social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot
   implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who
   completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11\%), 5
   overweight people (7\%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4
   kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk
   and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10
   minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting
   30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network
   with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities.
   Conclusions: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect
   data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical
   activity, BMI, and specific diseases. Besides, the chatbot allows the
   connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity
   causes from both individual and social perspectives.},

  abstract = {When a coastal town transforms from a rural area to an emerging city, it
   faces many safety risks. Some are new risks from urban construction,
   while some are traditional risks that belong to this coastal area. The
   joint efforts of these risks may lead to new hazards, harming public
   health, but this problem has not been noticed in previous studies.
   Therefore, this study constructs the Triangular Framework for Safety
   Risk in New Towns to identify the risks and proposes strategies to
   reduce the risks. In this study, multiple methods are integrated,
   including Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL),
   Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Social Network Analysis
   (SNA). This study takes the Lin-gang Special Area in China as a case
   study to verify the framework's effectiveness. Sixteen disaster-causing
   factors are identified, and the internal linkages among these factors
   are clarified. Results show that the hybrid method performs well in
   quantitatively analyzing the risk factors of new coastal towns. A
   typhoon, public risk perception, and population migration are essential
   influencing factors. Disaster prevention capability of high-rise
   buildings, disaster prevention capacity of port facilities, and
   transportation are the most direct influencing factors. Environmental
   degradation is the most conductive among all elements. This study
   contributes to the theoretical theory by proposing an effective
   framework to analyze the safety risks in new coastal towns. In addition,
   it provides practical references for governments to make emergency plans
   in the city.},

  abstract = {Introduction There is growing concern about transnational tobacco
   corporations' (TTCs) and other commercial actors' involvement in
   e-cigarette policy development. Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used
   e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and
   re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other
   types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. Methods This
   paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement
   in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views
   on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy
   consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a
   social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors.
   Results The results show that commercial actors' positions on
   e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs,
   independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial
   actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation
   (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial
   actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent
   regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to
   gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about
   TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being
   largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating
   arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial
   actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm
   reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Conclusion Awareness of the various
   commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in
   e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy
   development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of

   uses the joint invention patent of Shenzhen, a low-carbon pilot city of

   the interactions with these partners) is also expanding. The empirical
   results from the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) demonstrate that,

   caused by knowledge exchange makes organizations in the network more
   inclined to cognitive proximity and less dependent on geographical
   proximity. In addition, organizational proximity and triadic closure
   contribute positively to the collaborative network, with their relevance
   remaining nearly the same, while the impeding effect of

  journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {8},
  month = {JUN 26},
  abstract = {Background:Increased delivery of evidence-based preventive services can
   improve population health and increase health equity. Community-clinical
   partnerships offer particular promise, but delivery and sustainment of
   preventive services through these systems face several challenges
   related to service integration and collaboration. We used a social
   network analysis perspective to explore (a) the range of contributions
   made by community-clinical partnership network members to support the
   delivery of evidence-based preventive services and (b) important
   influences on the ability of these partnerships to sustain service
   delivery. Methods:Data come from an implementation evaluation of the
   Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund initiative, which supported nine
   Massachusetts communities to coordinate delivery of evidence-based
   prevention and address inequities in hypertension, pediatric asthma,
   falls among older adults, or tobacco use. In 2016, we conducted
   semi-structured interviews with (a) leadership teams representing nine
   community-level partnerships and (b) practitioners from four
   high-implementation partnerships (n= 23). We managed data using NVivo11
   and utilized a framework analysis approach. Results:Key network
   contributions for delivery of evidence-based preventive services
   included creating referrals, delivering services, providing links to
   community members, and administration and leadership. Less emphasized
   contributions included wraparound services, technical assistance, and
   venue provision. Implementers from high-implementation partnerships also
   highlighted contributions such as program adaptation, creating buy-in,
   and sharing information to improve service delivery. Expected drivers of
   program sustainability included the ability to develop a business case,
   ongoing network facilitation, technology support, continued integrated
   action, and sufficient staffing to maintain programming. Conclusion:The
   study highlights the need to take a long-term, infrastructure-focused
   approach when designing community-clinical partnerships. Strategic
   partnership composition, including identifying sources of necessary
   network contributions, in conjunction with efforts from the outset to
   link systems, align effort, and build a long-term funding structure can
   support the required coordinated action around preventive services

   results show that infection was positively associated with procuring
   fish from ponds, but negatively associated with procuring fish from
   rivers. Incorporating fish procurement sites substantially increases
   network connectivity, reinforcing the human connection to key fish
   sources as a potential risk factor for infection. The consideration of

  month = {JAN 12},
  abstract = {Background: Community engagement (CE) has been regarded as a critical
   element of successful health programs to achieve ``the health for
   all{''} goals. Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant
   role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing
   benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite
   this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health
   (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across
   disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify
   current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and
   future developments in this field.
   Methods: The bibliometric techniques were applied in the analysis of
   publications on CEPH in Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson
   Reuters. One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million
   publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references
   were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of
   publications, including distributions of geography, journals and
   categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were
   obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis,
   co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection,
   were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and
   evolution of CEPH.
   Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a
   sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or
   regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are
   geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the
   key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half
   of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South
   Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements
   of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and
   evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic
   actions. Based on keyword clustering and co-citation clustering, we
   propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome)
   framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current
   global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the
   future.
   Conclusion: This study draws an outline of the global review on the
   contemporary and cross-disciplinary research of CEPH which might present
   an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as
   well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are
   fundamental to inform policy making.},

  abstract = {Compound disasters are highly complex and can involve different types of
   disasters. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compound
   disasters of public health emergencies, accident disasters, and natural
   hazards have occurred frequently all over the world; therefore, it is
   important to establish effective compound disaster emergency
   collaboration networks. Thus, this study examined the 7 March building
   collapse in Quanzhou City as a case study. This case was a typical
   compound disaster involving a public health emergency and an accident
   disaster during COVID-19. Based on the network analysis, the overall
   response and dynamic characteristics of the emergency collaboration for
   compound disasters were examined in this study. A compound disaster
   emergency collaboration network (ECN) was constructed by identifying the
   interactional relationships between emergency organizations. After
   applying time slices, the dynamic evolution of network structure,
   organizational-functional relations, organizational attributes, and
   cross-organizational relationships were discussed. The research results
   showed the following: (1) The density and connectivity of the compound
   disaster ECN first decreased before increasing. Meanwhile, the evolution
   of the network structure followed a path from decentralized to
   concentrated and from being uneven to an equilibrium. (2) The
   characteristics and practices of compound disasters during different
   periods indicated varied emergency needs for emergency organizations. We
   found that the formation of emergency tasks not only involved the
   passive adaptation to match the practice for compound disasters, but
   also the active choices of emergency organizations when facing compound
   disasters according to their collective experiences and decisions. (3)
   The national emergency management departments, the government emergency

   This study explored compound disaster emergencies from the perspective
   of network analysis to improve our understanding of the current and
   developing organizational relationships and practices during a compound

  abstract = {Most Chinese provinces have a daily-updated database of live animal
   movements; however, the data are not efficiently utilized to support
   interventions to control H7N9 and other avian influenzas. Based on
   official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of
   live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and
   monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial
   movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in
   2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi.
   Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of
   inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces.
   Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler
   movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the
   province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar
   New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this
   study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live
   bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017
   were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting
   that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and
   reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same
   small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more
   than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same
   throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and
   improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be
   more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented
   indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that
   targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the
   movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease
   transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence
   to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and
   all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.},

  abstract = {Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
   neurodevelopmental disorder in children or early adolescents with an
   estimated worldwide prevalence of 7.2\%. Numerous articles related to
   ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had
   ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number
   of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis
   (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100
   most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject
   headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations.
   Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100
   most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded.
   Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of
   article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social
   network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for
   providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the
   MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation
   coefficients (CC).
   Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were
   research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most
   productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the
   United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most
   articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child
   and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms
   were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations
   (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were
   excluded because they do not have MeSH terms).
   Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to
   display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in
   predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top
   100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and
   other academic disciplines.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased worldwide.
   Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is
   associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality
   of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of
   comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and
   better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used
   in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health
   conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the
   progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This
   study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the
   Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity
   progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in
   Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and
   represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph
   theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e.,
   patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were
   selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian
   health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed
   from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two
   baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a
   normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte
   disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients
   with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that
   these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD
   in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially
   help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the
   progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the
   framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and
   private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health
   management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple
   chronic diseases.},

   when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical
   names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may
   vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address
   these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was
   to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness
   centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited
   authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes.
   Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between
   2000 and 2020 using the keyword ``Medicine {[}Journal].{''} Author
   names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were
   collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index
   was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names
   affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC
   method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major
   clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index
   within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH
   terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their
   research themes.
   Results: Our findings revealed the following: within the top 10 cited
   authors, 2 authors from China shared identical names with Jing Li and
   Tao-Wang; JA Winkelstein from Maryland (US) had the highest x-index
   (15.58); Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan was the most prolific author, having
   published 115 articles in Medicine since 2003; and the 3 primary
   research themes, namely, complications, etiology, and epidemiology, were
   identified using MeSH terms from the 10 most frequently cited authors.
   Conclusions: Using AWS and BC, we identified the top 10 most cited

  abstract = {Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs-often called
   misinformation or disinformation-through a population has never seemed
   so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from
   epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to
   how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from
   those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's
   set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly
   documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming
   messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or
   rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze
   agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but
   they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in
   empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade
   model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an
   internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion
   diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media
   institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the
   model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive
   effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds
   expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of
   the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across
   various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue
   from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model
   qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public
   opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to
   address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a
   framework with which social science misinformation researchers and
   computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand,
   and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation
   and ``alternative facts.{''}},

   a Border Region of the United States Based on Cultural Differences in
   Social Relationships: Protocol for a Survey Study},

  abstract = {Background: Health care-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are
   declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated
   infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health
   mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term
   goal is to use risk-based information from empirical
   socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to
   inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the
   community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural
   affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage
   and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors.
   Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates
   and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with
   disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups
   and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2)
   evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of
   health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission
   of S aureus.
   Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health
   sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer
   transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community
   and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if
   strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of
   community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from
   participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission
   within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social
   determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history,
   etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to
   determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S
   aureus transmission.
   Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of
   survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on
   the original funded design for this project (\#NIH U54MD012388). That
   design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337
   individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data
   assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined
   data monitoring procedures.
   Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific
   prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will
   also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are
   concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis
   of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission
   pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our
   understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across
   clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged
   nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for
   completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of
   S aureus carriage and transmission.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIncreasingly, public health faces challenges requiring
   complex, multifaceted and multi-sectoral responses. This calls for
   systems-based approaches that facilitate the kind of collective and
   collaborative thinking and working required to address complexity. While
   the literature on systems thinking, system dynamics and the associated
   methodologies is extensive, there remains little clear guidance on how
   to plan, govern and implement participatory systems approaches within a
   co-creation process.MethodsWe used a three-step process to develop
   DISCOVER, a framework for implementing, and governing systems-based
   co-creation:Stage 1: We conducted a literature analysis of key texts to
   identify well-documented methods and phases for co-creation using a
   systems approach, as well as areas where gaps existed.Stage 2: We looked
   for the most appropriate methods and approaches to fill the gaps in the
   knowledge production chain.Stage 3: We developed the framework,
   identifying how the different tools and approaches fit together
   end-to-end, from sampling and recruiting participants all the way
   through to responding with an action plan.ResultsWe devised DISCOVER to
   help guide researchers and stakeholders to collectively respond to
   complex social, health and wider problems. DISCOVER is a strategic
   research planning and governance framework that provides an actionable,
   systematic way to conceptualise complex problems and move from evidence
   to action, using systems approaches and co-creation. In this article, we
   introduce the eight-step framework and provide an illustrative case
   study showcasing its potential. The framework integrates complementary
   approaches and methods from social network analysis, systems thinking
   and co-creation literature. The eight steps are followed sequentially
   but can overlap.ConclusionsDISCOVER increases rigour and transparency in
   system approaches to tackling complex issues going from planning to
   action. It is being piloted in environmental health research but may be
   suitable to address other complex challenges and could be incorporated
   into research proposals and protocols for future projects.},

  abstract = {Many research fields, reaching from social networks and epidemiology to

   of the directed configuration model. In this way, we obtain new
   analytical expressions describing the polymeric microstructure and
   compare them to data from experiments and computer simulations. The
   molecular weight distribution is related to the sizes of connected
   components, gelation to the emergence of the giant component, and the
   molecular gyration radii to the Wiener index of these components. A
   model on this level of generality is instrumental in accelerating the
   design of new materials and optimizing their properties, as well as it

  abstract = {Contagion processes have been widely studied in epidemiology and life
   science in general, but their implications are largely tangible in other
   research areas, such as in network science and computational social
   science. Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the
   study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its
   applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing
   campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic
   networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place
   when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some
   of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish
   papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in
   their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider
   that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon
   involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in
   scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered
   those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is
   generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in
   bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge,
   information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different
   meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper,
   we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of
   inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show
   its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors,
   papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large
   bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used
   as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic
   ranking applications.},

   are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed
   before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and
   less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students

   Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) adopted by the World
   Health Organization in 2003 and ratified by approximately 94\% of
   countries as of 2016. We constructed five networks: (1) geographic
   distance, (2) general trade, (3) tobacco trade, (4) GLOBALink referrals,
   and (5) GLOBALink co-subscriptions. Network exposure terms were
   constructed from these networks based on the implementation scores for
   six articles of the FCTC treaty. We estimate effects using a lagged Type
   1 Tobit model. Results show that network effects were significant: (a)
   across all networks for article 6 (pricing and taxation), (b) distance,
   general trade, GL referrals, and GL co-subscriptions for article 8
   (second hand smoke), (c) distance, general trade, and GL
   co-subscriptions for article 11 (packaging and labeling), and (d)
   distance and GL co-subscription for article 13 (promotion and
   advertising), (e) tobacco trade and GL co-subscriptions for article 14

   prevalent for pricing and taxation as well as restrictions on smoking in
   public places and packaging and labeling. These results suggest that
   network influences are possible in domains that are amenable to control
   by national governments but unlikely to occur in domains established by

  abstract = {The prevalence of the anti-vaccine movement in today's society has
   become a pressing concern, largely amplified by the dissemination of
   vaccine skepticism. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   the vaccination debate sparked controversial debates on social media
   platforms such as Twitter, which can lead to serious consequences for
   public health. What determines anti-vax attitudes is an important
   question for understanding the source of the campaigns and mitigating
   the misinformation spread. Compared with other countries, Turkiye
   differentiates itself with high vaccination rates and lack of political
   support for anti-vaxxers despite its highly polarized political system.
   Analyzing Turkish Twittersphere, we explore several mechanisms capturing
   content production and behaviors of accounts within the pro- and
   anti-vax segments in online vaccine-related discussions. Our findings
   indicate there is no relation between political stance and anti-vaccine
   attitude. Both supporters of vaccination (pro-vaxxers) and opponents
   (anti-vaxxers) can be found across the political spectrum. Moreover,
   linguistic differences reveal that anti-vaxxers employ more emotional
   language, while pro-vaxxers express more skepticism. Notably, automated
   accounts are less prevalent leading to difficulty in assessing genuine
   support for vaccines, while anti-vaccine bots produce slightly more
   content. These findings have crucial implications for vaccine policy,
   emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse language patterns
   and beliefs among anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers to develop effective

  abstract = {Background: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among Inuit
   in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to better understand
   the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using
   whole-genome sequencing.
   Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in
   Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within
   clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with
   detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm.
   Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the
   WGS data analysis.
   Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified,
   all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all
   cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster,
   2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading
   events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was
   linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further
   transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An
   algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events
   demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95\% confidence
   interval, .97-1.0).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely
   residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house,
   combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant
   factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic
   community.},

  journal = {FOOD SECURITY},
  year = {2023},

  abstract = {The rising prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity within the
   Caribbean is a major public health and policy concern because obese
   children are at risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
   later in life. Throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), children
   are consuming unhealthy diets, characterized by energy-dense, processed
   and ultra-processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages, and limited
   quantities of fruits and vegetables. Community-based school meal
   programmes (SMPs) have been identified as useful vehicles to address
   unhealthy eating among children, and ``farm-to-school{''} approaches
   have the potential to increase the availability of locally grown
   nutritious produce, while supporting local agriculture and reducing the

   the barriers to enhancing community-based school feeding value-chains in
   the CARICOM, by focusing on the Eastern Caribbean Island of Nevis where
   there is an interest in developing farm-to-school value chains. Using
   key informant interviews combined with focus groups with actors along
   the local food value chain, we identify the following barriers to an
   effective community-based SMP: a lack of communication and an absence of
   contractual agreements between local farmers and the SMP administration;
   generally low levels of child acceptance of school meals containing
   fresh vegetables; and limited intersectoral coordination and
   collaboration among SMP stakeholders and local farmers. Using social
   network analysis, we further discuss limitations in group organization
   and coordination among local farmers and opportunities for SMP
   improvement. The results point to the need for more integrative public
   policy development and greater community engagement to coordinate and
   strengthen the farm-to school approach to school feeding.},

  abstract = {Background: The importance of intersectoral cooperation networks among
   community organizations located in people's immediate environments in
   addressing population health problems such as physical inactivity has
   come into focus in recent years. To date, there is limited evidence on
   how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were
   (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the
   conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of
   sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on
   cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and
   physical activity providers as well as sports administrating
   organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in
   southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations;
   Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive
   procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network
   modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar
   structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks
   (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations
   had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random
   graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in
   triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central
   actors (preferential attachment effect). Organizations from different
   sectors cooperated more often than organizations from the same sector
   (heterophily effect). Conclusion: The study provided valid and robust
   findings on significant mechanisms and conditions of interorganizational
   cooperation in community networks focused on sport and physical activity
   promotion. Based on the results, implications for the development and

   Research Centers (PRCs) collaborate on public health activities with
   community agencies and organizations. We evaluated these collaborations
   by studying the relationships between co-authors from the PRCs and
   community agencies that published at least 1 article together in the
   first year of the program. Methods: We identified all the authors of
   articles published by PRCs and collaborating members in peer-reviewed
   journals between September 2014 and September 2015 and constructed a
   network showing the links between and among all the authors. We
   characterized the network with 4 measures of social structure (network
   components, network density, average clustering coefficient, average
   distance) and 3 measures of individual author performances (degree-,
   betweenness-, and closeness-centrality). Results: The 413 articles had
   1804 individual authors and 7995 co-authorship relationships (links) in
   212 peer-reviewed journals. These authors and co-authors formed 44
   separate, nonoverlapping groups (components). The largest ``giant{''}
   component containing most of the links involved 66.3\% (n = 1196) of the
   authors and 73.7\% (n = 5889) of the links. We identified 136
   ``information brokers{''} (authors with high closeness centrality: those
   who have the shortest links to the most authors). Two authors with high
   betweenness centrality (who had the highest number of co-authors; 104
   and 107) had the greatest ability to mediate co-authorships. Network
   density was low; only 0.5\% of all potential co-authorships were
   realized (7995 actual co-authorship/1 628 110 potential co-authorships).
   Conclusion: Information brokers and co-authorship mediators should be
   encouraged to communicate more with each other to increase the number of
   collaborations between network members and, hence, the number of
   co-authorships.},

   public health threat and spread rapidly between healthcare facilities
   (HCFs) during interfacility patient movement. We examined patterns of
   transmission of CRE associated with network clustering and positions
   during patient interfacility transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort
   study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social
   network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility
   patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method
   (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns
   of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and
   local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each
   healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis
   was applied to test the association between network measures and
   facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268
   healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals
   (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of
   New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters,
   yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad.
   The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate
   ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that
   of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with
   another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence
   rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a
   given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased
   surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are
   warranted.},

   research questions were addressed in the present study: (1) descriptive
   characteristics of the literature on UIL, (2) trends of annual
   scientific publications on UIL, (3) the most relevant and high-impact
   sources on UIL, (4) the most globally cited articles on UIL, (5) the
   most relevant countries on UIL, (6) outcomes of Bradford's Law of
   Scattering and Lotka's Law of scientific productivity and (7) the
   trending research areas and avenues for future studies on UIL.
   Design/methodology/approach - Systematic literature review and
   bibliometric analysis mapping techniques were applied to the present
   study to analyze 907 articles extracted from the Scopus database.
   Analysis tools used were Biblioshiny software and VOSviewer software.
   Findings - Findings show that the UIL is a progressively growing
   discipline with a record of a 5.71\% average annual growth rate in
   scientific production each year from 1970 to 2023. The United States,
   China and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries in the
   field of UIL in terms of total scientific production and citations.
   Academic entrepreneurship, industrial ecology, social network analysis,
   active learning, engineering education, health economics, public health,
   university-industry relationships, communication, causal layered
   analysis and competitiveness are the potential avenues for future
   researchers in the field of UIL based on the thematic map of keywords

   introduce geospatial thinking to research related to infectious

   population movements and urban linkages in the longer term following a
   pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study took 366 cities in China as the
   research subjects while exploring the relationship between urban contact
   and the outbreak of the pandemic from both national and regional
   perspectives using social network analysis (SNA), Pearson correlation
   analysis and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)
   modeling. The results revealed that the number of COVID-19 infections in
   China fluctuated with strain variation over the study period; the urban
   contact network exhibited a significant trend of recovery. The pandemic
   had a hindering effect on national urban contact, and this effect
   weakened progressively. Meanwhile, the effect exhibited significant
   spatial heterogeneity, with a weakening effect in the eastern region \&
   AP; northeast region > central region > western region, indicating a
   decreasing phenomenon from coastal to inland areas. Moreover, the four
   major economic regions in China featured border barrier effects, whereby
   urban contact networks constituted by cross-regional flows were more
   sensitive to the development of the pandemic. The geostatistical
   approach adopted in this study related to infectious disease and urban
   linkages can be used in other regions, and its findings provide a

  abstract = {Background: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) comprise over 90\% of the world's
   congenital anomalies and cause significant disability worldwide, while
   disproportionally burdening low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Research can help inform strategies that reduce disparities in accessing
   CLP care. We performed a scientometric analysis of CLP research in LMICs
   to identify influential contributors and themes.
   Methods: The authors searched seven citation databases accessed via Web
   of Science, from inception to March 2, 2021. Social network analysis was
   done using VOSviewer. The Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were
   used.
   Results: In total, 1561 articles authored by 6414 researchers affiliated
   with 2113 organizations in 119 countries were included. Most authors (n
   = 6387, 99.6\%) had published two or more articles. The USA (454
   articles), Brazil (211 articles), China (175 articles), and India (127
   articles) published the most. The most prolific institutions were the
   University of Sao Paulo (94 articles), the University of Pittsburgh (57
   articles), and the University of Iowa (55 articles). Marazita ML (33
   articles), Shi B (27 articles), and Murray JC (22 articles) had the
   highest number of publications. An estimated 510 articles (32.7\%) were
   focused on epidemiology, 240 (15.4\%) on management, and 54 (3.5\%) on
   global plastic surgery for CLP.
   Conclusions: LMICs are disproportionally burdened by CLP, but research
   is limited and often produced by high-income countries. This study
   elucidates partnership and health system strengthening opportunities to
   improve LMIC research capacity and ultimately informs the management and
   outcomes for patients with CLP.},

   agglomeration capacities and their influencing factors through social

   agglomeration capacity had a gradual strengthening trend, with capacity
   weakening from east to west (strongest in the eastern region, second
   strongest in the central region, and weakest in the western region).
   (ii) The spatial network of such capacities became more densely

   upward (downward) trend. (iii) In terms of centrality, the high-ranking
   provinces (or municipalities) were Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
   Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Tianjin,
   while the low-ranking were Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner

  abstract = {This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect
   contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs
   through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China.
   All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from
   the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed.
   Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the
   network between source counties was the primary objective of this study.
   A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network
   were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated
   for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of
   different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an
   epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from
   151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in
   January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from
   one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001)
   than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from
   counties inside Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan,
   Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties
   (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the two-month
   study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km
   from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January
   and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in
   January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a
   shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The
   most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and
   western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing
   counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness,
   degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of
   a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform
   targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig

   cardiovascular disease (CVD) driven by concentrated neighborhood social
   risk factors. We provide a case study of systems science application to
   address geographic CVD health disparities at the community level -
   informing the science of CVD health disparities research. MethodsWe
   conducted a two-phased, multi-methods needs assessment in the Denver,
   Colorado area. Phase I consisted of a social network analysis to map a
   two-mode network of existing CVD prevention interventions and their
   implementing organizations. In Phase II, group model building (GMB)
   sessions with key community, public health, and healthcare provider
   stakeholders, were utilized to identify and visualize community factors
   contributing to disparities in CVD risk, producing a consensus-based
   causal loop diagram. ResultsBetween May 2021 and June 2022, we conducted
   24 virtual, semi-structured interviews in Phase I to describe CVD
   prevention interventions, and 7 virtual GMB sessions in Phase II to
   describe experiences of disparities in CVD risk. For the purposes of
   this paper, we focus on a subset of results for both phases. In Phase I
   we identified 89 active CVD prevention interventions, 29 of which
   addressed tobacco use. In Phase II, causal loop diagrams revealed root
   causes of disparities in CVD risk. We provide an example of a causal
   loop diagram that focuses on the community prevalence of tobacco use,
   identifying stress as a key underlying factor driving disparities. The
   integration of findings from both phases highlighted the alignment and
   misalignment between quit tobacco intervention goals and how they are
   being experienced in marginalized communities. ConclusionSystems science
   methods were useful to organize a large number of CVD prevention
   efforts, and evaluate the root causes of CVD health disparities in a
   high risk community. By integrating these two aspects, interventions may
   be reoriented to more effectively address the root causes of CVD health
   disparities.},

   fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of
   mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban
   planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature
   addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal
   trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering
   the statistical ``laws{''} that govern human movements. A significant
   effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic
   trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human
   mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial
   problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the
   re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on
   state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical
   software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the
   aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we
   propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of
   providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze
   mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is
   efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library
   for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many
   functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic
   data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk
   related to the analysis of mobility datasets.},

  abstract = {Network science has increasingly become central to the field of
   epidemiology and our ability to respond to infectious disease threats.
   However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large,
   but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human
   mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to
   many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires
   substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically
   infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating
   epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a representative
   subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance.
   We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive
   thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S.
   Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most
   accurate approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which
   prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between
   their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of
   the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the
   epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the
   probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival
   times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10\%
   of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical
   utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted,
   undirected network are most important to disease spread.
   Author summary
   Epidemiologists increasingly use social networks to understand how
   geography, demographics, and human mobility affect disease spread and
   the effectiveness of intervention strategies. While highly detailed data
   on human social networks are now available, the size and density of
   these modern networks makes them computationally intensive to study. To
   address this challenge, we study methods for reducing a network to its
   most important links. Following recent work in computer science, we use
   the effective resistance, which takes both local and global connectivity
   into account. We test this method in simulations on a U.S.-wide mobility
   network and find that it preserves epidemic dynamics with high fidelity.
   Combined with efficient epidemic simulation algorithms, our approach can
   facilitate a more effective response to epidemics.},

  abstract = {Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises
   that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological
   purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production
   chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases
   through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social
   network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns
   and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the
   movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures
   in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as
   bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and
   slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over
   the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil
   with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the
   static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade,
   (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises
   from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the
   potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the
   cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease
   transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease
   spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the
   study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly
   connected (similar to 94\%) trade network, with strong temporal trends,
   especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly
   clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential
   for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB
   transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top
   7\% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the
   total number of infected farms over three years by >50\%. In conclusion,
   the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly
   connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being
   close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having
   animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and
   betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between
   premises in RS.},

  abstract = {Background: The association between social isolation and cognitive
   perfor-mance has been less investigated in low-to-middle-income
   countries (LMIC) and the presence of depression as a moderator on this
   association has not been examined. The authors examined the associations
   of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance
   in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this
   cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite
   score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The
   dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered
   memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and
   logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical
   variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms
   with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression,
   measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale,
   modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age
   = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were
   associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI:
   0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B
   = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms
   with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with
   loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker
   association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among
   those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an
   LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse
   cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the
   strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are
   important to assess the direction of the association between social
   isolation and cognitive performance. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2023;

  abstract = {Objective Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur commonly
   in children and have been related to bullying victimization. However,
   whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are
   related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We
   used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying
   perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were
   associated with future hallucinatory experiences.
   Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based
   Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer
   acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N =
   925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions
   within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization
   was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences
   were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for
   sociodemographic covariates.
   Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively
   associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR =
   1.22, 95\% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and
   bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory
   experiences three years later than children who were not involved in
   bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim =
   1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer

   with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection =
   1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024).
   Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially
   rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory
   experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a
   victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable
   for psychotic experiences.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe recent Zika virus (ZIKAV) epidemics disclosed a major
   public health threat and a scientific and technological (S\&T)
   challenge. The lessons learned from the S\&T response of Latin America
   and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further
   research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to
   assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can
   contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and
   social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific
   contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to
   December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of
   Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles
   were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and
   LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the
   Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit
   Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were
   individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe
   retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase
   from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications
   and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global
   network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by
   experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC
   assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC
   research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection,
   along with vector control, which was also the main focusof
   patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of
   ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a
   key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV;
   (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV
   clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was
   potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the
   ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing
   patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech
   patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary
   approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and
   control future outbreaks.},

   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada, which
   supported clinicians to prescribe opioids, stimulants, and
   benzodiazepines. We aimed to determine the extent to which uptake and
   discontinuation of an initial attempt at a prescribed safer supply (PSS)
   program were influenced through networks of prescribers.MethodsWe
   executed a retrospective population-based study using linked health
   administrative data that captured all clinicians who prescribed to at
   least one client with a substance use disorder from March 27, 2020, to
   August 31, 2021. Our main exposure was the prescribing patterns of an
   individuals' peers, defined as the proportion of a prescribers'
   professional network (based on shared clients), which had previously
   prescribed PSS, updated monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a
   clinician had prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given
   calendar month. The secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS
   prescribing, defined as an absence for PSS prescriptions for at least 3
   months. We estimated logistic regression models using generalized
   estimated equations on monthly repeated measurements to determine and
   characterize the extent to which peer networks influenced the initiation
   and discontinuation of PSS prescribing, controlling for network,
   clinician, and caseload characteristics. Innovators were defined as
   individuals initiating PSS prior to May 2020, and early adopters were
   individuals initiating PSS after.ResultsAmong 14,137 prescribers
   treating clients with substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators
   of prescribed safer supply and 1062 early adopters through the end of
   study follow-up, but 653 (50.6\%) were no longer prescribing by August
   2021. Prescribers with over 20\% of peers whom had adopted PSS had a
   nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing themselves (aOR:
   3.79, 95\% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those with no connected safer
   supply prescribers.ConclusionsThe uptake of PSS in BC was highly
   dependent on the behavior of prescribers' peer networks. Future
   implementation strategies to support PSS or other policies would benefit
   from leveraging networks of prescribers.},

  year = {2019},
  volume = {128},
  month = {DEC},
  abstract = {Background: Frailty remains a challenge in the aging research area with
   a number of gaps in knowledge still to be filled. Frailty seems to
   behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter.
   Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was
   the main purpose of our study.
   Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012,
   mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit
   frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The
   edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning,
   and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic
   graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms,
   hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the
   graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and
   tertiles of the total FI score.
   Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8\%
   were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of
   connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As
   the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how
   the nodes are connected changed.
   Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network.
   Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health
   (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits
   related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are
   considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with
   vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all
   deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and
   non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the
   construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify
   the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the
   development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of
   frailty in older adults.},

  abstract = {Introduction Children with inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) often
   have complex and intensive healthcare needs and their families face
   challenges in receiving high-quality, family centred health services.
   Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple
   components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This
   study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of
   children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and
   analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be
   used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter
   experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care
   map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months.
   Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis.
   Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of
   healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions
   will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative
   data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be
   summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and
   purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for
   stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one
   videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data
   regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will
   be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be
   merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care
   experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and
   presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a
   theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display.
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved
   by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board,
   the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics
   boards of each participating study centre. Findings will be published in
   peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.},

  abstract = {The Chinese healthcare system faces a dilemma between its
   hospital-centric approach to healthcare delivery and a rapidly ageing
   population that requires strong primary care. To improve system
   efficiency and continuity of care, the Hierarchical Medical System (HMS)
   policy package was issued in November 2014 and fully implemented in 2015
   in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. This study aimed to investigate the
   impact of the HMS on the local healthcare system. We conducted a
   repeated cross-sectional study with quarterly data collected between
   2010 and 2018 from Yinzhou district, Ningbo. The data were analysed with
   an interrupted time series design to assess the impact of HMS on the
   changes in levels and trends of three outcome variables: primary care
   physicians' (PCPs') patient encounter ratio (i.e. the mean quarterly
   number of patient encounters of PCPs divided by that of all other
   physicians), PCP degree ratio (i.e. the mean degree of PCPs divided by
   the mean degree of all other physicians, with the mean degree revealing
   the mean activity and popularity of physicians, which reflected the
   extent to which he/she coordinated with others in delivering health
   services), and PCP betweenness centrality ratio (i.e. the mean
   betweenness centrality of PCPs divided by the mean betweenness
   centrality of all other physicians; the mean betweenness centrality was
   interpreted as the mean relative importance of physicians within the
   network, indicating the centrality of the network). Observed results
   were compared with counterfactual scenarios computed based on pre-HMS
   trends. Between January 2010 and December 2018, 272 267 patients visited
   doctors for hypertension, a representative non-communicable disease with
   a high prevalence of 44.7\% among adults aged 35-75 years, amounting to
   a total of 9 270 974 patient encounters. We analysed quarterly data of
   45 464 observations over 36 time points. Compared to the counterfactual,
   by the fourth quarter of 2018, the PCP patient encounter ratio rose by
   42.7\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 27.1-58.2, P < 0.001], the PCP
   degree ratio increased by 23.6\% (95\%CI: 8.6-38.5, P < 0.01) and the
   PCP betweenness centrality ratio grew by 129.4\% (95\%CI: 87.1-171.7, P
   < 0.001). The HMS policy can incentivize patients to visit primary care
   facilities and enhance the centrality of PCPs within their professional
   network.},

  title = {User Behaviors and User-Generated Content in Chinese Online Health
   Communities: Comparative Study},
  journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {23},

  month = {DEC 15},
  abstract = {Background: Online health communities (OHCs) have increasingly gained
   traction with patients, caregivers, and supporters globally. Chinese
   OHCs are no exception. However, user-generated content (UGC) and the
   associated user behaviors in Chinese OHCs are largely underexplored and
   rarely analyzed systematically, forfeiting valuable opportunities for
   optimizing treatment design and care delivery with insights gained from
   OHCs.
   Objective: This study aimed to reveal both the shared and distinct
   characteristics of 2 popular OHCs in China by systematically and
   comprehensively analyzing their UGC and the associated user behaviors.
   Methods: We concentrated on studying the lung cancer forum (LCF) and
   breast cancer forum (BCF) on Mijian, and the diabetes consultation forum
   (DCF) on Sweet Home, because of the importance of the 3 diseases among
   Chinese patients and their prevalence on Chinese OHCs in general. Our
   analysis explored the key user activities, small-world effect, and
   scale-free characteristics of each social network. We examined the UGC
   of these forums comprehensively and adopted the weighted knowledge
   network technique to discover salient topics and latent relations among
   these topics on each forum. Finally, we discussed the public health
   implications of our analysis findings.
   Results: Our analysis showed that the number of reads per thread on each
   forum followed gamma distribution (H-L=0, H-B=0, and H-D=0); the number
   of replies on each forum followed exponential distribution (adjusted
   R-L(2) =0.946, adjusted R-B(2)=0.958, and adjusted R-D(2) =0.971); and
   the number of threads a user is involved with (adjusted R-L(2)=0.978,
   adjusted R-B(2)=0.964, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.970), the number of
   followers of a user (adjusted R-L(2)=0.989, adjusted R-B(2)=0.962, and
   adjusted R-D(2)=0.990), and a user's degrees (adjusted R-L(2)=0.997,
   adjusted R-B(2)=0.994, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.968) all followed power-law
   distribution. The study further revealed that users are generally more
   active during weekdays, as commonly witnessed in all 3 forums. In
   particular, the LCF and DCF exhibited high temporal similarity
   (rho=0.927; P<.001) in terms of the relative thread posting frequencies
   during each hour of the day. Besides, the study showed that all 3 forums
   exhibited the small-world effect (mean sigma(L)=517.15, mean
   sigma(B)=275.23, and mean sigma(D)=525.18) and scale-free
   characteristics, while the global clustering coefficients were lower
   than those of counterpart international OHCs. The study also discovered
   several hot topics commonly shared among the 3 disease forums, such as
   disease treatment, disease examination, and diagnosis. In particular,
   the study found that after the outbreak of COVID-19, users on the LCF
   and BCF were much more likely to bring up COVID-19-related issues while
   discussing their medical issues.
   Conclusions: UGC and related online user behaviors in Chinese OHCs can
   be leveraged as important sources of information to gain insights
   regarding individual and population health conditions. Effective and
   timely mining and utilization of such content can continuously provide
   valuable firsthand clues for enhancing the situational awareness of
   health providers and policymakers.},

   transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus},
  journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {178},
  month = {MAY},
  abstract = {Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding
   an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for
   identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen
   dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can
   spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity.
   Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less
   commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly
   consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The
   objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement
   versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an
   economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the
   U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such
   data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and
   elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we
   construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the
   networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been
   recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We
   evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and
   evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying
   network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case
   occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via
   network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local
   area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways,
   though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of
   case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x
   higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network
   k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random
   expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p <
   0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on
   proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance
   than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of
   local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall
   levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement
   network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread
   transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network
   analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of
   between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of
   transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and
   highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon
   heterogeneities in network connectivity.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aimed to apply a systems thinking approach to
   explore factors influencing the detection of emerging drug trends in
   Canada's provinces and territories to better understand how the local
   context can influence the design and performance of a pan-Canadian
   (i.e., national) substance use early warning system (EWS). This study
   also presents a set of actionable recommendations arising from the
   results.Methodology and methodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted
   with 13 purposively recruited Medical Officers of Health and
   epidemiologists from across Canada working in the field of substance
   use. Thematic and social network analysis guided by the socio-technical
   systems framework were subsequently employed.ResultsBarriers and
   facilitators for detecting emerging drug trends in provinces and
   territories are a product of the collective linkages and interactions
   between social (objectives, people, culture), technical (tools,
   practices, infrastructure), and external environmental (financial,
   regulatory frameworks, stakeholders) factors. Shortcomings in several of
   these areas shaped the system's behaviour and together contributed to
   fragmented operations that lacked strategic focus, poorly designed
   cross-sector partnerships, and unactionable information outputs.
   Participants' experiences shaped perceptions of a national substance use
   EWS, with some voicing potential opportunities and others expressing
   doubts about its effectiveness.ConclusionThis study highlights
   interconnected social, technical, and external environmental
   considerations for the design and implementation of a national substance
   use EWS in Canada. It also demonstrates the value of using the
   socio-technical systems framework to understand a complex public health
   surveillance issue and how it can be used to inform a path forward.

              COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs social network analysis for

              the 3 countries show different characteristics of social networks
              for COVID-19. For example, the Prime Minister plays the second
              most important role in the Canadian networks, whereas the
              Presidents play the most significant role in them, in the US, and
              Mexico. WHO shows a pivotal effect on social networks of COVID-19

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Weight-related behaviors are determined
              by multiple individual and contextual factors, with recent
              evidence implicating personal social networks (PSNs). Greater
              understanding of these relationships could help inform healthy
              weight promoting interventions. We conducted a feasibility study
              among youth at risk of obesity to document process outcomes, to
              discern relationships between PSN features and weight-related
              behaviors, and to generate hypotheses with respect to perceived
              social support (SS) and sex. Methods: Participants (egos)
              nominated up to 10 people (alters) with whom they discussed
              important matters. Egos reported their own and each alter's age,
              sex, body shape, lifestyle behaviors, relation, frequency of
              exercising with each alter, and of being encouraged by each alter
              to exercise. We examined relationships between PSN features and
              weight-related outcomes and explored the role of SS, using both
              correlational and linear regression analyses. Results: There were
              45 participants (mean age 16.4 years) and body mass index z-score
              (zBMI) ranged from -1.2 to 3.9. There were few missing responses
              to PSN items; broad variation across most items, including SS
              scores, was reported. Correlations pointed to plausible
              relationships implicating PSN features and lifestyle behaviors.
              In exploratory analyses, network-based SS was positively
              associated with adiposity in girls and negatively associated in
              boys, while lifestyle role modelling was not associated with
              adiposity. Conclusions: Our findings support the feasibility of
              measuring the PSN in youth and the potential for using social

  author = {Paola Pascual-Ferr{\a'a} and Neil Alperstein and Daniel J Barnett},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use
              of social network analysis to understand public discourse on
              Twitter around the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. We examined different network properties that might
              affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public
              health messages from public health officials and health agencies.
              METHODS: We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key
              communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We
              used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly
              available data from social media sites such as Twitter. RESULTS:
              We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is
              highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these
              characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public
              health messages in a network. Competing conversations and
              misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way
              that imperil public health. CONCLUSIONS: Looking at basic metrics
              might create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk
              communication efforts on social media if not analyzed within the
              context of the larger network. Social network analysis of
              conversations on social media should be an integral part of how

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Somali immigrants and refugees to the United States
              are at high risk for obesity and related cardiovascular risk.
              Social network factors influence health behaviors and are
              important contributors to the obesity epidemic. The objective of
              this study was to describe social networks and obesity-related
              characteristics among adult Somali immigrants in a Minnesota city
              in order to inform a community-based, participatory,
              research-derived, social network intervention to decrease obesity
              rates. METHODS: Survey data (demographics, general health
              measures, and sociobehavioral and network measures) and height
              and weight measures (for calculating body mass index) were
              collected from adult Somali immigrants by bilingual study team
              members at community locations. Descriptive statistics were used
              to report the survey and biometric data. Logistic regression
              models were used to describe the basic associations of
              participants and network factors. Network data were analyzed to
              identify nodes and ties, to visualize the network, and to
              identify potential interventionists for a future social network
              intervention. RESULTS: Of the 646 participants, 50\% were
              overweight or affected by obesity. The network had 1703 nodes
              with 3583 ties between nodes, and modularity was high (0.75).
              Compared with respondents of normal weight, participants who were
              overweight or affected by obesity had more network members who
              were also overweight or obese (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95\% CI,
              1.11-7.56; P = .03); this was most notable for men (OR, 4.58;
              95\% CI, 1.22-17.22; P = .02) and suggestive for those 50 years
              or older (OR, 24.23; 95\% CI, 1.55-377.83; P = .03). Weight loss
              intention among participants who were overweight or affected by
              obesity was associated with number of family members and friends
              trying to lose weight, enabling functional network factors
              (social norms for weight loss, social support for healthy eating,
              and social cohesion), and less favorable obesogenic social norms.
              CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample of Somali immigrants,
              distinct social networks are clustered by weight status, and
              social contacts and functional network characteristics are
              related to individuals' weight loss intentions. These factors
              should be considered in weight loss interventions and programs. A
              social network intervention targeting weight loss, within a
              community-based participatory research framework, is feasible in
              this vulnerable population.},

              subsequent national lockdown on the social media platform
              Twitter. NodeXL Pro software was used to collect tweets using the
              terms 'food' and 'poverty' in any order somewhere in a tweet sent
              on selected days between April 5 and May 23, 2020. The data
              obtained from NodeXL Pro were cleaned. Social network analysis
              tools were used to analyse and visualise our data. Using this
              method, sentiment-related words (positive or negative words), the
              top (the most mentioned) 10 hashtags, top words and top word
              pairs were identified. The patterns of word pairs communicated in
              our network were visualised based on each word pair's frequency.
              This also enabled us to carry out a content analysis to create
              coding of the word pairs' data. A total of 81 249 tweets were
              identified that contained the terms 'food' and 'poverty'. Our
              findings revealed that individuals' tweets overwhelmingly
              contained views about the increase in hunger, food poverty and
              food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter users
              perceived that when the pandemic measures began, many food-secure
              families were pushed into food insecurity due to a rapid rise in
              unemployment and rising poverty due to the quarantine and
              stay-at-home instructions in place at the time. They also
              addressed the sharp rise in food poverty being driven by panic
              buying, food shortages, food affordability and disruptions in
              food supply and food systems. Our analysis of this data suggests
              that to mitigate food poverty or to prevent a 'hunger pandemic'
              for future pandemic emergencies, comprehensive and longer term
              policy responses and economic supports are needed to strengthen
              the resilience of food systems. However, the highlighted

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus carriage increases the risk of
              infection. We used social network analysis to evaluate whether
              contacts have the same S. aureus genotype indicating direct
              transmission or whether contagiousness is an indirect effect of
              contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. METHODS:
              The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among
              1038 high school students. S. aureus carriage was determined from
              two nasal swab cultures and the genotype was determined by
              spa-typing of positive throat swabs. RESULTS: S. aureus carriage
              and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (P < 0.001).
              The probability of carriage increased by 5\% for each S. aureus
              positive contact. Male sex was associated with a 15\% lower risk
              of transmission compared to the female sex, although the carriage
              prevalence was higher for men (36\% vs 24\%). Students with
              medium physical activity levels, medium/high alcohol use, or
              normal weight had a higher number of contacts and an increased
              risk of transmission (P < 0.002). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the
              direct social transmission of S. aureus. Lifestyle factors are
              associated with the risk of transmission, suggesting the effects
              of indirect social groups on S. aureus carriage, such as friends
              having more similar environmental exposures. The male
              predominance in the carriage is determined by sex-specific
              predisposing host characteristics as the social transmission is
              less frequent in males than females. Information on social
              networks may add to a better understanding of S. aureus

              disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities
              worldwide. Outbreaks in US nursing homes have persisted despite
              nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early
              report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
              identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a
              likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland,

              connections between nursing homes-and the role these connections
              serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is
              currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on
              cross-facility employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of

              device-level geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to
              substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions
              can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the
              pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze
              discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the
              sentiments toward COVID-19. METHODS: This study applied machine
              learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to
              analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating
              exclusively in the United States and written in English during
              the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study
              examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
              sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social
              network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed
              positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of
              the tweets was also conducted. RESULTS: There were a total of
              14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and
              641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of
              902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254
              (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%)
              as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study
              identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets:
              health care environment, emotional support, business economy,
              social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New
              Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the
              most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah,
              Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most
              positive sentiment. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 5
              prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging
              from positive to negative. These themes and sentiments can
              clarify the public's response to COVID-19 and help officials
              navigate the pandemic.},

              2019},
  author = {Emily Mendenhall and Merrill Singer},
  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to describe what
              methods were used for 60 articles on HIV syndemics in 2019, where
              they took place, what syndemic clusters emerged, and why this
              matters. RECENT FINDINGS: Most articles published in 2019 used
              regression analyses, and fewer used higher level modeling
              techniques, frequencies and descriptive, longitudinal cohort
              study, and social network analysis. Some employed ethnography,
              qualitative interviews, or were simply reviews. Most syndemic
              co-factors were substance abuse, risky sexual behavior,
              depression, intimate partner violence, stigma, sexually
              transmitted infections, and trauma and non-communicable diseases.
              Half of the studies were conducted in the United States and
              mostly in urban areas. Other contexts were Canada, Kenya, Uganda,
              Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Botswana, Jamaica, Dominican
              Republic, India, Indonesia, China, Peru, and Romania. SUMMARY:
              Most recommendations suggested that people living with HIV need
              interventions that address other factors situated within their
              life, such as their mental health, social stigma, experiences of
              trauma and intimate partner violence, and social stigma and
              sexual risk taking. Many took an intersectoral approach and
              emphasized the need to consider the various factors that shape
              experiences with HIV, from sex, sexuality, class, race and
              ethnicity, and past trauma.},

  abstract = {We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel
              coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to
              assess the potential of SNA as a tool for outbreak monitoring and
              control. We analysed contact tracing data of 1147 COVID-19
              positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99\% aged 11-40, 742
              males), anonymised and made public by the Karnataka government.
              Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to create SNA
              graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and
              edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree
              was 1-47 for 199 (17.35\%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89
              (7.76\%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher
              mean betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44\%
              cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229,
              20\%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four
              (2.96\%) 'super-spreaders' (outdegree ⩾ 5) caused 60\% of the
              transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can allow
              healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint
              key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and
              individuals for rigorous containment could help minimise resource
              outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in

  abstract = {Urbanisation and common mental disorders (CMDs; ie, depressive,
              anxiety, and substance use disorders) are increasing worldwide.
              In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate
              to each other and call for a complexity science approach to
              advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an
              ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in
              191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with
              a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly
              for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic
              studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We
              identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social
              urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs.
              We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to
              operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with
              individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and
              neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an
              urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales
              and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour
              characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time.
              We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health
              research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by
              discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network
              analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling)
              could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment
              and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens in an urban context.},

              Analysis of Twitter Bots during the {COVID-19} Pandemic},
  author = {Zixuan Weng and Aijun Lin},
  abstract = {Social media is not only an essential platform for the
              dissemination of public health-related information, but also an
              important channel for people to communicate during the COVID-19
              pandemic. However, social bots can interfere with the social
              media topics that humans follow. We analyzed and visualized
              Twitter data during the prevalence of the Wuhan lab leak theory
              and discovered that 29\% of the accounts participating in the
              discussion were social bots. We found evidence that social bots
              play an essential mediating role in communication networks.
              Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the
              information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect
              influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and
              through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to
              messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified
              messages across social media. These findings show that limiting

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cannabis is an illegal psychoactive substance that's
              use is widespread among adolescents. During adolescence, many
              changes can cause stress. In this phase, the group of friends
              becomes increasingly important, being a situation of
              vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an
              escape mechanism or due to peer's influence. Therefore, the
              purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the structure of
              the consumption and friendship network, the intention to use
              cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: An
              online platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were
              used for data collection. RESULTS: The sample consisted of
              adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from a third-year class of
              compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (Le{\'o}n, Spain).
              Significant differences were obtained concerning consumption

              Social Network Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a
              picture of the context in which adolescents are located. In the

              Analysis of Twitter Data},
  author = {Wasim Ahmed and Josep Vidal-Alaball and Joseph Downing and Francesc {L{\a'o}pez Segu{\a'\i}}},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus
              disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has
              led to increased discussions across online platforms. These
              conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by
              social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G
              to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the
              burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of
              the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate
              and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE:
              The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the
              drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to
              deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a
              social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from
              a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4,
              2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on
              Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed
              through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were
              ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's
              vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore
              algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined.
              RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest
              network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast
              group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an
              authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation.
              Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\%
              (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\%
              (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0\% (n=77) were
              general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions.
              Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory
              supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted
              high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the
              conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were
              the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube
              videos were also shared. The study also identified an account
              whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter.
              CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted interventions
              oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key
              to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against
              the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets
              inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that
              policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions
              that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide
              users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which
              should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G
              conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering
              practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context
              of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate
              basic epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also
              be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of
              transmission at the individual patient level. Characterization of
              individuals based on different levels of infectiousness could
              better inform the contact tracing interventions at field levels.
              METHODS: Standard social network analysis methods used for
              exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed
              to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2
              patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set
              with diagnosed patients as ``nodes'' and their epidemiological
              contact as ``edges'' was created. Directed network perspective
              was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a
              ``source patient'' towards a ``target patient''. Network measures
              of `` degree centrality'' and ``betweenness centrality'' were
              calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission
              of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify
              patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was
              used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used
              to categorize influencers. RESULTS: Out-degree centrality
              measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27\%
              (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19\%
              (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12)
              patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have
              collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients.
              Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93)
              patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus
              have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network
              component analysis identified nineteen connected components
              comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted
              for 26.95\% of total patients (1959) and 68.74\% of
              epidemiological contacts in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Social
              network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would
              be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in
              disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual
              patients and patient components who have disproportionately
              contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical
              tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators
              and could help improve the contact tracing activities.},

              analysis compared cases to control indicating significant
              differences in the overall structure of the networks. A GIS
              visual representation of these metrics was developed, showing
              spatial variation across the example hospital floor. DISCUSSION:
              This study confirmed the importance that intra-hospital patient
              networks play in the transmission of HAIs, highlighting
              opportunities for interventions utilising these data. Due to
              spatial variation differences, further research is necessary to
              confirm this is not a localised phenomenon, but instead a common
              situation occurring within many hospitals. CONCLUSION: Utilising
              SNA and GIS analysis in conjunction with one another provided a
              data-rich environment in which the risk inherent in
              intra-hospital transfer networks was quantified, visualised and
              interpreted for potential interventions.},

              A social network analysis approach},
  author = {Vanessa {Silva E Silva} and Janine Schirmer and Bartira {de Aguiar Roza} and Aimee Sarti and Michael Hickey and Sonny Dhanani and Joan Almost and Markus Schafer and Joan Tranmer},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transplant rates in Ontario rose steeply in the
              decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for that increase
              remain unclear, but the inter-organizational arrangement of organ
              donation programs may have contributed. However, there is a
              paucity of literature investigating these inter-organizational
              arrangements, with a limited understanding of how communication
              facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may
              help to re-establish rising organ donation rates post-pandemic.
              OBJECTIVE: To describe interprofessional interactions of Organ
              and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) during organ donation
              cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, from an
              organizational perspective (describing structure, context,
              process). METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA)
              approach analyzing 14 organ donation cases just before the
              COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social network graphs
              depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with
              a great part of the communication being processed through the
              OTDC. CONTEXT: Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across
              cases, and health care professionals perceived an atmosphere of
              shared vision and trust among team members. PROCESS: Most
              networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a
              decentralized information flow, and participants perceived
              decisions being jointly made. The characteristic path length of
              cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, suggesting potential for rapid
              information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced the OTDC role of
              intermediator within the communication process, and hospital
              staff perceived OTDCs as central players. Hospital staff and
              OTDCs reported frustration with some aspects of the flow of
              information during the organ allocation processes. CONCLUSION:
              Findings from this study provide a network map of communications
              within organ donation cases and reinforce the importance of the
              OTDC role. Opportunities for quality improvement within these
              processes are identified.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study used a Social network analysis (SNA)
              approach to describe HIV transmission and venue affiliations
              among social and sexual networks of young men who have sex with
              men (YMSM) in Houston, TX. METHODS: A total of 34 YMSM indices
              aged 18-23 years and 23 of their network members were interviewed
              about their social and sexual networks and venues at which they
              met and spent time. RESULTS: Participants reported information on
              220 friends (mean age = 25.3 years) and 112 sexual partners (mean
              age = 26.3 years). Participants spent time with friends and
              sexual partners at similar venues but relied more heavily on
              social media and dating applications to meet sexual partners.
              Participants lived in zip codes consistent with high
              concentrations of HIV positivity. Popularly frequented clubs/gay
              bars were often 10-20 miles away, also in zip codes with high
              densities of seropositivity. CONCLUSION: Both friendship and
              sexual networks are large, diffuse, and not limited by geography.
              Participants came from areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS. The
              venues at which participants recruited sexual partners may
              present increased opportunities for HIV transmission. HIV

  title = {Mental health disorders and adolescent peer relationships},
  author = {Emily Long and Maria Gardani and Mark McCann and Helen Sweeting and Mark Tranmer and Laurence Moore},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: Mental health disorders often arise during
              adolescence, with disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety
              disorders among the most common. Given the salience of peer
              relationships during adolescence, and research suggesting that
              mental health disorders negatively impact social functioning,
              this study uses novel methodology from social network analysis to
              uncover the social processes linking disruptive behavior
              disorders and anxiety disorders with adolescent friendships. In
              particular, the study focuses on peer withdrawal, peer
              popularity, and peer homophily in relation to both disorders.
              METHODS: Data come from 15-year old students in four Scottish
              secondary schools (N = 602). Diagnoses of disruptive behavior
              disorders and anxiety disorders were produced using the
              Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, and peer relationship
              data were obtained through a friendship nomination survey.
              Exponential random graph models were used to estimate the
              probability of peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer
              homophily based on each disorder. RESULTS: Results demonstrated
              that adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders were more
              popular than their peers without disruptive behavior disorders
              (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). Friendship was also more likely
              between two adolescents both with or both without disruptive
              behavior disorders (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), demonstrating peer
              homophily. There was no evidence that anxiety disorders were
              related to adolescent peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
              from this study suggest that disruptive behavior disorders may be
              socially rewarded (e.g., peer popularity) and socially clustered
              (e.g., homophily), whereas anxiety disorders show no such trends.
              Thus, intervention efforts must account for the peer social
              status that may be gained from engaging in disruptive behavior
              during this developmental period. Further, given that similarity
              in DBD status is associated with an increased likelihood of
              friendship, adolescents are likely to be surrounded by peers who
              reinforce their behaviors.},

              context of an escalating drug overdose epidemic in North America,
              investigating how network structure may affect vulnerability to
              rapid HIV transmission is necessary for preventing outbreaks. We
              compared the characteristics of the observed contact tracing
              network from the 2015 outbreak in rural Indiana with 1000
              networks generated by an agent-based network model with
              approximately the same number of individuals (n = 420) and ties
              between them (n = 913). We introduced an initial HIV infection
              into the simulated networks and compared the subsequent epidemic
              behavior (e.g., cumulative HIV infections over 5 years). The
              model was able to produce networks with largely comparable
              characteristics and total numbers of incident HIV infections.
              Although the model was unable to produce networks with comparable
              cohesiveness (where the observed network had a transitivity value
              35.7 standard deviations from the mean of the simulated
              networks), the structural variability of the simulated networks
              allowed for investigation into their potential facilitation of
              HIV transmission. These findings emphasize the need for continued
              development of injection network simulation studies in tandem

              characteristics played a role in this and future outbreaks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Brain Tumor Social Media (\#BTSM) Twitter hashtag
              was founded in February 2012 as a disease-specific hashtag for
              patients with brain tumor. OBJECTIVE: To understand \#BTSM's role
              as a patient support system, we describe user descriptors,
              growth, interaction, and content sharing. METHODS: We analyzed
              all tweets containing \#BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur
              Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined
              user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. We
              created a network plot with all publicly available retweets
              involving \#BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their
              connections to other users. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, 59,764
              unique users participated in \#BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. The
              yearly volume of \#BTSM tweets increased by 264.57\% from 16,394
              in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with \#BTSM constantly trending in the
              top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet
              chats. Patient advocates generated the most \#BTSM tweets
              (33.13\%), while advocacy groups, caregivers, doctors, and
              researchers generated 7.01\%, 4.63\%, 3.86\%, and 3.37\%,
              respectively. Physician use, although still low, has increased
              over time. The 2018 network plot of retweets including \#BTSM
              identifies a number of key stakeholders from the patient
              advocate, patient organization, and medical researcher domains
              and reveals the extent of their reach to other users.
              CONCLUSIONS: From its start in 2012, \#BTSM has grown
              exponentially over time. We believe its growth suggests its
              potential as a global source of brain tumor information on
              Twitter for patients, advocates, patient organizations as well as
              health care professionals and researchers.},

  author = {A H Cabezas and M W Sanderson and C Y Lockhart and K A Riley and C J Hanthorn},
  abstract = {Livestock movements are a common pathway for the spread
              infectious diseases in a population. An understanding of
              livestock movement patterns is needed to understand national
              transmission risks of highly infectious diseases during
              epidemics. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an approach that
              helps to describe the relationships among individuals and the
              implications of those relationships. We used SNA to describe the
              contact structure of livestock movements throughout the
              contiguous U.S. from April 1(st), 2015 to March 31(st), 2016. We
              describe 4 network types: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and
              small ruminant. Livestock movement data were sourced from
              Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) while
              county-level farm demographic data were from the National
              Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In the described
              networks, nodes are represented by counties and arcs by shipments
              between nodes; the networks were weighted based on the number of
              shipments between nodes. For the analyses, movement data were
              aggregated at the county level and on an annual basis. Measures
              of centrality and cohesiveness were computed and identification
              of trade-communities in all networks was conducted. During the
              study period, a total of 219,042 movements were recorded and beef
              cattle movements accounted for 63 \% of all movements. At least
              70 \% of U.S. counties were present in each of the networks, but
              the density of arcs was less than 2\% in all networks. In the
              beef cattle network, counties with high out-degree were strongly
              correlated (0.8) with the number of beef cows per county while
              for the dairy cattle network a strong correlation (>0.86) was
              found with the number of dairy cattle per km(2) at the county
              level. All networks were found to have between 4 and 6 large
              communities (50 counties or more per community), and were
              geographically clustered except for the communities in the small
              ruminant network. Outputs reported in these analyses can help to
              understand the structure of the contact networks for beef cattle,
              dairy cattle, swine, and small ruminants. They may also be used
              in conjunction with simulation modeling to evaluate spread of
              highly infectious disease such as foot-and-mouth disease at the
              national level and to evaluate the application of intervention
              strategies.},

              incidence in a large population of zoo birds},
  author = {Carmel Witte and Florin Vaida and Rebecca Papendick and Laura L Hungerford and Bruce A Rideout and James H Fowler},
  abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of
              avian mycobacteriosis spread through a social network.
              Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of
              connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether
              this pattern can distinguish between different sources of
              infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals
              nested in a larger population of birds that were closely
              monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014).
              A retrospective cohort study design and social network
              connectivity were used to estimate the association between
              exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis.
              Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and
              network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over
              discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable
              longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined
              whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and
              indirectly-connected, was associated with development of
              mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed
              an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio =
              2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48-3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were
              directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another
              infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a
              positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was
              independently associated with an increased risk of
              mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11-2.19). This
              association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect
              contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never
              had contact with the subject of interest or its environment.
              Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type
              of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis.
              Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to
              develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and
              those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of
              the contact (same species versus different species) were also
              significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were
              sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation
              time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the
              social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We
              provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some
              of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility
              based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when
              large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation
              efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be
              effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while
              enhancing population sustainability.},

              had experienced at least one physical or sexual violence after
              their 15. Taking into account the severe health consequences, the
              Emergency Department (ED), may offer an opportunity to recognize

              selected and, for each woman, the ED history of diagnoses and
              traumas was reconstructed. SNA was applied on all these diagnoses
              and traumas, including also 9 specific violence diagnoses. SNA
              community detection algorithms and network centrality measures
              were used to detect diagnostic patterns more strongly associated
              to violence. A logistic model was developed to validate the
              capability of these patterns to predict the odds for a woman of
              having an history of violence. Model results were summed up into
              a risk chart. RESULTS: Among women experiencing an aggression,
              SNA identified four communities representing specific
              violence-related patterns of diagnoses. Diagnoses having a
              central role in the violence network were alcohol or substance
              abuse, pregnancy-related conditions and psychoses. These
              high-risk violence related patterns accounted for at most 20\% of
              our cohort. The logistic model had good predictive accuracy and
              predictive power confirming that diagnosis patterns identified
              through the SNA are meaningful in the violence recognition.
              CONCLUSIONS: Routine ED data, analyzed using SNA, can be a
              first-line warning to recognize when an aggression related access
              is part of the spectrum of gender-based violence against women.
              Increasing the available number of predictors, such procedures
              may be proven to support ED staff in identifying early signs of
              violence to adequately support the victims and mitigate the
              harms.},

  abstract = {(1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific
              production, collaboration among countries, and research topics
              focusing on pediatric obesity. (2) Methods: The papers that were
              included in the study were retrieved from the Web of Science Core
              Collection from Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis of
              several focuses, including journals of publication, subject
              categories, most frequent author keywords, and journal impact
              factors, was conducted. Social network analysis was used to
              recognize collaboration groups between countries and the
              co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A total of 12,171
              research articles were published in 2036 journals classified
              under a variety of subject areas, with pediatrics (27.7\%),
              nutrition and dietetics (18.5\%), and public environmental and
              occupational health (18.4\%) accounting for the most frequent
              study areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International
              Journal of Obesity (299), and BMC Public Health being the most
              productive journals. The main challenges identified for pediatric
              obesity include general topics such as physical activity,
              nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as other more specific
              challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, eating
              behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4) Conclusions: We
              observed a growth rate in the number of published articles of
              59.8\%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the topic.
              The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There
              has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with
              countries across five continents being involved. The results of
              the thematic analysis reveal the importance of exercise and
              nutrition-related topics along with specialized health terms and
              terms related to public health.},

  title = {Leadership in informal stormwater governance networks},
  author = {Brian C Chaffin and Theresa M Floyd and Sandra L Albro},
  abstract = {Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater,
              specifically developments that leverage the environmental and
              social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including
              infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require
              capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or
              regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward
              green stormwater infrastructure have been shepherded by networks
              of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from
              governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is,
              not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal
              agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal
              hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed
              the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of
              these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance
              networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and
              characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI
              for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and
              administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to
              individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management
              professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected
              network data on individual relationships, including collaboration
              and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on
              peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings
              suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and
              individual position within the network-specifically, betweenness
              centrality and openness-defined and likely supported leaders in
              the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this
              non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to
              be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women,
              not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on
              single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of
              this research suggest that informal environmental governance
              networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ
              substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of
              organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and
              regional authorities grappling with complex environmental
              challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess
              stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources

              public conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use
              a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over
              26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June
              7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to identify
              spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their
              interaction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We
              identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are
              able to link them to international groups mainly involved in
              science and health topics, national elites, and political actors.
              The science- and health-related super-community received
              disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was
              leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic
              unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and
              political actors, paralleled by the introduction of
              country-specific containment measures and the growing
              politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained
              present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became
              more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network
              communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification
              and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information
              from international health organizations or scientific authorities
              to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged
              time. These results may have implications for information

              During the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people who tested
              positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced long COVID, which attracted
              the attention of researchers. This study aims to assess the

              extracted 784 publications from Scopus in the field of long
              COVID. According to bibliometric analysis, it is found that:
              developed countries in Europe and America were in leading
              positions in terms of paper productivity and citations. The

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol use and abuse constitute a major public
              health problem and identifying their determinants is a priority.
              Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of
              social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A
              growing number of studies have used social network analysis to
              examine how social network characteristics influence adult
              alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been
              systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper
              systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network
              analysis to assess the influence of social network
              characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS: A
              literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of
              Science databases and a review of the reference lists of
              retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers
              independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further
              screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their
              eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged
              eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among
              young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up
              visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The
              objectives and methods of the included studies were
              heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically
              significant association between a social network characteristic
              and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network
              members drinking behaviors were associated with participants'
              drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION: In young adults,
              among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted,
              with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be
              associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across
              methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the
              relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups,
              and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks
              appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young
              adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help
              reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.},

              which exposure to self-harm related content may occur. N = 477
              participants completed an online study, including questions
              regarding lifetime history of self-harm thoughts and behaviours
              and the frequency with which they had been exposed to self-harm
              via various mediums. Gaussian Markov random field network models
              were estimated using graphical LASSO and extended Bayesian
              information criterion. Bootstrapping revealed that exposure
              mediums with a direct connection to self-harm thoughts and
              behaviours were the internet (rrp = .34, 95\% CI [.26, .42]) and
              in-passing 'miscellaneous' exposure (rrp = .14, 95\% CI [.00,

              Social Network Analysis of Twitter Data},
  author = {Wasim Ahmed and Francesc {L{\a'o}pez Segu{\a'\i}} and Josep Vidal-Alaball and Matthew S Katz},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy
              theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic
              is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are ``empty.''
              Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases
              the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice
              about social distancing and other public health interventions.
              Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it
              is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of
              misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. OBJECTIVE: This
              study set out to evaluate the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy
              theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind
              it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which
              online sources of information were used as evidence to support
              the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the
              network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread
              of such a conspiracy theory in the future. METHODS: Twitter data
              related to the \#FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and
              analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from
              April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and
              11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify
              accounts with a higher probability of being bots. RESULTS: The
              most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary
              citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit
              supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most
              linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a
              verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more
              influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated
              accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network.
              CONCLUSIONS: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can
              be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing
              misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their
              efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation.

              influencers in spreading antinarrative content.},

              disease transmission. METHODS: We collected social contact data
              in five villages and built SNA-informed village-specific
              stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar. A
              name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact
              networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by
              snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were
              aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and
              individual-level characteristics determining contact formation
              and structure were identified by fitting an exponential random
              graph model (ERGM), which formed the basis of the contact
              structure and model dynamics. Models were calibrated and used to
              evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and community resiliency
              to foreign TB introduction. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-village SNA
              showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with transitivity
              (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43. Active
              case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active
              TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all
              village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and
              without specific interventions, networks A and B showed
              resilience to both active and latent TB reintroduction, while
              Network C, the village network with the highest transitivity,
              lacked resiliency to reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence
              of 2\% and a TB mortality rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one
              new contagious infection post hypothetical elimination.
              CONCLUSION: In remote Madagascar, SNA-informed models suggest
              that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease (active TB)
              prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB) burden
              remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction
              decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down''
              population level TB models would most likely miss this difference
              between small communities. SNA bridges large-scale
              population-based and hyper focused community-level TB modeling.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Domestic workers, flight crews, and sailors are three
              vulnerable population subgroups who were required to travel due
              to occupational demand in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic.
              OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the social
              networks among three vulnerable population subgroups and capture
              temporal changes in their probability of being exposed to
              SARS-CoV-2 via mobility. METHODS: We included 652 COVID-19 cases
              and utilized Exponential Random Graph Models to build six social
              networks: one for the cross-sectional cohort, and five for the
              temporal wave cohorts, respectively. Vertices were the three
              vulnerable population subgroups. Edges were shared scenarios
              where vertices were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The
              probability of being exposed to a COVID-19 case in Hong Kong
              among the three vulnerable population subgroups increased from
              3.38\% in early 2020 to 5.78\% in early 2022. While domestic
              workers were less mobile intercontinentally compared to flight
              crews and sailors, domestic workers were 1.81-times in general
              more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable
              populations with similar ages and occupations, especially younger
              domestic workers and flight crew members, were more likely to be
              exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Social network analysis can be used to
              provide critical information on the health risks of infectious
              diseases to vulnerable populations.},

              identification, listing, and follow-up, which is a key to slowing

              study, we use the scientific collaboration network technique to
              explore the evolving history and scientific collaboration
              patterns of contact tracing. It is observed that the number of
              articles on the subject remained at a low level before 2020,
              probably because the practical significance of the contact
              tracing model was not widely accepted by the academic community.
              The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented research boom
              to contact tracing, as evidenced by the explosion of the
              literature after 2020. Tuberculosis, HIV, and other sexually
              transmitted diseases were common types of diseases studied in
              contact tracing before 2020. In contrast, research on contact
              tracing regarding COVID-19 occupies a significantly large
              proportion after 2000. It is also found from the collaboration
              networks that academic teams in the field tend to conduct
              independent research, rather than cross-team collaboration, which
              is not conducive to knowledge dissemination and information flow.},

              prevention and control of swine diseases in Argentina},
  author = {Jerome N Baron and Maria N Aznar and Mariela Monterubbianesi and Beatriz Mart{\a'\i}nez-L{\a'o}pez},
  abstract = {RATIONALE/BACKGROUND: Though much smaller than the bovine
              industry, the porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number
              of farms and represents a significant economic sector. In recent
              years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine
              movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and
              eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information
              can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between
              farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of
              emergence. METHODS: Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed
              in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which
              control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide
              cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was
              used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual
              farm and market level to help identify important nodes.
              Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed.
              Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different
              groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for
              mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The
              network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6
              million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units
              participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating.
              Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in
              shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within
              provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating
              61\% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are
              involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions
              with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical
              clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node
              characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and
              backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single
              outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION:
              Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal
              characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable
              information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective
              surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where
              efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and
              patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission
              models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of
              emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.},

  author = {Ngoc-Anh Thi Hoang and Thai Quang Pham and Ha-Linh Quach and Ngoc {Van Hoang} and Khanh Cong Nguyen and Duc-Anh Dang and Florian Vogt},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak in a major
              referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam led to 7664 patients and
              staff being sent into lockdown for 2 weeks, and more than 52,200
              persons across 49 provinces being quarantined. We assessed
              SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest
              hospital outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA).
              METHODS: We constructed a directed relational network and
              calculated network metrics for 'degree', 'betweenness',
              'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand
              individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network
              components and modularity to identify sub-network structures with
              disproportionately big effects. RESULTS: We detected 68
              connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 27 (58.7\%) were
              ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2\%) caregivers, 6 (13\%) patients
              and 2 (4.4\%) nurses. Among the 10 most important cases selected
              by each SNA network metric, transmission dynamics clustered in 17
              cases, of whom 12 (70.6\%) cases were ancillary support staff.
              Ancillary support staff also constituted 71.1\% of cases in the
              dominant sub-network and 68.8\% of cases in the three largest
              sub-communities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified non-clinical
              ancillary support staff, who are responsible for room service and
              food distribution in hospital wards in Vietnam, as a group with
              disproportionally big impacts on transmission dynamics during
              this outbreak. Our findings call for a holistic approach to
              nosocomial outbreak prevention and response that includes both
              clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. Our work also shows the
              potential of SNA as a complementary outbreak investigation method
              to better understand infection patterns in hospitals and similar
              settings.},

              Networking Platforms: Cross-sectional Study},
  author = {Piao-Yi Chiou and Chien-Ching Hung and Chien-Yu Chen},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) who undergo voluntary
              HIV counseling and testing (VCT) often report condomless anal
              sexual intercourse, having many sexual partners, and being
              exposed to risky sexual networks. Limited research has discussed
              the application of motivational interviewing and convenience
              referral platforms to facilitate the referral of sexual partners
              for HIV testing among MSM. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
              evaluate the effects of VCT referral by sexual partners through
              social networking platforms and the test results after elicited
              interviews with MSM; compare the characteristics and risk
              behaviors among MSM tested without referral, index subjects, and
              referred sexual partners; and explore unknown sexual affiliations
              through visualizing and quantifying the social network graph.
              METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Purposeful sampling
              was used to recruit index subjects from a community HIV screening
              station frequented by MSM in Taipei City on Friday and Saturday
              nights. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit sexual
              partners. Partner-elicited interviews were conducted by trained
              staff before VCT to motivate MSM to become index subjects and
              refer sexual partners via the Line app, or to disclose the
              accounts and profiles of sexual partners on relevant social
              networking platforms. Referred sexual partners received rapid HIV
              testing, and the recruitment process was repeated until leads
              were exhausted. RESULTS: After the interviews, 28.2\% (75/266) of
              MSM were successfully persuaded to become index subjects in the
              first wave, referring 127 sexual partners via the Line app for
              rapid HIV testing and disclosing 40 sexual partners. The index

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between social isolation and
              cognitive performance has been less investigated in
              low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC) and the presence of
              depression as a moderator on this association has not been
              examined. The authors examined the associations of social
              isolation and perceived loneliness with cognitive performance in
              the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. METHODS: In this
              cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a
              composite score including marital status, social contact, and
              social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive
              performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and
              temporal orientation tests. Linear and logistic regressions were
              adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors
              added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social
              isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured
              through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale,
              modified these associations. RESULTS: Among 6,986 participants
              (mean age = 62.1 $\pm$ 9.2 years), higher levels of social
              connections were associated with better global cognitive
              performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness
              was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34;
              -0.18). Interactions of depressive symptoms with social
              connections scores were found on memory z-score and with
              loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker
              association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition
              among those with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In a large
              sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were
              associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly,
              depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations.
              Future longitudinal studies are important to assess the direction
              of the association between social isolation and cognitive
              performance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur
              commonly in children and have been related to bullying
              victimization. However, whether bullying perpetration, peer
              rejection, or peer acceptance are related to hallucinatory
              experiences has remained under-examined. We used a novel peer
              nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying perpetration
              and (ii) social positions within peer networks were associated
              with future hallucinatory experiences. METHODS: This prospective
              study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study.
              Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer acceptance were
              assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N = 925). Using a
              social network analysis, we estimated social positions within
              peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization
              was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory
              experiences were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted
              for sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Higher levels of
              bullying perpetration were prospectively associated with an
              increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI

              fostering the acceptability and integration of new health
              services. Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing
              challenges in the development, implementation and evaluation of
              community pharmacy services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the
              foundation for building collaboration in the integrated delivery
              of health care. OBJECTIVES: This stakeholder analysis was
              performed to organize a collaborative initiative to develop a CPS
              aimed at preventing cardiovascular diseases in Andaluc{\'\i}a
              (Spain). It aimed to identify stakeholders,
              differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder
              relationships. METHOD: Stakeholders were identified using the
              snowballing technique. To differentiate/categorize stakeholders
              and analyze the relationships (i.e., collaboration) an online
              web-based questionnaire was sent to 186 stakeholders.
              Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest and
              attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3)
              capacity to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for
              involvement; (5) concerns; (6) whom they considered a key
              stakeholder; and (7) the level of collaboration they had with
              other stakeholders. Data analysis combined descriptive
              qualitative content analysis, descriptive quantitative analysis
              and social network analysis. RESULTS: Of the 186 stakeholders
              approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated. The identification process
              yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals, organizations or
              collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven stakeholders
              were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most
              participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were
              willing to collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public
              health and science were the main driving interests. A
              collaboration network existed between the 96 stakeholders.
              CONCLUSION: This study revealed the magnitude of the social
              system surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing
              cardiovascular disease. A large array of stakeholders was
              identified and analyzed, and a group of critical stakeholders
              selected. Stakeholder characteristics such as attitude toward the
              initiative, potential contribution, desire for involvement, and
              the existing collaboration network, provided complementary
              information that was helpful for planning the process and
              stakeholder engagement.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely around the world. Many
              mathematical models have been proposed to investigate the
              inflection point (IP) and the spread pattern of COVID-19.
              However, no researchers have applied social network analysis
              (SNA) to cluster their characteristics. We aimed to illustrate
              the use of SNA to identify the spread clusters of COVID-19.
              Cumulative numbers of infected cases (CNICs) in countries/regions
              were downloaded from GitHub. The CNIC patterns were extracted
              from SNA based on CNICs between countries/regions. The item
              response model (IRT) was applied to create a general predictive
              model for each country/region. The IP days were obtained from the
              IRT model. The location parameters in continents, China, and the
              United States were compared. The results showed that (1) three
              clusters (255},
  n = {51, 130, and 74 in patterns from Eastern Asia
              and Europe to America) were separated using SNA, (2) China had a
              shorter mean IP and smaller mean location parameter than other
              counterparts, and (3) an online dashboard was used to display the
              clusters along with IP days for each country/region.
              Spatiotemporal spread patterns can be clustered using SNA and
              correlation coefficients (CCs). A dashboard with spread clusters
              and IP days is recommended to epidemiologists and researchers and
              is not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

              {COVID-19} Pandemic in China},
  author = {Wei Lv and Wennan Zhou and Binli Gao and Yefan Han and Han Fang},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China,
              several social rumors in the form of false news, conspiracy
              theories, and magical cures had ever been shared and spread among
              the general public at an alarming rate, causing public panic and
              increasing the complexity and difficulty of social management.
              Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the
              driving factors of the social rumors during the COVID-19
              pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 1,537 rumors collected
              from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided the
              sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all
              kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation
              analysis were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics
              and the spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of the
              rumors, and the four stages of development were also divided
              according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key
              driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network
              analysis method was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode
              network characteristics, the generation driver-rumor 2-mode
              network characteristics, and the spreading driver-rumor 2-mode
              characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the
              number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as
              the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the
              importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social
              stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the
              four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating
              Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results
              of rumor drivers indicated that panic psychology and the lag in
              releasing government information played an essential role in
              driving the generation and spread of rumors. The public's low
              scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing
              rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors.
              CONCLUSION: The study revealed the mechanism of rumors. In
              addition, studies involving rumors on different emergencies and
              social platforms are warranted to enrich the findings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-wage dormitory-dwelling migrant workers in
              Singapore were disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease
              2019 (COVID-19) infection. This was attributed to communal living
              in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of
              inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the
              roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission.
              The study examined the networks of non-work-related activities
              among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit
              strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A
              population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers
              across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social
              ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related
              variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network
              questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented
              based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the
              structures and positions of networks between workers and visit
              areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure
              was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and
              visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the
              most frequently visited for essential services of grocery
              shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly
              for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the
              highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to
              COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Social and geospatial networks of migrant
              workers should be considered in the implementation of lockdown
              exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living
              conditions and monitoring systems. Essential services, like
              remittance and grocery shopping at affordable prices, need to be
              provided near to dormitories to minimize excess gatherings.},

  title = {Quantifying changes in the British cattle movement network},
  author = {Andrew J Duncan and Aaron Reeves and George J Gunn and Roger W Humphry},
  abstract = {The modelling of disease spread is crucial to the farming
              industry and policy makers. In some of these industries,
              excellent data exist on animal movements, along with the networks
              that these movements create, and allow researchers to model
              spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing
              System is an online recording system for cattle births, deaths
              and between-herd movements in the United Kingdom and is an
              excellent resource for any researchers interested in networks or
              modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system.
              Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know
              how much change is occurring in a network, to help judge the
              merit of using historical data within a modelling context. This
              article uses the data to construct weighted directed monthly
              movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and
              2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of
              the network has changed. Substantial changes in network structure
              may influence policy-makers directly or may influence models
              built upon the network data, and these in turn could impact
              policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13
              network metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as
              total number of nodes with movements and total movements, through
              to metrics to describe the network (e.g., Giant weakly and
              strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per node
              (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that
              there is a statistically significant effect of the period
              (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the values of nine of the 13 network
              metrics. For example median total degree decreased by 19\%. In
              addition to examining networks for two time periods, two updates
              of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement
              data stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates.
              Examination of these updates shows that there are small decreases
              in problem movements (such as animals leaving slaughterhouses)
              and therefore evidence of historical data being improved between
              updates. In combination with the significant effect of period on
              many of the network metrics, the modification of data between
              updates provides further evidence that the most recent available
              data should be used for network modelling. This will ensure that
              the most representative descriptions of the network are available
              to provide accurate modelling results to best inform policy
              makers.},

  abstract = {The development of peer relationships and of one's identity are
              key developmental proficiencies during adolescence. Understanding
              how immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents are developing a
              sense of their national identity and the role that this plays in
              how they select their friends and are influenced by their friends
              is essential for developing a more comprehensive understanding of
              adolescent development in context. The current study used
              longitudinal social network analysis to examine the interplay of
              national identity development and friendship network dynamics
              among immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents in Greece (N =
              1252; 46\% female). All youth with higher national identity
              resolution (i.e., youth's sense of clarity regarding their
              identity as a member of Greek society) in Grade 8 were more often
              nominated as a friend in Grade 9. During the transition from 8th
              to 9th grade, all youth became more similar to their nominated
              friends in terms of their Greek national identity exploration
              (i.e., degree to which they had engaged in activities to learn
              more about Greek society). During the transition from 7th to 8th
              grade, there was significant variability in peer selection on
              national identity exploration and resolution between immigrant
              and non-immigrant youth. Specifically, immigrant youth
              demonstrated selection effects consistent with notions of
              homophily, such that they were more likely to nominate peers in
              8th grade whose levels of national identity exploration and
              resolution were similar to their own when in 7th grade. In
              contrast, non-immigrant youth preferred peers in 8th grade with
              low levels of national identity exploration (regardless of their
              own levels of exploration in 7th grade) and peers whose levels of
              national identity resolution in 8th grade were different from
              their own in 7th grade (e.g., non-immigrant youth who reported
              high national identity resolution in 7th grade were more likely
              to nominate peers who had low national identity resolution in 8th
              grade). There were no differences by immigrant status in peer
              influence, suggesting that the significant peer influence effects
              that emerged during the transition from 8th to 9th grade in which
              youth became more similar to their friends in national identity
              exploration may reflect a universal process. These results chart
              new directions in understanding contemporary youth development in
              context by showing that adolescents develop their national
              identity and friendships in tandem and that certain aspects of
              this process may vary by immigrant status.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This review aimed to elucidate the significance of
              information collaboration in the prevention and control of public
              health emergencies, and its evolutionary pathway guided by the
              theory of complex adaptive systems. METHODS: The study employed
              time-slicing techniques and social network analysis to translate
              the dynamic evolution of information collaboration into a
              stage-based static representation. Data were collected from
              January to April 2020, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Python
              was used to amass data from diverse sources including government
              portals, public commentary, social organizations, market updates,
              and healthcare institutions. Post data collection, the
              structures, collaboration objectives, and participating entities
              within each time slice were explored using social network
              analysis. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the law of evolution
              for information collaboration in public health emergencies
              primarily starts with small-scale collaboration, grows to
              full-scale in the middle phase, and then reverts to small-scale
              in the final phase. The network's complexity increases initially
              and then gradually decreases, mirroring changes in collaboration
              tasks, objectives, and strategies. DISCUSSION: The dynamic
              pattern of information collaboration highlighted in this study
              offers valuable insights for enhancing emergency management
              capabilities. Recognizing the evolving nature of information

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has revealed under-reporting of
              personal network members (i.e., alters) in studies involving
              people who use drugs (PWUD). This analysis (1) characterizes
              relationships that were more likely to be omitted but later
              recalled with prompting and (2) identifies network structural
              characteristics most impacted by these omissions among a sample
              of PWUD in rural Appalachian Kentucky, an epicenter of the opioid
              epidemic. METHODS: Data were collected through longitudinal
              assessments as part of the Social Networks Among Appalachian
              People (SNAP) study (2008-2017). Study participants completed
              interviewer-administered questionnaires that collected social
              network data via free-listing at baseline and six-month
              intervals. At visit 5, after free-listing, interviewers prompted
              participants with the names of previously reported alters. We
              used modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating
              equations to identify individual- and relationship-level
              characteristics associated with an alter being reported only
              after prompting. We examined the impact of including vs.
              excluding relationships reported after prompting on local and
              global sociometric network measures (i.e., betweenness
              centrality, bridging, density, mean degree, transitivity,
              cliques, and 2-cores). RESULTS: Relationships reported only after
              prompting were more likely to be immediate family (Adjusted
              Prevalence Ratio [APR]:1.29; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI]:
              1.03-1.63) and less likely to involve sex (APR:0.54; 95\% CI:
              0.43-0.67). Considerable differences were observed for
              participant positional rankings of betweenness centrality and
              bridging, and differences in network density and average degree
              pre- and post-prompting were statistically significant.
              CONCLUSION: Longitudinal network studies that aim to assess
              transmission dynamics, information diffusion, or peer influence
              should consider the effects of omitted relationships.},

              fever (ASF) has been playing a deeply depressing role on swine
              value chain of Benin since its first occurrence in the country in
              1997. Exchanges between actors are fundamental among stakeholders

              organized with stakeholders to identify changes and other
              reactions that ensued from a recent ASF outbreak in Benin. In a
              second step, individual semi-structured interviews were

  author = {Veronica T Cole and Andrea M Hussong and Daniel M McNeish and Susan T Ennett and Andrew W Rothenberg and Nisha C Gottfredson and Robert W Faris},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The relationship between smoking and adolescents' peer
              relationships is complex, with studies showing increased risk of
              smoking for adolescents of both very high and very low social
              position. A key question is whether the impact of social position
              on smoking depends on an adolescent's level of coping motives
              (i.e., their desire to use smoking to mitigate negative affect).
              METHOD: We assessed how social position predicts nicotine
              dependence in a longitudinal sample (N = 3,717; 44.8\% male; mean
              age = 13.41 years) of adolescent lifetime smokers measured
              between 6th and 12th grades. Using both social network analysis
              and multilevel modeling, we assessed this question at the
              between-person and within-person level, hypothesizing that
              within-person decreases in social position would lead to
              increased risk of nicotine dependence among those with high
              levels of coping motives. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses,
              only interactions with the between-person measures of social
              position were found, with a slight negative relationship at low
              levels of coping motives. In addition, the main effect of coping
              motives was considerably stronger than that of social position at
              the between-person level, and social position had no significant
              within-person main effect on nicotine dependence risk.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adolescents with higher
              overall levels of social position among their peers may have
              slightly decreased risk for nicotine dependence, but only when
              coping motives are low. Counter to expectations, higher levels of
              nicotine dependence risk were not linked to fluctuations in
              social position.},

              risk-based surveillance},
  author = {Nicolas C Cardenas and Felipe Sanchez and Francisco P N Lopes and Gustavo Machado},
  abstract = {Most animal disease surveillance systems concentrate efforts in
              blocking transmission pathways and tracing back infected contacts
              while not considering the risk of transporting animals into areas
              with elevated disease risk. Here, we use a suite of spatial
              statistics and social network analysis to characterize animal
              movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease
              circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our
              model utilized equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks,
              between-farm horse movements, and spatial landscape data from
              2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and the movement of
              horses between farms with climate variables that foster
              conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a
              spatially explicit model that allows the effect of the climate
              variables on EIAV occurrence to vary through space (i.e.,
              non-stationary). Our results identified important areas in which
              in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections
              and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as
              having high 56 (11.3\%), medium 48 (9.66\%), and low 393 (79.1\%)
              spatial risk. The majority of the movements were between low-risk
              areas, altogether representing 68.68\% of all animal movements.
              Meanwhile, 9.48\% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20\% were
              within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37\% of the animals entering
              low-risk areas came from high-risk areas. On the other hand,
              4.91\% of the animals in the high-risk areas came from low- and
              medium-risk areas. Our results demonstrate that animal movements
              and spatial risk mapping could be used to make informed decisions
              before issuing animal movement permits, thus potentially reducing
              the chances of reintroducing infection into areas of low risk.},

              improve the collective response to transgender (trans) persons
              who have been sexually assaulted (the trans-LINK Network). A
              validated social network analysis survey was sent to 119 member

              indicated that the pandemic had affected their ability to

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social network analysis can elucidate tuberculosis
              transmission dynamics outside the home and may inform novel
              network-based case-finding strategies. METHODS: We assessed the
              association between social network characteristics and prevalent
              tuberculosis infection among residents (aged $\geq$15 years) of 9
              rural communities in Eastern Uganda. Social contacts named during
              a census were used to create community-specific nonhousehold
              social networks. We evaluated whether social network structure
              and characteristics of first-degree contacts (sex, human
              immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, tuberculosis infection) were
              associated with revalent tuberculosis infection (positive
              tuberculin skin test [TST] result) after adjusting for
              individual-level risk factors (age, sex, HIV status, tuberculosis
              contact, wealth, occupation, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin
              [BCG] vaccination) with targeted maximum likelihood estimation.
              RESULTS: Among 3 335 residents sampled for TST, 32\% had a
              positive TST results and 4\% reported a tuberculosis contact. The
              social network contained 15 328 first-degree contacts. Persons
              with the most network centrality (top 10\%) (adjusted risk ratio,
              1.3 [95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.1]) and the most (top 10\%)
              male contacts (1.5 [1.3-1.9]) had a higher risk of prevalent
              tuberculosis, than those in the remaining 90\%. People with
              $\geq$1 contact with HIV (adjusted risk ratio, 1.3 [95\%
              confidence interval, 1.1-1.6]) and $\geq$2 contacts with
              tuberculosis infection were more likely to have tuberculosis
              themselves (2.6 [ 95\% confidence interval: 2.2-2.9]).
              CONCLUSIONS: Social networks with higher centrality, more men,
              contacts with HIV, and tuberculosis infection were positively
              associated with tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis transmission
              within measurable social networks may explain prevalent
              tuberculosis not associated with a household contact. Further

              is warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time where social
              media allows increased conversations about it. These
              conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines
              against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop
              communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer
              accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public
              health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of
              public institutions on Twitter campaign \#yomevacuno to deal with
              misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS: This
              paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of
              Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8(th) to
              23(rd), 2020. Tweets included content \#yomevacuno hashtag.
              RESULTS: A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82\% were

              traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de
              Sanidad from Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48\% of a

              threatened the state's governance and public safety. This study
              investigates whether and how public participation can affect
              central government policy response to this pandemic in the
              context of China. METHODS: This study constructs the theoretical
              framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network
              Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New
              Media, and the central government response in this pandemic.
              RESULTS: Findings show that the Chinese central government does
              not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk
              management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up
              governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this
              process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced
              with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the
              central government, public participation firstly creates
              ``participation'' with the authority of the media, forms public
              opinion, and then the prompt policy response from the central
              government. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the central
              government will refer to public participation to decide the
              policy response. It also shows that the theory of government
              response applies to both the local government and the central

              response plans, played a significant role in all 3 networks. KCDC
              also was involved in all 3 networks, but was most prominent in
              the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared only in the patient
              management network. Each health authority coordinated and
              collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the
              networks, but unclear lines of responsibilities also were found.
              CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the roles and
              responsibilities of health authorities at the national level were
              fragmented and lacked clarity. Public health emergency
              preparedness must consider carefully the way to establish
              collaborative response systems.},

              in North West London: a comparison of patient and healthcare
              workers' perceptions},
  author = {David Sunkersing and Finbarr C Martin and Paul Sullivan and Derek Bell},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that successful assessment and care
              for frail individuals requires integrated and collaborative care
              and support across and within settings. Understanding the care
              and support networks of a frail individual could therefore prove
              useful in understanding need and designing support. This study
              explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling
              older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of
              likely frailty, by describing and comparing the individuals'
              networks as perceived by themselves and as perceived by
              healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A
              convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare
              professionals were recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls
              Group' programme within North-West London. Individual (i.e., one
              on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted to establish an
              individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social
              network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural
              characteristics of the networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic
              analysis aided data interpretation. RESULTS: All reported care
              and support networks showed a high contribution level from family
              and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported
              networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the
              'frequency' and 'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare
              professional reported networks, the reported frequency of
              interaction as detailed in patient records was used to ascertain
              'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the
              importance of the role of informal carers and friends along with
              healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with
              frailty. There was congruence in the makeup of 'patient' and
              'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of
              helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight
              the multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which
              could be targeted by healthcare professionals to support the care
              of frail individuals.},

              through human and animal movement, contact with veterinary
              medical supplies, equipment, or instruments. We used a

              study used for key player determination (or key node

              Intervention to Prevent Early Childhood Obesity},
  author = {Ariella R Korn and Ross A Hammond and Erin Hennessy and Aviva Must and Mark C Pachucki and Christina D Economos},
  abstract = {Background: Community coalitions often lead and coordinate
              ``whole-of-community'' childhood obesity prevention
              interventions. A growing body of work suggests that coalition
              network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and
              advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This
              study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition
              networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We
              administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot
              whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017).
              Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their
              nominated discussion partners (``first-degree alters'') related
              to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter
              respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties'
              interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were
              assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and
              exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included
              558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations,
              parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size
              and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network
              (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest
              proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently
              (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak
              intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected
              (1\%-3\% of possible ties observed) and most and least
              centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time,
              ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within
              community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving
              membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources,
              ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention
              messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have
              supported more equal participation and control over intervention
              efforts. Future research should assess generalizability of
              network patterns, network influences on implementation processes,
              and possible network interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine how comorbidities were associated
              with outcomes (illness severity or death) among hospitalized
              patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Data
              were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea Disease
              Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical
              and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with
              COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in
              Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic
              regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with
              COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was
              the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen
              treatment not needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or
              death. RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the
              fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio
              [OR], 2.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and
              chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95\% CI,
              1.35 to 7.52) were significantly associated with disease
              severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95\% CI, 2.00 to 14.31), heart failure
              (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95\% CI, 1.22 to 8.15), malignancy (OR, 3.38;
              95\% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95\% CI, 1.45 to

              were associated with an increased risk of death. Asthma and
              hypertension showed statistically insignificant associations with
              an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases
              contribute differently to the severity of COVID-19. To
              efficiently allocate limited medical resources, underlying
              comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly CKD,
              COPD, and HF.},

              {COVID-19} in China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis
              Study},
  author = {Dandan Wang and Yuxing Qian},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social
              media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during
              public health crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of
              rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the
              structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well
              as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This
              study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor
              rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect
              on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on
              Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the
              COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the
              information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS:
              We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl
              rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January
              23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis,
              sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical
              analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was
              an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes
              when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested
              the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and
              the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the
              results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive
              judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from
              three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and
              sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber
              effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting
              mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and
              the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our
              results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber
              effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to
              like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained
              significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and
              sharing, and incivility. We found that online users'
              information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and
              information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative
              sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an
              echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic,
              interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on
              interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several
              suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to
              achieve better rumor rebuttal.},

              importance in an adolescent's development. Levels of
              self-efficacy can contribute to the decision-making process of
              the adolescent. In this phase, a group of friends becomes
              increasingly important. Alcohol is present in different social
              aspects. Adolescents use alcohol as a social facilitator or as
              part of the development of their autonomy. The purpose of this
              study is to describe and analyze the structure of the friendship
              network, self-efficacy, and alcohol consumption in adolescents.
              METHODS: We used an online platform with validated self-reported
              questionnaires to collect the data. The sample consisted of 195
              adolescents aged between 16 and 18, from different educational
              centers in Bierzo (Spain). RESULTS: It was found that 43.6\% of
              the adolescents in our research were high-risk consumers.
              Significant differences were obtained in terms of self-efficacy
              and different network metrics. These networks were represented by
              considering the levels of alcohol consumption. In the friendship
              network, we observed how the central adolescents presented higher
              levels of self-efficacy and lower alcohol consumption.
              CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy is established as a predictor of
              coping and not consuming alcohol and adolescence as a crucial
              moment to implement prevention strategies. Social Network

              a governance measure to slow down the spread of the epidemic and

              uncertainty and life-cycle characteristics of public health
              emergencies, emergency information release represents the process
              of time dynamics. At present, it is an inevitable trend to
              establish a collaborative mechanism for emergency information

              conducted research based on social network analysis. Based on
              information from COVID-19-related press conferences held by
              China's central government, the emergency information release
              collaborative networks (EIRCNs), and Emergency
              Organizations-Emergency Information Release Matters (EOs-EIRMs)
              2-mode network were constructed. With the time evolution, the
              tightness, convergence, stability, and connectivity of EIRCNs in
              public health emergencies presented the process of lowering and
              then raising. At different stages, the core emergency
              organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs continued to maintain a certain
              degree of activity. Their dynamic processes showed the
              characteristics of diversification rather than homogeneity. The
              time evolution of emergency information release matters (EIRMs)
              reflected the dynamic adjustment of the government's prevention
              and control measures and responded to the diversification of the
              public's understanding and protection needs during different
              stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further examined the
              driving factors and implementation mechanism of the time
              evolution characteristics of the collaborative mode of emergency
              information release. The implementation of EIRMs at different
              stages had different resource requirements, which were usually

              practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed
              typologies of information exchange networks in primary care
              practices. RESULTS: We included 153 health workers from 40
              practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social
              network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures
              were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected
              networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with
              medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy
              and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low
              hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17
              for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions,
              information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team
              members. Information exchange outside the family practice took
              place mainly with nurses and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              identified four types of information exchange structures, which
              provides a practical tool for management and improvement in
              primary care. Some practices had few information transfer
              connections and could hardly be considered a network. TRIAL

              predict the role of pig trade in the spread of pathogens and
              generate essential patterns that can be used to understand,
              prevent, and mitigate possible outbreaks. This study aimed to
              describe the network between premises such as production herds,
              slaughterhouses, and traders of pig movements and identify
              heterogeneities in the connectivity of premises in the state of
              Santa Catarina, Brazil, using social network analysis (SNA). We
              used static and temporal network approaches to describe pig trade
              in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA
              parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of
              node-loyalty, resilience of outgoing contact chains, and
              communities. Two indexes were implemented, the first one is a
              normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures and other
              index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd
              population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized
              by a municipality to target and rank surveillance activities.
              Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in
              that 80 \% of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus
              acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were
              found. The results also showed that premises were highly
              connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low
              levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 \% of the
              paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which
              accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the
              use of time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate
              potential transmission pathways and outbreak sizes. Compared to
              static networks, the application of temporal network approaches
              was more suitable to capture the dynamics of pig trade and should
              be used to inform the design of riskbased disease surveillance.},

              from developing countries is limited. This study aimed to
              identify patient-sharing networks among physicians in China and
              explore the effect of attributes of physician networks on
              healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis
              was undertaken based on healthcare claims from Urban Employee
              Basic Medical Insurance Data spanning the years 2015 to 2018. We
              identified patients with hypertension and modeled physician
              patient-sharing networks using social network analysis.
              Relationships among physicians were further quantified using
              network measures. We fitted a log-linear model to examine the
              association between networks and healthcare at the physician
              level. RESULTS: 29,321 patients, seen by 3,429 physicians from 57
              hospitals in one eastern city of China were included. Physicians
              were connected to 21 other physicians (threshold = 1 shared
              patients) or 7 other physicians (threshold = 4, 6, or 8 shared
              patients). Degree and centrality measures of physicians at
              primary care facilities were significantly lower than those at
              secondary or tertiary hospitals (p < 0.001). The links between
              physicians at different hospital grades were weak and patients
              tended to flow among physicians at the same hospital grade.
              Compared with a low closeness centrality, a medium level was
              associated with fewer hospitalization costs and days, and high
              closeness centrality was accompanied by a sharper decrease (all P
              < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians were located in
              peripheral positions in China, and the links between primary care
              facilities and higher-grade hospitals were still weak.
              Characteristics of physicians' networks and the position of
              physicians in the network were associated with spending and
              utilization of services, but not all associations were in the

              The Inter-Ministerial National Structural Intervention Trial is a
              trial to test the impact on HIV rates of a structural
              intervention that refocuses government structural support
              programs in favor of young women. Ensuring that the intervention
              reaches all vulnerable young women in any given community is a
              challenge. Door-to-door recruitment was inefficient in previous
              work, so we explored innovative ways to reach this population. We
              sought to understand the support networks of marginalized young
              women, and to test the possibility of using social networks to
              support universal recruitment in this population. Ego-centric and
              sociometric analyses were used to describe the support networks
              of marginalized young women. Marginalized young women go to other
              women and relatives for support, and they communicate face to
              face rather than using social media. Network maps show how young
              women were connected to each other. Lessons from the pilot
              include a better understanding of how to use social networks as a
              recruitment method, such as the time required and the types of
              community members that can help. Social networks could help reach

              social network analysis methods, this paper summarized
              characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Shaanxi, China, and
              analyzed these patients' dynamic contact network structure. The
              study found that there are many clustered infections through
              strong ties, about one-third of cases are caused by relatives'
              infection. In early stages of the epidemic, imported cases were
              the most, and in the later stages, local infection cases were the
              most. The infected people were mostly middle-aged men. Symptoms
              of imported cases occurred on average of 3 days after they
              arrived, and medical measures were taken 5 days later on average.
              All cases showed symptoms in less than 2 days on average and were
              then taken to medical treatment. The contact network can be
              divided into multiple disconnected components. The largest
              component has 12 patients. The average degree centrality in the
              network is 0.987, average betweenness degree is 0, average

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increased awareness of infection control
              precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
              still spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing
              a substantial burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to
              define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health
              care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate
              health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak
              periods. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using
              secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized
              cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by
              age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases
              and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms,
              roommates, and health care providers over time. RESULTS: Matched
              controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay,
              mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care
              providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates
              increased in the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of
              the network at one campus identified potential source patients
              linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected
              to those same rooms proliferated. CONCLUSIONS: Only the network
              animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA
              through the network, rather than attributes measured in the
              traditional case control study.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students
              have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational
              context. Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based
              on relationships. However, there is a lack of studies that
              analyse the behaviour of university students based on their
              social structure in the context of a pandemic. This information
              could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective
              responses to adversities. The Social Network Analysis (SNA)
              method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.
              The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour
              of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic
              with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive
              cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public
              University, Le{\'o}n, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November
              2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of
              residence. The data were collected from a database created
              specifically at the university to ``track'' contacts in the
              COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. We applied the SNA for the analysis
              of the data. The leadership on the university residence was
              measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed
              using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.
              Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels
              of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection. The
              results were statistically significant between the centrality in
              the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most
              leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three
              students had the key player structure in the network. Networking
              behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be
              related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be
              described on the basis of aspects of similarities between
              students, and even leaders connecting the cohabitation
              sub-networks. In this context, Social Network Analysis could be
              considered as a methodological approach for future network
              studies in health emergency contexts.},

              of physician network-level position among peers and the
              acceptance of opioid-related promotional payments using national
              publicly available datasets from 2015. Design National

              SUBJECTS: Physicians who shared Medicare patients with at least
              two other physicians in 2015. MAIN MEASURES: Modified Poisson's
              regressions are used to estimate the adjusted incidence rate
              ratio (aIRR) for social network position (i.e., degree,
              betweenness, and transitivity) and number of peers with payments
              as a function of individual receipt of opioid-related promotional

              more payments, and those who have \$100 or more in payments. KEY
              RESULTS: Physicians with opioid-related payments were
              significantly more likely to have at least one peer with an
              opioid-related payment (IRR: 2.5, 95\% CI: 2.3-2.8), but had
              fewer shared patients (i.e., top quartile compared to the first

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) account for some of
              the most explosive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
              hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics globally. While individual
              drivers of infection are well understood, less is known about
              network factors, with minimal data beyond direct ties. METHODS:
              2512 PWID in New Delhi, India were recruited in 2017-19 using a
              sociometric network design. Sampling was initiated with 10
              indexes who recruited named injection partners (people who they
              injected with in the prior month). Each recruit then recruited
              their named injection partners following the same process with
              cross-network linkages established by biometric data.
              Participants responded to a survey, including information on
              injection venues, and provided a blood sample. Factors associated
              with HIV/HCV infection were identified using logistic regression.
              RESULTS: The median age was 26; 99\% were male. Baseline HIV
              prevalence was 37.0\% and 46.8\% were actively infected with HCV
              (HCV RNA positive). The odds of prevalent HIV and active HCV
              infection decreased with each additional degree of separation
              from an infected alter (HIV AOR: 0.87; HCV AOR: 0.90) and
              increased among those who injected at a specific venue (HIV AOR:
              1.50; HCV AOR: 1.69) independent of individual-level factors
              (p<0.001). In addition, sociometric factors, for example, network
              distance to an infected alter, were statistically significant
              predictors even when considering immediate egocentric ties.
              CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an extremely high burden of
              HIV and HCV infection and a highly interconnected injection and
              spatial network structure. Incorporating network and spatial data
              into the design/implementation of interventions may help
              interrupt transmission while improving efficiency. FUNDING:

              from China's massive open online course platform called
              icourse.163 and performed social network analysis on 15 courses
              to explore courses' interaction characteristics before, during,
              and after the COVID-19 pan-demic. Specifically, we focused on the
              following aspects: (1) variations in the scale of online learning
              amid COVID-19; (2a) the characteristics of online learning
              interaction during the pandemic; (2b) the characteristics of

              differences in the interaction characteristics of social science

              small number of courses witnessed an uptick in online
              interaction, suggesting that the pandemic's role in promoting the
              scale of courses was not significant. During the pandemic, online
              learning interaction became more frequent among course network
              members whose interaction scale increased. After the pandemic,
              although the scale of interaction declined, online learning
              interaction became more effective. The scale and level of
              interaction in Electrodynamics (a natural science course) and
              Economics (a social science course) both rose during the
              pan-demic. However, long after the pandemic, the Economics course
              sustained online interaction whereas interaction in the
              Electrodynamics course steadily declined. This discrepancy could
              be due to the unique characteristics of natural science courses

  title = {The impact factors of social media users' forwarding behavior of
              {COVID-19} vaccine topic: Based on empirical analysis of Chinese
              Weibo users},
  author = {Kun Sun and Han Wang and Jinsheng Zhang},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Social media, an essential source of public access
              to information regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, has a significant
              effect on the transmission of information regarding the COVID-19
              vaccines and helps the public gain correct insights into the
              effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. The forwarding
              behavior of social media users on posts concerned with COVID-19
              vaccine topics can rapidly disseminate vaccine information in a
              short period, which has a significant effect on transmission and
              helps the public access relevant information. However, the
              factors of social media users' forwarding posts are still
              uncertain thus far. In this paper, we investigated the factors of
              the forwarding COVID-19 vaccines Weibo posts on Chinese social
              media and verified the correlation between social network
              characteristics, Weibo textual sentiment characteristics, and
              post forwarding. METHODS: This paper used data mining, machine
              learning, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and
              regression analysis. Using `` (COVID-19 vaccine)'' as the
              keyword, we used data mining to crawl 121,834 Weibo posts on Sina
              Weibo from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2021. Weibo posts not closely
              correlated with the topic of the COVID-19 vaccines were filtered
              out using machine learning. In the end, 3,158 posts were used for
              data analysis. The proportions of positive sentiment and negative
              sentiment in the textual of Weibo posts were calculated through
              sentiment analysis. On that basis, the sentiment characteristics
              of Weibo posts were determined. The social network
              characteristics of information transmission on the COVID-19
              vaccine topic were determined through social network analysis.
              The correlation between social network characteristics, sentiment
              characteristics of the text, and the forwarding volume of posts
              was verified through regression analysis. RESULTS: The results
              suggest that there was a significant positive correlation between
              the degree of posting users in the social network structure and
              the amount of forwarding. The relationship between the closeness
              centrality and the forwarding volume was significantly positive.
              The betweenness centrality was significantly positively
              correlated with the forwarding volume. There was no significant
              relationship between the number of posts containing more positive
              sentiments and the forwarding volume of posts. There was a
              significant positive correlation between the number of Weibo
              posts containing more negative sentiments and the forwarding
              volume. CONCLUSION: According to the characteristics of users,
              COVID-19 vaccine posts from opinion leaders, ``gatekeepers,'' and
              users with high-closeness centrality are more likely to be
              reposted. Users with these characteristics should be valued for
              their important role in disseminating information about COVID-19
              vaccines. In addition, the sentiment contained in the Weibo post
              is an important factor influencing the public to forward vaccine
              posts. Special attention should be paid to the negative
              sentimental tendency contained in this post on Weibo to mitigate
              the negative impact of the information epidemic and improve the
              transmission effect of COVID-19 vaccine information.},

              we explore the structure of air pollution transmission networks

              periods from 6 January 2015 to 3 June 2017, this paper used
              social network analysis (SNA) to construct a spatial association
              network of air pollution in the region, and analyzed the spatial
              association of air pollution among cities and its causes in an
              attempt to reveal the transmission path of air pollution in the
              region. The results show that inter-city air pollution in

              with obvious seasonal differences of ``high in winter and low in
              summer''. Different cities in the region play the roles of
              ``spillover'', ``intermediary'' and ``receiver'' of air pollution
              in the network. Small respirable particulate (PM2.5) pollution
              constitutes a significant component of air pollution in northeast

              prevention and control measures should be adopted to combat the
              air pollution problem, and different treatment measures should be
              developed for different city ``roles'' in the pollution network,

  author = {Minwoong Chung and Debra Dekker and Chelsea Gridley-Smith and James W Dearing},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Communication networks among professionals can be
              pathways for accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some
              local health departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge.
              Such a network could prove valuable during public health
              emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the
              United States were tied together in an informal network to share
              information and advice about innovative community health
              practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and
              February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD
              leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice.
              We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices
              informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based
              practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We
              used a social network analysis program to assess answers.
              RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network
              appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were
              repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples
              (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold
              these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners).
              Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed
              performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and
              boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase
              the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption
              of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new
              public health practices, programs, or policies may find our
              results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.},

              cycle (HET4) of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) is a
              social network strategy implemented in jurisdictions. The main
              objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate the utility of the
              NHBS HET cycle data for network analysis; 2) to apply statistical
              analysis in support of previous HIV research, as well as to
              develop new research results focused on demographic variables and
              prevention/intervention with respect to heterosexual HIV risk;
              and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with respect to the
              EHE plan. METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A
              total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free
              social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network
              visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We
              additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine
              the association of selected variables with HIV status in three
              models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2)
              behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects.
              RESULTS: The results showed 3\% were tested positive. Seed 1
              initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives);
              seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2
              positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes
              across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people
              high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI\% 5.699,
              115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens
              ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model
              higher association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness
              among those tested negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV
              intervention in the past 12 months with those tested positive
              ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: The network visualization
              was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the
              success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network
              strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest
              behavioral supplements for DC's HIV planning activities. As part
              of the evaluation process our analysis helps to understand the
              impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on
              peoples' HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions
              use network visualizations to evaluate the efficacy in reaching
              hidden populations.},

              diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment and
              self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were
              obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core
              users in the negative emotional contagion network. In the

              directed one-mode network was constructed using the data from the
              electronic animal health certificate platform in 2017. The nodes
              were designed as districts in Hunan and edges as flows of pig
              movement between districts. Social network analysis was used to
              analyse network characteristics and generalized linear models
              were performed to ascertain the socioeconomic factors that affect
              the pig movement network. During 2017, the pig movement network
              within the Hunan Province was composed of 122 nodes and 8562
              directed connections, with a total of 510,973 shipments and
              17,815,040 pigs moved. The network displayed a small-world
              topology, which had a higher clustering coefficient (0.4 vs. 0.1)
              and shorter average shortest path length (1.8 vs. 3.7) compared
              with equivalent random networks. The degree centrality positively
              correlated with closeness centrality (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) as
              well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). After
              restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the
              top 10 \% of degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by
              nearly 50 \% in the network, whereas the number of pigs was
              reduced by 94.0 \% when movement restrictions were implemented in
              areas with the top 50 \% of degree centrality. Observed network
              metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking
              in November and December. Generalized linear models showed that
              the size of the human population and per capita gross domestic
              product were the most important socioeconomic drivers of pig
              movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a
              small-world network in which the introduction and spread of
              diseases may be quicker. More human, material, and financial
              resources should be allocated to areas with higher centrality.
              Swine movements were seasonal, and the inspection and quarantine
              work should be reinforced in the fourth quarter, especially in
              November and December. Pig movements were more active in areas
              with larger populations and advanced economy, and stricter
              supervision in these areas should be implemented. Our findings
              contribute to understanding the movement of pigs and the
              associated influencing factors in a big pig producing province in
              China, and the supervision strategies proposed in this study can
              be extended to other regions in China if proved to be viable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical
              diseases targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease
              elimination requires collaboration between stakeholders, country
              ownership and the involvement of community-level stakeholders.
              The state of stakeholder relationship determines the ease and
              timeliness of meeting disease elimination targets. Mapping
              stakeholder relationships is critical for assessing gaps in the
              schistosomiasis control program implementation, and providing a
              roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study aimed to
              measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and
              resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo
              state, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a Network
              Representative design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The
              study was conducted within Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local
              Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North (urban) and Akinyele
              (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a link-tracing
              approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from
              stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare,
              academia, and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed
              using Gephi software for network cohesion across the three
              networks. RESULTS: The social network analysis revealed high
              clustering and low density across the three networks implying low
              cohesion across multiple stakeholder categories. The contact and
              collaborative networks were the most active with the lowest level
              of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network. Stakeholders
              were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and
              stakeholders within the organized governance and public health
              system were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control
              program. CONCLUSION: The low cohesion, high clustering and low
              network density among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis
              control program should be addressed in other to drive innovation
              and meet the WHO schistosomiasis elimination target.},

              distinguishes pro- and anti-vaccine activists from moderates that

              that the number of tweeting accounts grows in each category
              during controversial periods. We also find that accounts

              Ethiopia},
  author = {Getnet Abie Mekonnen and Gobena Ameni and James L N Wood and {ETHICOBOTS consortium} and Stefan Berg and Andrew J K Conlan},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy cattle movement could be a major risk factor
              for the spread of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in emerging dairy
              belts of Ethiopia. Dairy cattle may be moved between farms over
              long distances, and hence understanding the route and frequency
              of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread
              of BTB between farms, which could ultimately help to inform
              policy makers to design cost effective control strategies. The
              objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the
              network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on
              the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas
              among the Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa,
              Gondar and Mekelle. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted
              in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern of dairy cattle
              movement for the last 5 years (September 2013 to August 2018).
              Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the
              relationship between the network patterns and the prevalence of
              BTB in these regions were made using social network analysis.
              RESULTS: The cattle movement network structure display both scale
              free and small world properties implying local clustering with
              fewer farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection,
              with the potential to act as super spreaders of BTB if infected.
              Farms having a history of cattle movements onto the herds were
              more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) compared to farms not
              having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and the
              batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with
              prevalence of BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more
              outgoing cattle showed a decrease on the likelihood of BTB
              infection (OR = 0.57) compared to farms which maintained their
              cattle. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the patterns of cattle
              movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to
              the potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk
              of transmission potential could be efficiently targeted by
              control measures aimed at reducing the spread of BTB. The network
              structure described can also provide the starting point to build
              and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other
              infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and
              cultural sector, challenged by classical swine fever (CSF).
              Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated
              its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig
              identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement
              control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according
              to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction
              strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network.
              Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected,
              recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis
              were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million
              pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of
              144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and
              51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean
              highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10
              most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per
              week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average
              CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced
              the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction
              it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets
              and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the
              best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available,
              highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance
              in the network. When comparing the static network with its
              temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \%
              overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also
              traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately
              233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be
              more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in
              particular, taking into account the temporal information would
              make the risk assessment much more precise. This information
              could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing
              the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.},

  abstract = {This study used social network analysis to investigate the
              indirect contact network between counties through the movement of
              live pigs through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong
              Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June
              2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig
              trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the
              movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties
              was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was
              developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored,
              and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for
              each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts
              of different disease control strategies on the potential
              magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The
              results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the
              four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More
              batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries)
              were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016
              (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside
              Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi,
              Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties
              (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the
              two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located
              10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes'
              degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network
              property, and the network in January had a higher clustering
              coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length
              (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of
              the network were in the central, northern and western regions of
              Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from
              the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree
              or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of
              a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to
              inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through
              this live pig market trade network in south China.},

              disastrous accidents, public health accidents, natural disasters,
              and social security accidents are the main types of night tourism

              governments-together with nongovernmental organizations-play a
              crucial role in crisis management systems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose
              of this paper is to corroborate the characteristics government
              ministries and domestic and foreign institutions exhibit through
              their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a
              disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
              METHODS: Using the social network analysis technique, the span of
              the COVID-19 pandemic was segmented into 3 time frames, and the
              relational characteristics of the COVID-19 contagious disease
              response department and related agencies at home and abroad were
              analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the
              second and third time frames indicates that the agents reacting
              to contagious diseases do not necessarily hold the central
              position in the network. From this, it can be inferred that it is
              not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the key
              to a successful response to various disasters also lies in
              cooperation with the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The
              incongruency between the findings of this paper and the existing
              disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that both
              the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate
              for a coordinated crisis response in disaster situations.
              Furthermore, much significance lies in the fact that this paper
              explores the various aspects that could surface among the host
              and relevant parties in a real-life pandemic.},

  title = {Peer influence of injection drug use cessation among dyads in
              rural eastern Kentucky},
  author = {Abby E Rudolph and Elizabeth Upton and Madelyn J McDonald and April M Young and Jennifer R Havens},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This analysis aims to assess whether injection drug
              use cessation among peers predicts injection drug use cessation
              among individuals and explores whether this association varies by
              relationship type and strength. METHODS: Data were collected
              through baseline and 6-month assessments for the Social Networks
              among Appalachian People study (2008-2011).
              Interviewer-administered surveys collected sociodemographic and
              drug use behaviors (past 6 months and lifetime). Participants
              also listed sex, drug use, and social support partners (past 6
              months). Listed names were cross-referenced with survey
              participants to identify relationships between study
              participants. The analytic sample was further restricted to
              include only those relationship pairs where both individuals
              reported a history of injection drug use at baseline (n = 244
              unique individuals and 746 dyads). We fit a generalized
              estimating equations logistic regression model to (1) assess the
              relationship between peer injection cessation and individual
              injection cessation and (2) determine whether the strength of
              this association differs by relationship-level variables (i.e.,
              relationship role, relationship type, relationship duration,
              frequency of interaction, residential proximity). RESULTS:
              Overall, those with a network member who ceased injection drug
              use were more likely to stop injecting over the following 6-month
              period (AOR=1.65). The magnitude of this association was greater
              for social support partners (AOR=2.95), family members
              (AOR=3.56), those with whom the participant interacted at least
              daily (AOR=2.17), and those who the participant knew longer
              (AOR=2.09). Further, among family members, the effect size was
              greater when relationships were further restricted to immediate
              family members (AOR=5.35). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that
              in this rural community, closer, more supportive relationships,
              may be more influential for modeling injection cessation;
              however, relationship-types were not mutually exclusive so
              differences in effect size across strata may not be statistically
              significant. In this setting, social support through the recovery
              process (including cessation attempts with peers) may increase
              likelihood of injection cessation.},

  author = {Namje Kim and Su Jin Kang and Sangwoo Tak},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We reconstructed a coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) outbreak to examine how a large cluster at a church
              setting spread before being detected and estimate the potential
              effectiveness of complying with mask-wearing guidelines
              recommended by the government. METHODS: A mathematical model with
              a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a
              COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model
              was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang
              Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated
              baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of
              complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations
              estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the
              outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI],
              937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed
              data. The counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing
              estimated an average of 45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a
              standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the
              church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the
              outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA
              is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of
              COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are
              based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary
              implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still
              relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are
              unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to
              develop precise measures and guidelines for particular
              organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster
              outbreaks.},

              smoking according to socioeconomic status and tobacco control
              context: a systematic review},
  author = {H J Littlecott and G F Moore and M McCann and G J Melendez-Torres and L Mercken and H Reed and M Mann and F Dobbie and J Hawkins},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whilst prevalence of youth smoking in middle and high
              income countries has decreased, inequality has prevailed. The
              introduction of legislation regulating tobacco use in public
              spaces varies across countries, impacting the tobacco control
              context. Thus reviewing our knowledge of how social networks may
              influence smoking differently within different contexts is
              required to facilitate the development of context-specific
              interventions. METHODS: The search, conducted on 31st May 2019,
              included the following smoking-related terms; schools,
              adolescents, peers and social networks. Inclusion and exclusion
              criteria were applied throughout the title and abstract screening
              and full text screening. Quality assessment and synthesis
              followed. Studies were narratively synthesised to identify
              changes according to legislative context. This synthesis was
              conducted separately for findings relating to three categories:
              socioeconomic status; social selection and influence; and network
              position. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. Differences in
              the relationship between network characteristics and smoking
              according to socioeconomic status were measured in five out of
              fifteen studies in Europe. Results varied across studies, with
              differences in network characteristics and their association with
              smoking varying both between schools of a differing and those of
              a similar socioeconomic composition. For studies conducted both
              before and after the introduction of comprehensive smoking
              legislation, the evidence for selection processes was more
              consistent than influence, which varied according to reciprocity.
              Findings showed that isolates were more likely to smoke and
              in-degree and out-degree centrality were related to smoking both
              before and after the introduction of legislation. The
              relationship between popularity and smoking was contingent on
              school level smoking prevalence in studies conducted before the
              introduction of legislation, but not after. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              effects according to socioeconomic status were underreported in
              the included studies and no consistent evidence of change after
              the introduction of a comprehensive smoking ban was observed.
              Further network analyses are required using more recent data to
              obtain a comprehensive understanding of how network processes may
              influence smoking differently according to socioeconomic status,
              and how adaptation could be used to enhance intervention
              effectiveness. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: International

              adolescents in the study, its relationship to being overweight
              (overweight+obese) and to analyse the structure of the social
              network of friendship established in adolescents doing group
              sports, using different parameters indicative of centrality.
              SETTING: It was carried out in an educational environment, in 11
              classrooms belonging to 5 Schools in Ponferrada (Spain).
              PARTICIPANTS: 235 adolescents were included in the study (49.4\%
              female), who were classified as normal weight or overweight.
              PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical Activity
              Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used to study the level
              of physical activity. A social network analysis was carried out
              to analyse structural variables of centrality in different
              degrees of contact. RESULTS: 30.2\% of the participants in our
              study were overweight. Relative to female participants in this
              study, males obtained significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A
              (OR: 2.11; 95\% CI: 1.04 to 4.25; p value: 0.036) and were more
              likely to participate in group sport (OR: 4.59; 95\% CI: 2.28 to
              9.22; p value: 0.000). We found no significant relationship
              between physical activity and the weight status in the total
              sample, but among female participants, those with overweight
              status had higher odds of reporting high levels of physical
              exercise (OR: 4.50; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In
              terms of centrality, differentiating by gender, women who
              participated in group sports were more likely to be classified as
              having low values of centrality, while the opposite effect
              occurred for men, more likely to be classified as having high
              values of centrality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, with
              limitations, underline the importance of two fundamental aspects
              to be taken into account in the design of future strategies:
              gender and the centrality within the social network depending on
              the intensity of contact they have with their peers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Care fragmentation is associated with higher rates of
              infection after durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
              implant. Less is known about the relationship between care
              fragmentation and total spending, and whether this relationship
              is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured
              from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network
              theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on
              the number of shared patients among providers (ie,
              anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care
              specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring
              for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation
              between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured
              using average path length, which describes how efficiently
              information flows among network members; longer path length
              indicates greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of
              care fragmentation and multivariable regression were used to
              analyze the relationship between care fragmentation and LVAD
              payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of
              post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81\%
              male, 73\% white, 11\% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of
              63.1 years (11.1). The mean (SD) level of care fragmentation in
              provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) payment from
              admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872).
              Mean (SD) total payments at the lower, middle, and upper terciles
              of care fragmentation were $250,135 ($111,924), $243,288
              ($109,376), and $247,290 ($108,241), respectively. In mediation
              analysis, the indirect effect of care fragmentation on total
              payments, through infections, was positive and statistically
              significant ($\beta$=16032.5},
  p = {0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Greater care
              fragmentation in the delivery of care surrounding durable LVAD
              implantation is associated with a higher incidence of infections,
              and consequently, higher payments for Medicare beneficiaries.
              Interventions to reduce care fragmentation may reduce the
              incidence of infections and in turn enhance the value of care for
              patients undergoing durable LVAD implantation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018
              over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over
              40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on
              social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This
              study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known
              to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the
              information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.
              METHODS: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted
              anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting
              vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available
              content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social
              network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The
              final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's $\kappa$ ranged
              0.71-1.0 after double-coding. RESULTS: The majority (89\%) of
              individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who
              divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were
              represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics,
              modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as
              ``trust,'' ``alternatives,'' ``safety,'' and ``conspiracy.'' For
              example, a comment representative of ``conspiracy'' is that
              poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical
              symptoms of polio. An example from the ``alternatives'' sub-group
              is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper
              qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that
              these individuals also tended to post material against other
              health-related practices such as water fluoridation and
              circumcision. CONCLUSIONS: Social media outlets may facilitate
              anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the
              diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments
              against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within
              sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health
              professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more
              effective, targeted messages to different constituencies.},

              university students living in the same hall of residence. Social
              network analysis has been applied for data analysis. Factions and
              Girvan-Newman algorithms have been applied to detect the existing
              cohesive subgroups. The UCINET tool was used for the calculation
              of the SNA measure. A visualization of the global network will be
              carried out using Gephi software. After applying the
              Girvan-Newman and Factions, in both cases it was found that the
              best division into subgroups was the one that divided the network
              into 4 subgroups. There is high degree of cohesion within the
              subgroups and a low cohesion between them. The relationship
              between subgroup membership and gender was significant. The
              degree of COVID-19 infection is related to the degree of
              clustering between the students. College students form subgroups
              in their residence. Social network analysis facilitates an
              understanding of structural behavior during the pandemic. The
              study provides evidence on the importance of gender, race and the
              building where they live in creating network structures that
              favor, or not, contagion during a pandemic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Universities are vulnerable to infectious disease
              outbreaks, making them ideal environments to study transmission
              dynamics and evaluate mitigation and surveillance measures. Here,
              we analyze multimodal COVID-19-associated data collected during
              the 2020-2021 academic year at Colorado Mesa University and
              introduce a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and response framework.
              METHODS: We analyzed epidemiological and sociobehavioral data
              (demographics, contact tracing, and WiFi-based co-location data)
              alongside pathogen surveillance data (wastewater and diagnostic
              testing, and viral genomic sequencing of wastewater and clinical
              specimens) to characterize outbreak dynamics and inform policy.
              We applied relative risk, multiple linear regression, and social
              network assortativity to identify attributes or behaviors
              associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2. To characterize
              SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we used viral sequencing, phylogenomic
              tools, and functional assays. FINDINGS: Athletes, particularly
              those on high-contact teams, had the highest risk of testing
              positive. On average, individuals who tested positive had more
              contacts and longer interaction durations than individuals who
              never tested positive. The distribution of contacts per
              individual was overdispersed, although not as overdispersed as
              the distribution of phylogenomic descendants. Corroboration via
              technical replicates was essential for identification of
              wastewater mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we
              formulate a framework that combines tools into an integrated
              disease surveillance program that can be implemented in other
              congregate settings with limited resources. FUNDING: This work

              highlight the importance of understanding the behavioral ecology
              of disease outbreaks at human-wildlife interfaces. Specifically,
              the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife
              interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in
              urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social
              network analysis and epidemiological
              Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate
              zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint
              propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social
              grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.)
              in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data
              using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the
              same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social
              interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic
              exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to
              structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species,
              and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social
              (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to
              the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host
              species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through
              macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their
              grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques.
              Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in
              these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in
              anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their
              aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more
              vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social
              structure. The global features of these networks that influence
              disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological
              covariates, need further investigation. Animals that consistently
              interact with both humans and their conspecifics are important
              targets for disease control.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 vaccine distribution route directly impacts the
              community's mortality and infection rate. Therefore, optimal
              vaccination dissemination would appreciably lower the death and
              infection rates. This paper proposes the Epidemic Vulnerability
              Index (EVI) that quantitatively evaluates the subject's potential
              risk. Our primary aim for the suggested index is to diminish both
              infection rate and death rate efficiently. EVI was accordingly
              designed with clinical factors determining the mortality and
              social factors incorporating the infection rate. Through
              statistical COVID-19 patient dataset analysis and social network
              analysis with an agent-based model that is analogous to a
              real-world system, we define and experimentally validate the
              capability of EVI. Our experiments consist of nine vaccination
              distribution scenarios, including existing indexes which estimate
              the risk and stochastically proliferate the contagion and vaccine
              in a 300,000 agent-based graph network. We compared the outcome
              and variation of the three metrics in the experiments: infection
              case, death case, and death rate. Through this assessment,
              vaccination by the descending order of EVI has shown to have a
              significant outcome with an average of 5.0\% lower infection

              high risk of COVID-19 infection. However, despite the
              introduction of risk-lowering practices in the hospital setting,
              there have been many cases of SARS-COV-2 infection among Health
              Care Workers. Fast and efficient contact tracing and Sars-CoV-2
              PCR-based testing of the close contacts of Health Care Workers
              with confirmed infections are essential steps to limit nosocomial
              outbreaks. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at
              Bari Policlinico General University-Hospital (Apulia, Italy) and
              describes the management of a cluster of SARS-COV-2 infections in
              three Operative Units. The contact tracing activities and the
              measures implemented to control the outbreak are described.
              RESULTS: Among the 186 Health Care Workers active in the cluster
              setting, there were 9 (4.8\%) confirmed cases, including the
              index case. Due to the outbreak, three Operative Units were
              closed to limit virus circulation. Health Care Workers with
              confirmed infections tested negative after a mean of 28.0$\pm$6.6

  abstract = {Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an
              important role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors.
              Methodological advances permit simultaneous modeling of these
              contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few
              empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do
              typically: examine each context separately; include contexts for
              the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data; or do
              not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an
              eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of
              socio-contextual contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol
              use. The primary parameters of interest are therefore variance
              rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed
              effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how
              each context may matter differently for male and female
              adolescents.Method: Data come from the National Longitudinal
              Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 females},
  n = {8,102
              males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and
              cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and
              sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups,
              schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%,
              respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use.
              Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups
              and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative
              to neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females.
              These findings have both methodological and practical
              implications. Multilevel modeling can model contexts
              simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth
              alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention
              strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a
              serious public health threat and spread rapidly between
              healthcare facilities (HCFs) during interfacility patient
              movement. We examined patterns of transmission of CRE associated
              with network clustering and positions during patient
              interfacility transfer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was
              conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social
              network analysis was performed by constructing
              facility-to-facility patient transfer network using CRE
              surveillance data. The network method (community detection
              algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns of CRE in the
              network. In addition, network measures of centrality and local
              connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each
              healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression
              analysis was applied to test the association between network
              measures and facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. RESULTS: A
              network of 268 healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10
              acute-care hospitals (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of
              identified CRE cases. Transmission of New Delhi
              metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters,
              yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care
              abroad. The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold
              (adjusted rate ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
              3.02-6.72) higher than that of long-term care facilities. Each
              additional patient shared with another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\%
              CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence rate of CRE at that HCF.
              CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of CRE at a given HCF was
              predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased
              surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are

  author = {D{\a'e}bora Lou{\a'\i}se Sim{\~o}es Gouv{\^e}a and Giovanni Marcos Lovisi and Marcia Gomide da Silva Mello},
  abstract = {In 2015 the correlation between increasing numbers of cases of
              microcephaly and a zika virus outbreak led to recognition of an
              epidemic of congenital zika virus syndrome (CZVS), highlighting
              well-known weaknesses in health care measures. This article
              examines the network of virtual information available on health
              service provision for children suffering from CZVS in Rio de
              Janeiro. Using social media analysis, data on information about
              services and care institutions were collected from virtual
              sources using the Google search engine, so as to assess relations
              among these actors in 2018. The results revealed a fragmented
              network centred on virtual sources and secondary and tertiary
              public care services, with striking proximity of press sources to
              public services. Also salient was the isolation of private
              services and the lack of dialogue between philanthropic and
              public services. Moreover, the information offered was found to
              be insufficient and superficial, despite the gaps in the formal
              rehabilitation network. The evidence thus suggested the
              importance of a well-established health care service network and
              the necessity of fostering communication through virtual media.},

  title = {Outbreak minimization v.s. influence maximization: an
              optimization framework},
  author = {Chun-Hung Cheng and Yong-Hong Kuo and Ziye Zhou},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An effective approach to containing epidemic
              outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19) is targeted immunization, which
              involves identifying ``super spreaders'' who play a key role in
              spreading disease over human contact networks. The ultimate goal
              of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is
              to minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with
              the famous influence maximization problem studied in the field of
              social network analysis, whose objective is to identify a group
              of influential individuals to maximize the influence spread over
              social networks. This study aims to establish the equivalence of
              the two problems and develop an effective methodology for
              targeted immunization through the use of influence maximization.
              METHODS: We present a concise formulation of the targeted
              immunization problem and show its equivalence to the influence
              maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold
              diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well
              as the targeted immunization problem, can be solved by an
              optimization approach. A Benders' decomposition algorithm is
              developed to solve the optimization problem for effective
              solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is
              conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the
              optimization approach on real-world large-scale networks.
              Computational results show that our proposed approaches achieve
              more effective solutions compared to existing methods.
              CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization
              and influence maximization problems and present a concise
              formulation for the influence maximization problem under the
              Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff between
              computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is
              illustrated. Our results suggest that the capability of
              determining the optimal group of individuals for immunization is
              particularly crucial for the containment of infectious disease
              outbreaks within a small network. Finally, our proposed
              methodology not only determines the optimal solutions for target
              immunization, but can also aid policymakers in determining the
              right level of immunization coverage.},

  abstract = {After spreading in the Americas, West Nile virus was detected in
              Guadeloupe (French West Indies) for the first time in 2002. Ever
              since, several organizations have conducted research, serological
              surveys, and surveillance activities to detect the virus in
              horses, birds, mosquitoes, and humans. Organizations often
              carried them out independently, leading to knowledge gaps within
              the current virus' situation. Nearly 20 years after the first
              evidence of West Nile virus in the archipelago, it has not yet
              been isolated, its impact on human and animal populations is
              unknown, and its local epidemiological cycle is still poorly
              understood. Within the framework of a pilot project started in
              Guadeloupe in 2019, West Nile virus was chosen as a federative
              model to apply the ``One Health'' approach for zoonotic
              epidemiological surveillance and shift from a sectorial to an
              integrated surveillance system. Human, animal, and environmental
              health actors involved in both research and surveillance were
              considered. Semi-directed interviews and a Social Network
              Analysis were carried out to learn about the surveillance network
              structure and actors, analyze information flows, and identify
              communication challenges. An information system was developed to
              fill major gaps: users' needs and main functionalities were
              defined through a participatory process where actors also tested
              and validated the tool. Additionally, all actors shared their
              data, which were digitized, cataloged, and centralized, to be
              analyzed later. An R Shiny server was integrated into the
              information system, allowing an accessible and dynamic display of
              data showcasing all of the partners' information. Finally, a
              series of virtual workshops were organized among actors to
              discuss preliminary results and plan the next steps to improve
              West Nile Virus and vector-borne or emerging zoonosis
              surveillance. The actors are willing to build a more resilient
              and cooperative network in Guadeloupe with improved relevance,
              efficiency, and effectiveness of their work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) have
              the highest risk of HIV of any group in the U.S. Prevalence could
              be even higher among Black and Latino MSM belonging to the House
              Ball Community (HBC), an understudied community comprised
              primarily of Black and Latino sexual and gender minorities, with
              HIV prevalence from non-probability samples ranging from 4\% to
              38\%. OBJECTIVES: Basic Psychological Needs Theory will be
              utilized to understand how sexual health communication (SHC)
              influences sexual health behaviors of HBC-MSM. The proposed study
              will advance this goal by describing characteristics of SHC
              embedded within social and sexual networks, and identifying the
              effects of SHC on sexual health behaviors among a sample of Black
              and Latino HBC-MSM. METHODS: This study entails cross-sectional
              quantitative survey design with internet-based data collection to
              test a theory-driven model of the effects of autonomy supportive
              communication on sexual health behaviors. Respondent-driven
              sampling (RDS) and internet driven sampling (ID) will be used to
              recruit a sample of 200 HBC-MSM. We will utilize egocentric
              network analysis to describe (a) the HBC-specific social and/or
              sexual network members who provide SHC; (b) the degree of
              autonomy support provided by network members, and (c) the sexual
              health behaviors characterizing the sample of HBC-MSM. Structural
              equation modeling (SEM) will be performed to test associations
              between autonomy supportive sexual health communication
              (independent variable) and sexual health behaviors (outcome),
              with needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation as intervening
              mediators. DISCUSSION: Such knowledge is necessary to expand
              understanding of how SHC impacts sexual health behaviors for
              HBC-MSM. The study provides an critical perspective on sexual
              health behaviors and motivations as participants operate in HBC.
              Knowledge generated from this study will help improve current HIV
              prevention interventions, as well as inform the development of
              future interventions, tailored to HBC-MSM.},

              surveillance},
  author = {V Simbizi and R Moerane and G Ramsay and C Mubamba and C Abolnik and B Gummow},
  abstract = {Despite the benefits of rural chickens in the Eastern Cape
              Province (ECP) of South Africa, this sector is still
              underdeveloped and poorly surveyed for poultry diseases. The lack
              of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled with
              communities and practices where the interactions between birds
              are high, emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken
              diseases in the province. However, to set up such a system
              requires knowledge of the value chain and trade networks.
              Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value
              chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading
              practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification
              of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted.
              Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the
              province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be
              targeted for disease surveillance based on their centrality
              within the network and their size and influence within their ego
              networks. Traders and their transport vehicles were identified as
              biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease
              surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified
              three municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD)
              and Enoch Mgijima as trade hubs where interaction between rural
              chickens occurs and resources can be focused. The movement of
              spent hens from commercial operations that are transported over
              long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships
              were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the
              first study to formally describe chicken trade networks within
              the province and the surrounding region. Its findings provide a
              model for cost effective targeted surveillance in the ECP and
              similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also
              provides insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a
              possible contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation
              once the barriers to market entry are lifted.},

              Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with
              cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to
              Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers
              collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities
              and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the
              SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The
              entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative
              and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then
              visualized these domains with social network analysis. RESULTS:
              Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives.
              Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts
              of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and
              management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other
              than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past
              trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and
              seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social
              capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate
              access to formal health and social system supports.
              INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has illustrated the
              entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among
              vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the
              exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers
              to mitigation. Cultural brokering and community social capital
              are key supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals' social networks exert a strong influence
              on alcohol use, but valid assessment of network drinking behavior
              is typically lengthy and high in participant burden. The aim of
              this study was to validate the Brief Alcohol Social Density
              Assessment (BASDA), an efficient measure of perceived alcohol use
              within a person's social network, in a sample of adult drinkers
              from the general community. Specifically, the convergent,
              criterion-related, incremental validity and internal validity
              were investigated by examining the BASDA in relation to other
              established measures of drinking motives, weekly drinking level,
              and severity of involvement. METHODS: Participants were 903 (56\%
              female) adults who reported drinking in the last year and who
              completed the BASDA, the Drinking Motives Questionnaire, the
              Daily Drinking Questionnaire, and the Alcohol Use Disorders
              Identification Test (AUDIT). RESULTS: Significant positive
              correlations were found between the BASDA and drinking motives,
              drinking quantity, and the AUDIT (rs = 0.21 to 0.51, ps < 0.001),
              providing support for convergent validity. There was a
              significantly higher BASDA score for those scoring at or above an
              AUDIT cutoff for hazardous drinking (p < 0.001), providing
              support for criterion-related validity. Finally, beyond motives
              and covariates, the BASDA was significantly associated with total
              AUDIT score ($\Delta$R(2) = 0.09, p < 0.001), indicating its
              additive contribution and providing support for incremental
              validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed excellent fit,
              and all items significantly loaded onto a single factor (p <
              0.0001), providing evidence of internal validity. The resulting
              alcohol social density latent variable was significantly and
              robustly associated with drinks per week and AUDIT total score.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support for the BASDA
              as a valid and efficient measure of social network alcohol
              density for understanding social influences on alcohol misuse.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, problematic
              Internet use (PIU) has become a serious issue among residential
              college students, who remain physically isolated from off-campus
              society. This study constructs an integrated model to investigate
              the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and
              objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n
              = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese
              university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to
              measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed
              via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using
              Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis
              and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors'
              effects on PIU. RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence rate of
              PIU was 30.6\%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor
              for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer
              environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree
              performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network
              conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low
              prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a
              risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective
              efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more
              than one PIU friend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further
              intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal
              LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally,
              interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may

              depressive symptoms are influenced by social networks in a
              stressful context, especially focusing on the processes of social
              selection and social influence. The current study aimed to
              explore the coevolution of sociometric popularity and depressive
              symptoms among adolescents suffering from the stress attached to
              the Chinese gaokao. METHODS: The analytical sample comprised 1062
              Chinese adolescents who were under significant pressure to return
              to school for an additional year (returnees) to prepare for
              college entrance examinations. Students were assessed for
              depressive symptoms and asked to nominate up to five friends
              within their classes across four waves (six months). We employed
              stochastic actor-oriented models to investigate the
              interdependent relationships between popularity and depressive
              symptoms. RESULTS: Adolescents' depressive symptoms negatively
              predicted future friendship popularity in this stressful
              situation, but not vice versa. The results of this study also
              highlighted the importance of friends' popularity, indicating
              that adolescents who nominated popular peers as friends tended to
              subsequently have lower depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These
              findings suggested that friends' popularity may serve as a
              protective factor against depressive symptoms under major chronic
              stress. Network-based interventions may have practical
              implications for reducing depressive symptoms under major chronic
              stress.},

              {COVID-19} infection among healthcare staff in Wuhan, China},
  author = {Y Wang and W Wu and Z Cheng and X Tan and Z Yang and X Zeng and B Mei and Z Ni and X Wang},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, there have been many cases of coronavirus
              disease 2019 (COVID-19) among medical staff; however, the main
              factors associated with the infection are not well understood.
              AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in
              medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
              conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in
              which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the
              care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
              Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and
              uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network
              analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links
              between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical
              staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor
              identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask
              or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25;
              betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and
              mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group.
              This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest
              influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality:
              0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the
              uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected
              group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64).
              For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood
              Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two
              isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the
              main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting
              COVID-19 infection. The main factor contributing to COVID-19
              infections among medical staff was touching the cheek, nose, and
              mouth while working.},

              rapid spread of COVID-19-related news around the world. Within

              levels by using social network analysis based on data from the

              the current technology accumulation in this field in China, and
              provide patent information support for the scientific efforts to
              fight against COVID-19. The findings are as follows: First, the
              inter-regional cooperation level in China's COVID-19 patent
              cooperation network shows a decreasing trend from eastern to
              central to western regions. At the inter-applicant cooperation
              level, kinship-based cooperation is the strongest, business-based
              cooperation has the widest scope, while proximity-based
              cooperation exists throughout these two main models of
              cooperation. Second, coastal provinces and cities occupy a core
              position in the network, and play an important role in utilizing
              structural holes and bridging. Patent applicants with high
              centrality are mostly firms. Research institutes and universities
              mainly play the role of bridges. Third and lastly, there is no

  author = {Sung-Ha Lee and Hyeok-Hee Lee and Kiho Sung and Yoosik Youm and Hyeon Chang Kim},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The adverse health effects of individual-level social
              isolation (e.g., perceived loneliness) have been well documented
              in older adults. However, little is known about the impact of
              collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought
              to examine the association of group-level segregation with
              cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults. METHODS: From the
              prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
              database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who
              were aged $\geq$60 years or were married to those aged $\geq$60
              years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups
              separate from the major social group were defined as
              group-level-segregated. The CVH score was calculated as the
              number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from
              the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal
              logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and
              longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and
              CVH. RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years;
              60.0\% female), 108 (20.5\%) were segregated at baseline. In the
              crosssectional analysis, group-level segregation was
              significantly associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH
              score at baseline after adjusting for socio-demographic factors
              and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.95). Among 274 participants who
              completed an 8-year follow-up, group-level segregation at
              baseline was marginally associated with lower odds of having a
              higher CVH score at 8 years (OR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.24 to 1.02).
              CONCLUSIONS: Group-level segregation was associated with worse
              CVH. These findings imply that the social network structure of a
              community may influence its members' health status.},

              pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial
              farm density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a
              scale-free topology but was very sparse, suggesting a moderate

              and contact between people, which is closely related to the
              network of interpersonal relationships. Based on the
              epidemiological investigations of 1218 COVID-19 cases in eight
              areas of China, we use text analysis, social network analysis and
              visualization methods to construct a dynamic contact network of
              the epidemic. We analyze the corresponding demographic
              characteristics, network indicators, and structural
              characteristics of this network. We found that more than 65\% of
              cases are likely to be infected by a strong relationship, and
              nearly 40\% of cases have family members infected at the same
              time. The overall connectivity of the contact network is low, but
              there are still some clustered infections. In terms of the degree
              distribution, most cases' degrees are concentrated between 0 and
              2, which is relatively low, and only a few ones have a higher
              degree value. The degree distribution also conforms to the power
              law distribution, indicating the network is a scale-free network.
              There are 17 cases with a degree greater than 10, and these
              cluster infections are usually caused by local transmission. The
              first implication of this research is we find that the COVID-19

              computational sociological methods for infectious disease
              studies; the second implication is to confirm that text analysis

              actionability and success of that plan, both scientific and
              implementation elements must be taken into account. The aim of
              this study is to assess the 'Zero Childhood Cancer Personalised
              Medicine Program' (the Zero Program), an Australian first-ever
              and most comprehensive personalised medicine programme for
              children with high-risk or relapsed cancer, in terms of its
              structure, process and implementational effect. METHODS AND
              ANALYSIS: We will assess Program delivery mechanisms. The
              development of the implementation and evaluation strategy will
              concentrate on the work of the Zero Program as a complex whole.
              This includes the structure of collaborative links across
              stakeholder groups involved in Program development and delivery,
              changes to collaborative relationships over time and the impact
              of group working on Program outcomes. We are applying a
              mixed-methods design including: a rapid ethnography (observations
              of stakeholder interactions and informal conversations), Program
              professionals' completion of a rapid health implementation
              proforma and a social network analysis. Formative evaluations of
              the implementation science effects, applying feedback techniques,
              for example, Formative Evaluation Feedback Loops and the Zero
              Program professionals' feedback, will determine where Program
              tailoring may be needed. A repeat of the social network analysis
              downstream will examine network changes over time, followed by an
              expert panel using the expert recommendations for implementing
              change to assess the integration of implementation strategies
              into the Program structure. A summative evaluation of the Program
              will bring the research elements together, leading to
              comprehensive data triangulation and determining the
              sustainability and implementational effects of Program delivery.
              ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has
              been granted by Hunter New England Research Ethics Committee, New
              South Wales, Australia (approval ref: 2019/ETH12025). Knowledge

              Non-cancer Chronic Users of Opioid Analgesics: a Social Network
              Analysis},
  author = {Keiki Hinami and Michael J Ray and Kruti Doshi and Maria Torres and Steven Aks and John J Shannon and William E Trick},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continued rise in fatalities from opioid
              analgesics despite a steady decline in the number of individual
              prescriptions directing $\geq$ 90 morphine milligram equivalents
              (MME)/day may be explained by patient exposures to redundant
              prescriptions from multiple prescribers. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated
              prescribers' specialty and social network characteristics
              associated with high-risk opioid exposures resulting from
              single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or
              multi-prescriber discoordination. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
              study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of prescribers with opioid
              analgesic prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users
              in an Illinois Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016. MAIN
              MEASURES: Per prescriber rates of single-prescriber
              high-daily-dose prescriptions or multi-prescriber
              discoordination. KEY RESULTS: For 2280 beneficiaries, 36,798
              opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers.
              Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers
              and 7\% of beneficiaries) that directed $\geq$ 90 MME/day,
              discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk
              exposures-13\% of prescriptions (involving 23\% of prescribers
              and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at
              highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal
              medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence interval)
              5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and
              surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis
              identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of
              high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected
              groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency
              medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the
              sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for
              high-risk exposures. CONCLUSION: Low-volume prescribers in the
              social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or
              discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume
              prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among
              low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should
              be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration
              of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to
              specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are
              potential policy implications.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the spatial pattern of urban biomedicine
              innovation networks by separately using four scales, i.e., the
              national scale, interregional scale, urban agglomeration scale,
              and provincial scale, on the basis of Chinese biomedicine patent
              data from the incoPat global patent database (GPD) (2001-2020)
              and using the method of social network analysis (SNA). Through
              the research, it is found that (1) on the national scale, the
              Chinese biomedicine innovation network becomes denser from west
              to the east as its complexity continuously increases. Its spatial
              structure takes the form of a radial network pattern with Beijing
              and Shanghai as its centers. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had an
              obvious negative impact on this network at present. (2) On the
              interregional scale, the strength of interregional network ties
              is greater than that of intraregional network ties. The eastern,
              central and western biomedicine innovation networks appear to be
              heterogeneous networks with regional central cities as the cores.
              (3) At the urban agglomeration scale, the strength of
              intraurban-agglomeration network ties is greater than that of
              interurban-agglomeration network ties. The three major urban
              agglomerations have formed radial spatial patterns with central
              cities as the hubs. (4) At the provincial scale, the
              intraprovincial networks have poor connectivity and low internal
              ties strength, which manifest as core-periphery structures with
              the provincial capitals as centers. Our research conclusion helps
              to clarify the current accumulation of technology and offer
              guidance for the development of China's biomedicine industry.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected China's
              macroeconomy, industrial transformation, and high-quality
              development. Research on economic patterns and urban network
              systems can provide a reference for healthy development of the
              regional economic system. The evolution of the economic pattern
              and urban network system of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay
              Area (GBA) from 2010 to 2020 is investigated using methods (e.g.,
              the gravity center model, the gravitational force model, social
              network analysis, and geographic information system). (1) The
              gravity center of gross domestic product (GDP) of the GBA is
              located in Nansha district, Guangzhou, with a skewing direction
              northwest-east-northwest and a movement rate of
              ``large-small-large.'' The center of import and export and the
              center of consumption show a ``zigzagging migration'' in which
              the center of investment shows an ``irregular (random)
              migration''. (2) The economic connection degree of cities in the
              GBA exhibits a high ascending velocity, and the whole area tends
              to be mature, with a significant effect of spatial proximity.
              With the steady increase in network density, there is significant
              polarization of network centrality in the region. The four major
              cohesive subgroups have been relatively stable and consistent
              with the degree of geographic proximity of the cities. The
              center-periphery structure is more significant, in which the core
              area is extended to the cities on the east coast of the Pearl
              River Estuary, thus forming the core cluster of ``Hong
              Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Dongguan.'' In this study, the evolution
              of economic patterns and urban network systems in the GBA over
              the past decade is analyzed using multiple methods (i.e., gravity
              model, urban network system analysis, and geographic information
              system) based on urban socioeconomic data by starting from
              various spatial elements (e.g., ``points, lines, and networks'')
              to gain insights into and optimize research on regional economic
              development after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

              farms in France and their association with the 2016-2017 epidemic
              of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza ({H5N8})},
  author = {B Bauzile and G Sicard and C Guinat and M Andraud and N Rose and P Hammami and B Durand and M C Paul and T Vergne},
  abstract = {Live animal movements generate direct contacts (via the exchange
              of live animals) and indirect contacts (via the transit of
              transport vehicles) between farms, which can contribute to the
              spread of pathogens. However, most analyses focus solely on
              direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution
              of live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases.
              Here, we used French live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one
              of the largest transport companies to compare direct and indirect
              contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate how these
              patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of
              highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614
              farms were included in the study, and two directed networks were
              generated: the animal introduction network (exchange of live
              ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles).
              Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were
              scrutinized in relation to farm infection status during the
              epidemic. Results showed that farms were substantially more
              connected in the transit network than in the animal introduction
              network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more
              opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals.
              We also showed that animal introduction and transit networks'
              statistics decreased substantially during the epidemic
              (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods
              (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a
              probability of 33.3 \% that a farm exposed to the infection
              through either of the two live duck movement networks (i.e. that
              was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was reported
              as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within
              seven days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that
              the level of exposure of farms by these two contact patterns was
              low, leading only to a handful of transmission events through
              these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live animal
              movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but
              have been efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the
              French 2020-2021 epidemic. These results underpin the relevance
              of studying indirect contacts resulting from the movement of
              animals to understand their transmission potential and the
              importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease
              control strategies.},

              students from 5 different educational centres participate in this
              study between March and December 2015. Data analysis carried out
              is divided into two blocks: social network analysis and
              unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social
              network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find
              the best number of cohesive groups within each of the friendship
              networks of the different classes analysed. RESULTS: After
              applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the best division
              into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom
              B and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences
              between the groups and the gender and diet variables. After
              applying K-means using population diet as an input variable, a
              K-means clustering of 2 clusters for class A, 3 clusters for
              class B and 3 clusters for class C is obtained. CONCLUSION:
              Adolescents form subgroups within their classrooms. Subgroup
              cohesion is defined by the fact that nodes share similarities in
              aspects that influence obesity, they share attributes related to
              food quality and gender. The concept of homophily, related to
              SNA, justifies our results. Artificial intelligence techniques
              together with the application of the Girvan-Newman provide
              robustness to the structural analysis of similarities and
              cohesion between subgroups.},

              and qualitative data were analysed through iterative and

              showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the

              themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study sought to better understand the types of
              locations that serve as hubs for the transmission of COVID-19.
              METHODS: Contact tracers interviewed individuals who tested
              positive for SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 and March 2021, as
              well as the people with whom those individuals had contact. We
              conducted a 2-mode social network analysis of people by the types
              of places they visited, focusing on the forms of centrality
              exhibited by place types. RESULTS: The most exposed locations
              were grocery stores, commercial stores, restaurants, commercial
              services, and schools. These types of locations also have the
              highest ``betweenness,'' meaning that they tend to serve as hubs
              between other kinds of locations since people would usually visit
              more than 1 location in a day or when infected. The highest pairs
              of locations were grocery store/retail store, restaurant/retail
              store, and restaurant/grocery store. Schools are not at the top
              but are 3 times in the top 7 pairs of locations and connected to
              the 3 types of locations in those top pairs. CONCLUSIONS: As the
              pandemic progressed, location hotspots shifted between
              businesses, schools, and homes. In this social network analysis,
              certain types of locations appeared to be potential hubs of
              transmission.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore causal attributions among
              Korean breast cancer patients who were planning to undergo
              adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) as well as the relationships
              between patient demographic and clinical characteristics and
              their causal attributions. Causal attributions were assessed with
              an open-ended response item, which asked patients to list what
              they thought were the three most important causal factors of
              their illness. The relationships between patient characteristics
              and causal attributions were determined through univariate
              analysis, and the relationships between causal attributions were
              obtained using social network analysis. A total of 299
              participants provided 707 responses. Stress, diet, and exercise
              were believed to be the three most likely causes of breast
              cancer. There were no significant differences between causal
              attributions and the age, education level, marital status, or
              cancer stage of patients. However, there were differences in the
              associations between personality, genetics, and reproductive
              history and patient-identified causal attributions according to
              the patients' family history of cancer. Patients with a family
              history of cancer were more likely to believe that personality
              and genetics/family history were causes of breast cancer compared
              to patients without such a history. Therefore, it is necessary to
              educate patients to perceive stress and lifestyle-related factors
              as modifiable causal factors in order to have a positive effect

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) have been significant among elderly residents of
              residential aged-care services (RACS). To prevent incursions of
              COVID-19 in RACS in Australia, visitors were banned and aged-care
              workers were encouraged to work at a single site. We conducted a
              review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand
              how workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe
              acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS.
              DESIGN: Retrospective outbreak review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:
              Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria,
              Australia, May-October 2020. METHODS: The Victorian Department of
              Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct
              2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through
              workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through
              households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the
              number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of
              outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission
              via households. RESULTS: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak
              as staff, 91 (4.5\%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three
              outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed
              potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In
              addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak
              through their household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were
              attributed to staff-household transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting
              worker mobility through single-site policies could reduce the
              chances of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from one RACS to another.
              However, initiatives that reduce the chance of transmission via
              household networks would also be needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent Zika virus (ZIKAV) epidemics disclosed a
              major public health threat and a scientific and technological
              (S\&T) challenge. The lessons learned from the S\&T response of
              Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to
              inform further research and guide scientific investments. The
              present study aimed to assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and
              disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health
              challenges. METHODS: Scientometric and social network analysis
              methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and
              potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017.
              ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of
              Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published
              articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library
              Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin
              America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were
              retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation.
              Records from each database were individually downloaded,
              integrated, standardized and analyzed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5421
              ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015
              onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and
              Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the
              global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families
              backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were
              filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest
              contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations
              of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also
              the main focus of patents. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis offered a
              comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and
              showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and
              disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries
              have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical
              manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was
              potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in
              the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC
              country filing patents, mostly represented by independent
              inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for
              a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries
              ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.},

              Proliferation of {COVID-19} in Korea?},
  author = {Yun Jo and Andy Hong and Hyungun Sung},
  abstract = {COVID-19 has sparked a debate on the vulnerability of densely
              populated cities. Some studies argue that high-density urban
              centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a
              higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other
              studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population
              density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19.
              While several studies have examined the role of urban density and
              connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been
              conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the
              role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing
              different measures of urban density and connectivity during the
              first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of
              density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of
              connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the
              Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database.
              We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of
              confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county
              level, collected individually from regional government websites
              in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an
              important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in
              Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure,
              particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better
              indicator of COVID-19 proliferation than the density measures.
              Our findings imply that policies that take into account different
              types of connectivity between cities might be necessary to
              contain the outbreak in the early phase.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: As sex between men is a major route of human
              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in most western countries,
              restrictive deferral rules for blood donation have largely been
              implemented regarding men having sex with men (MSM). Here, we
              sought here to assign unreported HIV risk factors in blood donors
              (BDs) and reevaluated the MSM-associated fraction of HIV
              transfusion residual risk (\%RR(MSM) ). METHODS: We applied a
              genetic distance-based approach to infer an HIV transmission
              network for 384 HIV sequences from French BDs and 1337 HIV
              sequences from individuals with known risk factors (ANRS PRIMO
              primary HIV infection cohort). We validated the possibility of
              assigning a risk factor according to clustering using assortative
              mixing. Finally, we recalculated the \%RR(MSM) . RESULTS: A total
              of 81 of 284 (28.5\%) male and 5 of 100 (5\%) female BDs belonged
              to a cluster; 72 (88.9\%) of the 81 male BDs belonged to MSM
              clusters. After cluster correction, 8 of 67 (11.9\%), 4 of 21
              (19.0\%), and 19 of 88 (21.6\%) HIV-positive (HIV+) male BDs with
              heterosexual, other, or unknown risk factors could be
              reclassified as MSM, accounting for 10.9\% of the total HIV+ male
              BDs. Overall, 139 of 284 HIV+ male donors (48.9\%) could be
              considered MSM between 2000 and 2016 in France. Between 2005 and
              2016, the \%RR(MSM) increase varied from 0 to 19\%, without
              differing significantly from the \%RR(MSM) before
              reclassification. CONCLUSION: Network inference can be used to
              complement declaration data on risk factors for HIV infection in
              BDs. This approach, complementary to behavioral studies, is a
              valuable tool to evaluate the effect of changes in deferral

              Survey data were collected in Chicago, Illinois, USA, between
              2018 and 2019 from Black SGM. A total of 371 participants

              completed an egocentric network inventory assessing perceptions
              of their social network members' (alters') injunctive and

              of drugs to enhance sex (i.e., injunctive norms) and alters'
              engagement in these behaviors (i.e., descriptive norms). We then
              used binomial regression analyses to examine associations between
              network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV
              vulnerability from sex. The results of our LPA indicated that our
              sample experienced five distinct latent profiles of network-level
              norms: (1) low HIV vulnerability network norm, (2) moderately
              high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability
              network norm, (4) condomless sex dominant network norm, and (5)
              approval of drug use during sex dominant network norm. Condomless
              anal sex, group sex, and using drugs to enhance sex were
              positively and significantly associated with higher HIV
              vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV
              vulnerability norm profiles. To mitigate Black SGM's HIV
              vulnerability, future HIV risk reduction strategies can consider
              using network-level intervention approaches such as opinion

              the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show
              that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease
              spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the
              structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and
              edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These
              observations mean that the structure of the live trade network
              can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the
              cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which
              would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact
              structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were
              observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves
              mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle
              corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock
              supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and
              quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a
              land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to
              inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and
              decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine
              deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for
              stakeholders at the local community and across animal health
              services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of
              outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.},

              networks and adverse drug events: A cross-sectional study},
  author = {Leigh Coney and Amy Peacock and Aili Malm and Rasmus Munksgaard and Judith Aldridge and Jason A Ferris and Larissa J Maier and Adam R Winstock and Monica J Barratt},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Drug use and trading are typically social
              activities; however, supply through cryptomarkets can occur
              without any in-person social contact. People who use drugs alone
              may be at higher risk of experiencing harms, for example, due to
              lack of others who may call for emergency assistance.
              Alternatively, cryptomarkets may be a source of harm reduction
              information and drugs with better-known content and dose,
              potentially reducing the risk of adverse events. This study
              examines relationships between cryptomarket use, drug-using
              social networks and adverse drug events for MDMA, cocaine and
              LSD. METHOD: A subsample of 23,053 respondents from over 70
              countries was collected in the 2018 Global Drug Survey. People
              who reported using MDMA, cocaine or LSD were asked about using
              cryptomarkets to purchase these drugs; any adverse drug events
              requiring medical treatment (combining seeking treatment and
              should have sought treatment but did not); and social networks
              who they had used the specific drug with. All measures referred
              to the last 12 months, hereon referred to as 'recent'. Binary
              logistic regressions examined relationships between cryptomarket
              use, drug-using social networks, and adverse drug events,
              controlling for age, gender, and frequency of drug use. RESULTS:
              Adverse events from any drug type were low (5.2\%) and for each
              drug; MDMA (3.5\%); cocaine (3.3\%); and LSD (3.5\%). After
              controlling for covariates, recent cryptomarket use was
              associated with increased likelihood of having no drug-using
              network for each drug type. People who recently used
              cryptomarkets were more likely to report adverse cocaine (AOR =
              1.70 (1.22-2.37)) and LSD (AOR = 1.58 (1.12-2.09)) events. For
              those reporting a network size >1, network characteristics did
              not differ with recent cryptomarket use; however, those reporting
              recent cryptomarket use were more likely to report adverse LSD
              events (AOR = 1.86 (0.99-3.51)). CONCLUSION: People who reported
              purchasing drugs from cryptomarkets more commonly reported having
              no drug-using network, and cryptomarket purchase was associated
              with reported adverse events. Our results support the notion that
              cryptomarket use increases drug-related harm, but further
              disentanglement of multiple complex mechanisms is needed in
              future research.},

  abstract = {The topology of animal transport networks contributes
              substantially to how fast and to what extent a disease can
              transmit between animal holdings. Therefore, public authorities
              in many countries mandate livestock holdings to report all
              movements of animals. However, the reported data often does not
              contain information about the exact sequence of transports,
              making it impossible to assess the effect of truck sharing and
              truck contamination on disease transmission. The aim of this
              study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig transport
              network by means of social network analysis and to assess the
              implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In
              particular, we studied how additional information about transport
              sequences changes the topology of the contact network. The study
              is based on the official animal movement database in Switzerland
              and a sample of transport data from one transport company. The
              results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly
              fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease
              outbreak. By considering the time sequence of transports, we
              found that even in the worst case, only 0.34\% of all farm-pairs
              were connected within one month. However, both network
              connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if
              truck sharing and especially truck contamination were considered.
              Therefore, the extent to which a disease may be transmitted
              between animal holdings may be underestimated if we only consider
              data from the official animal movement database. Our results
              highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts
              between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck
              sharing and contamination. As the nature of animal transport
              networks is inherently temporal, we strongly suggest the use of
              temporal network measures in order to evaluate individual and
              overall risk of disease transmission through animal
              transportation.},

  abstract = {Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role
              in the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of
              SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial
              lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order
              to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be
              explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially
              regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the
              initial stages of resuming research at a large research
              university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact
              network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen
              model describing movement between home and work; we show that
              limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in
              the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen
              spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact
              patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we
              show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than
              labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact
              network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by
              providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue
              that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact
              behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to
              slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-based pharmacovigilance

              of focusing on the detection and identification of Adverse Drug
              Events (ADE) in social media posts in single time points, we
              propose a holistic approach that looks at the evolution of
              different user behavior indicators in time. We examine various
              NLP-based indicators such as word frequency, semantic similarity,
              Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and sentiment analysis. We
              introduce a classification approach to identify normal vs.
              abnormal time periods based on patient comments. This approach,
              along with user behavior indicators, can optimize the

              However, conventional prevention and control strategies, which
              only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently decrease the
              number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode
              is needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a

              the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and

              dynamic cooperative behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data
              collected from 220 participants in 19 social organizations. The
              results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships
              increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the
              network between social organizations became more reliable.
              Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models were
              significant (t-ratio 2). Additionally, the estimated values

              Systems building block framework, analysis of authorship and
              funding patterns, and an exploration of emerging research

              four databases and included literature published in seven

              attributes of research institutions and their transient
              relationships in shaping the global surgery research agenda. We
              identified 2,298 relevant studies out of 92,720 unique articles
              searched. Research output increased from 453 in 2015-16 to 552 in
              2021-22, largely due to literature on Covid-19 impacts on
              surgery. Sub-Saharan Africa (792/2298) and South Asia (331/2298)

              Collaborations during the {MERS} Epidemic in South Korea},
  author = {Minyoung Ku and Ahreum Han and Keon-Hyung Lee},
  abstract = {The debate continues as to which governance structure is most
              appropriate for collaborative disaster response, particularly
              between centralization and decentralization. This article aims to
              contribute to this debate by analyzing the structural
              characteristics of a multisectoral network that emerged and
              evolved under strong state control during the 2015 outbreak of
              Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS) in South
              Korea. This study particularly focuses on the evolution of intra-
              and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The data
              for the study were collected through a content analysis of
              government documents and news articles. Using social network
              analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a
              centralized structure around a small number of governmental
              organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between
              participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network
              displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and
              non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health
              organizations, but under different influences of structural
              characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak
              period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the
              centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally
              be conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health
              disasters, calling for a careful design of governance structures
              for disaster response.},

              destructive consequences on the global poultry production system.
              Recently, a growing number of layer farms have been heavily
              damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased virulence of
              the virus and the intensification of the production system.
              Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive
              practices at the farm level that are aligned with contingency
              measures at the national level to minimize poultry losses.
              However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm workers to
              follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and
              control. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices
              varies with the geographical condition and inter-farm contact
              structures. Hence, the objective of our study was to examine the
              preventive effect of five biosecurity actions commonly practiced
              at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: (i)
              fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a
              farm; iii) disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection
              protocols, iv) an anterior room in the sheds before entering the
              bird area and v) boots changes when moving between sheds in the
              same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer case
              farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI
              epidemic. The odds ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices
              implemented in those study groups were estimated as a preventive
              effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, including seven
              geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian
              hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location
              weighted logistic regression. The results showed that the use of
              a disinfection booth for personnel reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6
              infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 \% credible
              interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial
              variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263). Changing
              boots between sheds on the same farm reduced the odds of HPAIv
              H5N6 infection (AOR = 0.160, 95 \% CrI = 0.024-0.852) with
              relatively wide spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR =
              0.270-0.688). Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols
              at the farm of entry for layer farms is recommended to
              effectively prevent and respond to HPAIv H5N6 infection under
              different local condition. Our study provides an important
              message for layer farmers to effectively implement on-farm
              biosecurity actions against HPAIv H5N6 infection at their farms
              by setting priorities based on their spatial condition and
              network position.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased
              worldwide. Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic
              diseases-is associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of
              mobility and quality of life as well as financial burden.
              Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide
              valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of
              chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard
              as they contain semantic information on patients' health
              conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on
              understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than
              multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression
              of two chronic diseases in the Australian health context. It
              specifically focuses on the comorbidity progression of
              cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes
              mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in
              Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to
              understand and represent the progression of CVD in patients with
              T2DM using graph theory and social network analysis techniques.
              Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and CVD and
              patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative
              dataset obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two
              baseline disease networks were constructed from these two
              selected cohorts. A final disease network from two baseline
              disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a
              normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and
              electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly
              higher in patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only
              T2DM. This showed that these chronic diseases occurred frequently
              during the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM. The proposed
              network-based model may potentially help the healthcare provider
              to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns
              between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could
              be useful for stakeholders including governments and private

  title = {Detection of Hate Speech in {COVID-19-Related} Tweets in the Arab
              Region: Deep Learning and Topic Modeling Approach},
  author = {Raghad Alshalan and Hend Al-Khalifa and Duaa Alsaeed and Heyam Al-Baity and Shahad Alshalan},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The massive scale of social media platforms requires
              an automatic solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic
              solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of
              content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech
              detection problem as a supervised text classification task using
              classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep
              learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in
              Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work
              on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify hate
              speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users
              in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in
              tweets containing hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19
              dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to
              COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed
              for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network
              (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1
              being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix
              factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in
              hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data
              in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets
              greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage
              of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\%
              (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of
              hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) contained a low level of hate
              based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified
              Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19
              hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we
              showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the
              time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate
              tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the
              Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related
              hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination
              of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient
              (r=0.1982},
  p = {.50). The study also identified the commonly
              discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of
              the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics
              were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users
              also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab
              region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19
              pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations
              worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social
              media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on
              the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech
              may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which
              increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate
              speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze
              hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in
              the Arab region.},

  author = {Mariano Kanamori and Mario De La Rosa and Cho-Hee Shrader and Cesar Munayco and Susanne Doblecki-Lewis and Guillermo Prado and Steven Safren and Mary Jo Trepka and Kayo Fujimoto},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miami-Dade County, where many Latina seasonal workers
              reside and work, has the highest incidence of the human
              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the US: a rate four times the
              national average. Despite this disproportionate risk for HIV,
              there are no HIV prevention interventions that aim to decrease
              HIV among Latina seasonal workers. METHODS: The PROGRESO EN SALUD
              study compared the outcomes of two interventions adapted to
              include a social network component (VOICES and HEALTHY).
              Recruitment used a social network respondent-driven sampling
              design in which each seed was asked to recruit three friends, and
              those friends were asked to recruit three friends, for a total of
              twenty groups of 13 friends. We collected data at baseline, and 6
              months and 12 months post intervention completion. We used
              generalized estimating equation models, properly adjusted for
              non-independent contributions of both social network
              interventions, to estimate the effects. Gaussian family
              multivariate models were calculated, addressing exchangeable
              working correlations, including both individual-level and
              cluster-level covariates in these models. RESULTS: A total of 261
              Latina seasonal workers participated in either the HEALTHY or the
              VOICES intervention. There were significant changes over time in
              cognitive factors (HIV knowledge, condom use self-efficacy, and
              adequate knowledge of condom use), behavioral factors (condom
              use, female condom use, and HIV testing), and communication
              factors (talking with friends about HIV prevention and intention
              to negotiate safe sex with male partners). DISCUSSION: This study
              supports the literature suggesting that interventions
              incorporating social networks can have positive effects on HIV
              prevention and treatment outcomes, including sustained benefits

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease that
              is spread via respiratory droplets from infected individuals to
              susceptible contacts. To eliminate this disease from low- and
              medium-incidence settings, people who are most likely to be
              infected (contacts) must be identified. Recently, study authors
              have examined alternate approaches to contact tracing methods
              that demonstrate improved detection and prioritization of
              contacts. The comparative benefit of these methods has not been
              established. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of novel
              methods of contact tracing versus current standard of care to
              identify latent and active cases in low- to moderate-incidence
              settings. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase,
              LILACS, Web of Science, and CINAHL up to 15 July 2019. We also
              searched for clinical trials and examined reference lists and
              conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled
              trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of contact tracing strategies that
              included alternate approaches (other than standard practice).
              DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
              assessed identified articles for eligibility and quality using
              prespecified criteria. MAIN RESULTS: No trials met the inclusion
              criteria of this review. Several study authors described an
              alternate method for examining contacts and performing social

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among
              Inuit in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to
              better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote
              region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: Isolates
              from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit,
              Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing
              (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within
              clusters was calculated using a threshold of a $\leq$3 single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and
              then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a
              reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of
              epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis.
              RESULTS: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
              isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were
              identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster
              represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire
              study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission
              were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless
              shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a
              nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further
              transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also
              confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of
              transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility
              ($\kappa$ score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0).
              CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors,
              namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a
              gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may
              have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in
              this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.},

  author = {Nora M{\a'e}lard and Adeline Grard and Jean-Charles Delvenne and Liesbeth Mercken and Julian Perelman and Anton E Kunst and Vincent Lorant},
  abstract = {Social network research has evidenced the role of peer effects in
              the adoption of behaviours. Little is known, however, about
              whether policies affect how behaviours are shared in a network.
              To contribute to this literature, we apply the concept of
              diffusion centrality to school tobacco policies and adolescent
              smoking. Diffusion centrality is a measure of centrality which
              refers to a person's ability to diffuse a given property-in our
              case, smoking-related behaviours. We hypothesized that stronger
              school tobacco policies are associated with less diffusion
              centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in
              general. A whole network study was carried out in 2013 and 2016
              among adolescents (n = 18,805) in 38 schools located in six
              European cities. Overall, diffusion centrality of smoking in
              general and of smoking on school premises significantly decreased
              over time. Diffusion centrality of smoking significantly
              decreased both in schools where the policy strengthened or
              softened over time, but for diffusion of smoking on school
              premises, this decrease was only significant in schools where it
              strengthened. Finally, stronger school tobacco policies were
              associated with lower diffusion centrality of smoking on school
              premises and of smoking in general, though to a lesser extent.
              With such policies, smoking may, therefore, become less
              prevalent, less popular, and less clustered, thereby lowering the
              risk of it spreading within networks in, and even outside the
              school.},

              networks impact youth risk and resilience, but data are lacking
              on AI adolescent networks. Intergenerational trauma from settler
              colonialism leads some AI youth to early initiation of substance
              use and subsequent substance misuse, along with
              disproportionately high risk for suicide and vulnerability to
              witnessing and experiencing violence. Using network data to
              develop prevention strategies among this population is a
              promising new avenue of research. In this study protocol paper,
              we describe the rationale and methodology of an exploratory study
              to be conducted with American Indian 9th and 10th graders at
              three schools on a Northern Plains reservation. METHODS: This
              mixed methods study will collect quantitative social network
              surveys (N = 300) and qualitative interviews (n = 30). The study
              will examine the extent to which existing social network theories
              and data metrics adequately characterize AI youth networks or how
              they may need to be expanded for this population. Associations of
              network characteristics with risk and protective factors for
              substance use, exposure to violence, and suicide will also be
              examined. DISCUSSION: This innovative methodological approach
              holds promise for informing the development of effective
              preventive approaches to address co-occurring risks for substance
              use, violence and suicide among AI adolescents. Understanding
              processes that impact social networks among AI adolescents can
              promote culturally resonant social relationships that may support
              better outcomes for youth.},

              in Two Factories in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, 2019},
  author = {Suphanat Wongsanuphat and Phanthanee Thitichai and Rungrot Jaiyong and Patchanee Plernprom and Kanthika Thintip and Charuttaporn Jitpeera and Rapeepong Suphanchaimat},
  abstract = {On 22 March 2019 the Thai Department of Disease Control (DDC) was
              notified that 16 workers, including Thai and Myanmar migrant
              workers, from two factories located in Nakhon Phathom Province,
              had presented with a fever with rash during the previous 2 weeks.
              Active case finding was conducted among workers in both factories
              using face-to-face interviews. Suspected cases were defined as a
              worker who developed fever with rash with one of the following
              symptoms: cough, coryza or conjunctivitis. Testing for measles
              IgM antibodies and viral identification through throat swabs by
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to confirm
              diagnosis. Vaccination history among cases was reviewed.
              Nationality and age-specific attack rates (AR) were calculated.
              An environmental study and a social network analysis were
              conducted to better understand the transmission process. A total
              56 cases (AR = 0.97\%) were identified. Of 21 serum measles IgM
              collected, 8 (38.0\%) were positive. Of 8 throat swabs collected,
              5 (62.5\%) were positive for measles genotype D8. The disease
              attack rate in migrant employees was twice as large as the rate
              in Thai counterparts (AR = 0.7 and 1.4\%). The first case was
              identified as a Myanmar worker who arrived in Thailand two weeks
              prior to his illness. The Myanmar workers' accommodation was more
              crowded than that for Thai workers. The hot spots of transmission
              were found at a drinking water tank which had shared glasses.
              Among the cases, 62.5\% could not recall their vaccination
              history, and 25\% had never had an injection containing a measles
              vaccination. The majority of migrant cases had never completed a
              two-dose measles vaccination. To halt the outbreak, measles
              vaccines were administered to the employees, particularly those
              working in the same sections with the cases and shared glasses
              were removed. For future policy action, a vaccination program
              should be incorporated into the work permit issuance process.},

              rare blood clots with the {Oxford/AstraZeneca} {COVID-19} vaccine},
  author = {Ali Hobbs and Aisha Aldosery and Patty Kostkova},
  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an ``infodemic'' of
              misinformation. Misleading narratives around the virus, its
              origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public
              health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between
              the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients
              developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this
              prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility
              COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application
              programming interface was used to collect data containing
              COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a
              period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood
              clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data
              using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We
              subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential
              users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility
              information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research
              presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare
              blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased
              volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content
              propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the
              volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of
              COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The
              research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of
              low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the
              crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of
              low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the
              simple approach adopted within the research to identify the most
              popular and influential sources of low-credibility content
              presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and
              social media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter
              the propagation of misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking

              Columbia},
  author = {Megan Kurz and Brenda Carolina Guerra-Alejos and Jeong Eun Min and Brittany Barker and Bernadette Pauly and Karen Urbanoski and Bohdan Nosyk},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterizing the diffusion of adopted changes in
              policy and clinical practice can inform enhanced implementation
              strategies to ensure prompt uptake in public health emergencies
              and other rapidly evolving disease areas. A novel guidance
              document was introduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in
              British Columbia (BC), Canada, which supported clinicians to
              prescribe opioids, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. We aimed to
              determine the extent to which uptake and discontinuation of an
              initial attempt at a prescribed safer supply (PSS) program were
              influenced through networks of prescribers. METHODS: We executed
              a retrospective population-based study using linked health
              administrative data that captured all clinicians who prescribed
              to at least one client with a substance use disorder from March
              27, 2020, to August 31, 2021. Our main exposure was the
              prescribing patterns of an individuals' peers, defined as the
              proportion of a prescribers' professional network (based on
              shared clients), which had previously prescribed PSS, updated
              monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a clinician had
              prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given calendar
              month. The secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS
              prescribing, defined as an absence for PSS prescriptions for at
              least 3 months. We estimated logistic regression models using
              generalized estimated equations on monthly repeated measurements
              to determine and characterize the extent to which peer networks
              influenced the initiation and discontinuation of PSS prescribing,
              controlling for network, clinician, and caseload characteristics.
              Innovators were defined as individuals initiating PSS prior to
              May 2020, and early adopters were individuals initiating PSS
              after. RESULTS: Among 14,137 prescribers treating clients with
              substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators of prescribed
              safer supply and 1062 early adopters through the end of study
              follow-up, but 653 (50.6\%) were no longer prescribing by August
              2021. Prescribers with over 20\% of peers whom had adopted PSS
              had a nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing
              themselves (aOR: 3.79, 95\% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those
              with no connected safer supply prescribers. CONCLUSIONS: The
              uptake of PSS in BC was highly dependent on the behavior of
              prescribers' peer networks. Future implementation strategies to
              support PSS or other policies would benefit from leveraging
              networks of prescribers.},

              older men with lung cancer in China. METHODS: We analyzed the
              electronic medical records (EMRs) of lung cancer patients over
              age 65 in the Jilin Province of China. The data studied were
              obtained from 20 hospitals of Jilin Province in 2018. In total,
              1510 patients were identified. We conducted a rank-frequency
              analysis and social network analysis to identify the predominant
              comorbidities and comorbidity networks. We applied the
              association rules to mine the comorbidity combination with the
              values of confidence and lift. A heatmap was utilized to
              visualize the rules. RESULTS: Our analyses discovered that (1)
              there were 31 additional medical conditions in older patients
              with lung cancer. The most frequent comorbidities were pneumonia,
              cerebral infarction, and hypertension. (2) The network-based
              analysis revealed seven subnetworks. (3) The association rules
              analysis provided 41 interesting rules. The results revealed that
              hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and pneumonia are the most
              frequent comorbid combinations. Heart failure may not have a
              strong implicating role in these comorbidity patterns. Cerebral
              infarction was rarely combined with other diseases. In addition,
              glycoprotein metabolism disorder comorbid with hyponatremia or
              hypokalemia increased the risk of anemia by more than eight times
              in older lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
              evidence on the comorbidity patterns of older men with lung
              cancer in China. Understanding the comorbidity patterns of older
              patients with lung cancer can assist clinicians in their
              diagnoses and contribute to developing healthcare policies, as
              well as allocating resources.},

              assess the potential risk of pathogens introduction into this
              region and to plan mitigation measures]},
  author = {Alessandra Scaburri and Veronica Cappa and Marco Tironi and Dominga Avisani and Silvia Bellini},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to analyse the trade flow of pigs to Lombardy
              (Northern Italy) to single out the farms more involved in animal
              movements to identify the holdings and areas most exposed to the
              risk of introducing pathogens into the region and to plan proper
              mitigation measures. Indeed, the movement of live animals and of
              the means of transport is one of the main risk factors in the
              spread of diseases and this is particularly relevant in areas
              with high stocking density. DESIGN: statistical analysis on
              movements of pigs entering Lombardy was carried out. Data on
              pigs' movements and farm characteristics were collected from the
              National and Regional databases. Social Network Analysis (SNA)
              was used to analyse the flows of pigs to Lombardy, to identify
              the holdings and geographical areas that are central in the
              trading network and that could have a role in the introduction of
              swine pathogens into the region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data
              on pigs' movements introduced into Lombardy in 2016 were
              analysed. Lombardy is a region of Northern Italy with intensive
              livestock husbandry. The pig sector is of particular economic
              relevance also in view of the processing industry, suited to the
              production of high quality pork products. Annually about 1.8
              million pigs are introduced into the region also to satisfy the
              request of the processing industry for the production of pork
              products. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: in this study, the farms that
              buy pigs from outside the region were identified as well as the
              territories where the largest number of pigs are introduced. The
              analysis was carried out also considering certain factors related
              to the movement of animals, which can be relevant for the
              transmission of pathogens, such as number of commercial partners,
              number of exchanged animals, and number of shipments. RESULTS: in
              2016, 1,782,568 pigs were introduced into Lombardy; by using SNA,
              it was possible to highlight a complex trade network of pigs,
              mainly involving the Northern regions. Indeed, the pigs were
              mostly purchased from Emilia Romagna (33.4\%), followed by Veneto
              and Piedmont. These regions have been the most closely analysed
              in this study. SNA was also used to identify Lombardy territories
              (provinces and municipalities) which, based on the number of
              introduced pigs, are potentially most exposed to the introduction
              of pathogens from outside the region. Mantua and Brescia
              provinces resulted the most exposed area. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is
              one of most important European producers of pigs and about 50\%
              of national pig assets is present in Lombardy; furthermore, about
              1.8 million pigs are introduced yearly into the region.
              Currently, the region is free from the main diseases of pigs and
              the introduction of an epidemic disease into the pig population
              could adversely affect the entire productive sector. For this
              reason, an analysis of the movements of pigs entering the region
              was carried out to identify the areas (provinces, municipalities)
              and holdings most exposed to the risk of introduction of
              pathogens. This information is relevant for the veterinary
              authorities to plan appropriate control activities (official
              controls, surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination, where
              possible) in order to enhance disease prevention and promote
              early detection.},

              and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to
              cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in
              transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's
              disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory
              diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare
