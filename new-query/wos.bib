Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of
   social network analysis to understand public discourse on Twitter around
   the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined
   different network properties that might affect the successful
   dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public
   health officials and health agencies. Methods: We focused on
   conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late
   January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software
   that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as
   Twitter. Results: We found that the network of conversations around
   COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected;
   these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public
   health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation
   can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public
   health. Conclusions: Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading
   picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social
   media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social
   network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral
   part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and
   evaluate risk communication efforts.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives: To understand the research landscape and identify the
   research hotspots and trends of the application of social network theory
   and analysis to public health. Study design: A bibliometric study of
   publications regarding application of social network theory and analysis
   to public health.Methods: Choosing 1607 articles about the application
   of social network theory and analysis to public health from the core
   collection database of Web of Science published from 1991 to 2020 as the
   research sample. A biblio-metric and visual analysis of publication
   quantity and content was performed to analyze time trends, spatial
   distribution, cooperation networks, influential references, and keyword
   co-occurrence, clusters, and emergence. Results: There is an increasing
   trend in the use of social network theory and analysis in the public
   health field, with the United States taking the lead. Research focuses
   include on transmission of diseases or behavior through social networks
   and the influence of social networks on population health at different
   ages. Current research frontiers primarily include the role of social
   networks in tracking of emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19,
   preventing and controlling chronic diseases, and carrying out healthy
   behavioral interventions.Conclusions: This study provides a
   comprehensive quantitative overview of the historic development of and
   latest topics in the application of social network theory and analysis
   method to public health. More attention should be paid to the important
   role of social networks in tracing the emergence of serious infectious
   diseases like COVID-19, as well as preventing and controlling chronic
   diseases and intervening in health behaviors, considering the increasing
   challenges and opportunities presented by online social networking.},

Abstract = {The rapid dissemination of misinformation on social networks,
   particularly during public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, has
   become a significant concern. This study investigates the spread of
   misinformation on social network data using social network analysis
   (SNA) metrics, and more generally by using well known network science
   metrics. Moreover, we propose a process design that utilizes social
   network data from Twitter, to analyze the involvement of non-trusted
   accounts in spreading misinformation supported by a proof-of-concept
   prototype. The proposed prototype includes modules for data collection,
   data preprocessing, network creation, centrality calculation, community
   detection, and misinformation spreading analysis. We conducted an
   experimental study on a COVID-19-related Twitter dataset using the
   modules. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and
   process steps, and provides valuable insight into the application of
   network science metrics on social network data for analysing various

Month = {2022 DEC 31},
Abstract = {Background/Aim The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was officially
   recorded on March 11, 2020. Social media use increased worldwide, as
   well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake
   news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the
   world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions
   related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before
   and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials
   and methods Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and
   after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created
   based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their
   influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters
   that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results In the
   pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine
   views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the
   Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The
   vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and
   the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations
   received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between
   influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions
   This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media
   data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination
   in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of
   the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network
   analysis would help reduce the ``infodemic{''} before administering the
   vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively
   in this regard.},

Abstract = {The inefficient utilization of ubiquitous graph data with combinatorial
   structures necessitates graph embedding methods, aiming at learning a
   continuous vector space for the graph which is amenable to be adopted in
   traditional machine learning algorithms in favor of vector
   representations. Graph embedding methods build an important bridge
   between social network analysis and data analytics as social networks
   naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously.
   Publishing social network data not only bring benefit for public health,
   disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications,
   but also give birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy
   and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social
   graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure
   with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social
   networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a
   sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive
   model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we
   propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using
   adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy
   on sensitive links while persevering sufficient non-sensitive
   information such as graph topology and node attributes in graph
   embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed
   framework using ground truth social network datasets.},

Abstract = {Using social media is one important strategy to communicate research and
   public health guidelines to the scientific community and general public.
   Empirical evidence about which communication strategies are effective
   around breastfeeding messaging is scarce. To fill this gap, we aimed to
   identify influencers in the largest available Twitter database using
   social network analysis (n = 10,694 users), inductively analyze tweets,
   and explore communication strategies, motivations, and challenges via
   semi-structured interviews. Influencers had diverse backgrounds within
   and beyond the scientific health community (SHC; 42.7\%): 54.7\% were
   from the general public and 3\% were companies. SHC contributed to most
   of the tweets (n = 798 tweets), disseminating guidelines and research
   findings more frequently than others (p < 0.001). Influencers from the
   general community mostly tweeted opinions regarding the current state of
   breastfeeding research and advocacy. Interviewees provided practical
   strategies (e.g., preferred visuals, tone, and writing style) to achieve
   personal and societal goals including career opportunities, community
   support, and improved breastfeeding practices. Complex challenges that
   need to be addressed were identified. Ideological differences regarding
   infant feeding may be hampering constructive communication, including
   differences in influencers' interpretation of the WHO International Code
   of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and in perspectives regarding
   which social media interactions encompass conflict of interest.},

Pages = {1310-1327},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, anti-vaccination rhetoric has become part of the
   mainstream discourse regarding the public health practice of childhood
   vaccination. These utilise social media to foster online spaces that
   strengthen and popularise anti-vaccination discourses. In this paper, we
   examine the characteristics of and the discourses present within six
   popular anti-vaccination Facebook pages. We examine these large-scale
   datasets using a range of methods, including social network analysis,
   gender prediction using historical census data, and generative
   statistical models for topic analysis (Latent Dirichletallocation). We
   find that present-day discourses centre around moral outrage and
   structural oppression by institutional government and the media,
   suggesting a strong logic of `conspiracy-style' beliefs and thinking.
   Furthermore, anti-vaccination pages on Facebook reflect a highly
   `feminised' movement the vast majority of participants are women.
   Although anti-vaccination networks on Facebook are large and global in
   scope, the comment activity sub-networks appear to be `small world'.
   This suggests that social media may have a role in spreading
   anti-vaccination ideas and making the movement durable on a global
   scale.},

   PubMed and IEEEXplore were searched from 2009 to 2020 and included 30
   studies after screening and analysis. Twitter, QuitNet, and
   disease-specific online forums were widely used to study communications
   on various health conditions. Most of the studies have performed content
   analysis and network analysis, whereas network modeling has been done in
   six studies. Posts on cancer, COVID-19, and smoking have been widely
   studied. Tools and techniques used for network analysis are listed.
   Health-related social media data can be leveraged for network analysis.

   Methods The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) ontology is a lightweight social

   and relationships from social data to extend its domain scope. Results
   Our effort produced Friend of a Friend with Benefits (FOAF+) ontology

   rules, we defined interpersonal dyadic social connections, which can
   create inferred linked dyadic social representations of individuals,
   represent complex behavioral information, help machines interpret some
   of the concepts and relationships involving human interaction, query
   network data, and contribute methods for analytical and disease

Abstract = {The loss of a baby to stillbirth is a traumatic experience and can lead
   to secondary losses, such as the loss of social relationships. In
   Nigeria, stillbirths are a common public health problem. However,
   limited attention has been given to the social ramifications of
   stillbirths. This study describes the social networks of women who have
   experienced a stillbirth and the factors influencing their social
   networks. Interviews and social network diagrams were used to collect
   data from 20 women about their social networks before and after
   stillbirth. Findings suggest that the experience of shame, unmet
   expectation of support, and a lack of trust led to relationship changes
   after stillbirth. Most participants met bereavement needs with their
   existing social networks before stillbirth, but many participants also
   experienced relationship losses (even among family networks).
   Information from social network analysis can reveal the risks and
   strengths inherent in social networks, which can be helpful for the
   provision of tailored/personalized bereavement care.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundSociometric or whole network analysis, a method used to
   analyze relational patterns among social actors, emphasizes the role of
   social structure in shaping behaviour. Such method has been applied to
   many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public
   health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social
   networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network
   analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current
   scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network
   analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such
   methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of
   six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political
   Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO)
   returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be
   included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social
   network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized
   quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a
   description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network
   analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last
   decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree
   centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong
   to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network
   resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The
   second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social
   support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on
   the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service
   providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network
   SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate
   mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to
   study drug policy.},

Title = {Twitter's Role in Combating the Magnetic Vaccine Conspiracy Theory:
   Social Network Analysis of Tweets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Background: The popularity of the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and
   other conspiracy theories of a similar nature creates challenges to
   promoting vaccines and disseminating accurate health information.
   Objective: Health conspiracy theories are gaining in popularity. This
   study's objective was to evaluate the Twitter social media network
   related to the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and apply social
   capital theory to analyze the unique social structures of influential
   users. As a strategy for web-based public health surveillance, we
   conducted a social network analysis to identify the important opinion
   leaders sharing the conspiracy, the key websites, and the narratives.
   Methods: A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using
   social network analysis. Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13,
   2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. Tweets were retrieved via a
   dedicated Twitter application programming interface. More specifically,
   the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the
   data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research
   Foundation) and Gephi.
   Results: There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users
   within the data set. This study found that the most influential user
   within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the
   magnetic vaccine conspiracy. There were also several other users that
   became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a
   retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the
   network.
   Conclusions: Our study found that influential users were effective
   broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond
   their own networks of Twitter followers. We emphasize the need for trust
   in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in
   the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the
   COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be
   unpredictable. This study highlights the potential of influential users
   to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique
   social capital.},

   conversation themes on Twitter. Methods: Tweets (n = 692) were imported
   from Twitter between 1 and 31 May 2021 using the Twitter public API; and
   uploaded to NodeXL to conduct a social network analysis. Results: Health
   professionals and organizations with medical backgrounds were the main
   content producers, disseminators, and top influencers. However,
   information diffusion is slow and uneven among users. Additionally,
   conversations lacked a focus on preventive behaviors. Conclusion:
   Twitter is a potential platform for the targeted outreach of individuals
   in melanoma awareness campaigns. This study provides insights maximizing
   the effectiveness of Twitter as a communication modality. Our findings
   can help guide the development of customized content and interventions
   during melanoma awareness campaigns.},

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {The development of public health education campaigns about tobacco
   products requires an understanding of specific audience segments
   including their views, intentions, use of media, perceived barriers, and
   benefits of change. For example, identifying and targeting individuals
   who express ambivalence about e-cigarette use on Twitter may be helpful
   in devising and focusing public health campaigns to reduce e-cigarette
   use. This study developed a novel analytic strategy using social network
   analysis to identify audience segments on Twitter based on positive,
   negative, and neutral e-cigarette sentiment Using Twitter data collected
   from April 2015 to March 2016, we identified different sub-groups of
   users who retweeted about e-cigarettes, and measured each subgroup's
   clustering coefficient (CC), which describes how tightly people cluster
   together. Ten high CC and ten low CC groups were randomly selected; then
   100 randomly selected tweets from each group were coded for e-cigarette
   sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Results indicate that
   differences in e-cigarette sentiment are associated with clustering of
   Twitter network ties. Statistical analyses revealed that high CC groups
   were more likely to have strong e-cigarette sentiments, suggesting that
   tightly clustered groups may be ``echo chambers{''} (i.e., like-minded
   people repeating the same messages). By contrast, low CC groups were
   more likely to have neutral sentiments, and had greater fluctuation in
   sentiment over time, suggesting that they may be more flexible in their
   opinions about e-cigarettes and may be particularly receptive to
   targeted public health campaigns. Informatics techniques such as
   determination of clusters using social network analysis can be useful in
   identifying audience segments for future public health campaigns.},

Title = {Online health community for change: Analysis of self-disclosure and
   social networks of users with depression},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background A key research question with theoretical and practical
   implications is to investigate the various conditions by which social
   network sites (SNS) may either enhance or interfere with mental
   well-being, given the omnipresence of SNS and their dual effects on
   well-being.
   Method/process We study SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for
   users' personal (i.e., self-disclosure) and situational (i.e., social
   networks) attributes, using a mixed design of content analysis and
   social network analysis.
   Result/conclusion We compare users' within-person changes in
   self-disclosure and social networks in two phases (over half a year),
   drawing on Weibo Depression SuperTalk, an online community for
   depression, and find: Several network attributes strengthen social
   support, including network connectivity, global efficiency, degree
   centralization, hubs of communities, and reciprocal interactions. Users'
   self-disclosure attributes reflect positive changes in mental well-being
   and increased attachment to the community. Correlations exist between
   users' topological and self-disclosure attributes. A Poisson regression
   model extracts self-disclosure attributes that may affect users'
   received social support, including the writing length, number of active
   days, informal words, adverbs, negative emotion words, biological
   process words, and first-person singular forms.
   Innovation We combine social network analysis with content analysis,
   highlighting the need to understand SNS' effects on well-being by
   accounting for users' self-disclosure (content) and communication
   partners (social networks).
   Implication/contribution Authentic user data helps to avoid recall bias
   commonly found in self-reported data. A longitudinal within-person
   analysis of SNS' effects on well-being is helpful for policymakers in
   public health intervention, community managers for group organizations,
   and users in online community engagement.},

Title = {Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing in a cohort study to
   investigate TB transmission in an educational setting},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Background: TB outbreaks in educational institutions can result in
   significant transmission and pose a considerable threat to TB control.
   Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological
   tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties
   characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole
   genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide
   additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health
   action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with
   traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak
   in an educational setting.
   Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with
   a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through
   laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through
   clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection.
   Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and
   screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M.
   tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial
   regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated
   with case status and risk communities.
   Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7\% positivity rate) and nine
   active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was
   39.1\% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious
   case (odds ratio 7.3, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The
   community structure analysis divided the students into five communities
   based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social
   network analysis identified that the community including the suspected
   index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds
   ratio 7.5, 95\% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were
   lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single
   SNP difference.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an
   undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting
   within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome
   sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission
   network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide
   further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological
   approaches to direct public health action in this setting.},

Title = {Adaptive Renewal of Mountainous Historical Towns Based on the Stability
   of the Social Network Structure: A Case Study in Chongqing, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The stability of social network structure (SSNS) in historical towns is
   influenced by changes in built environments and demographic factors. The
   historical towns in China have evolved into massive rural-urban
   migration under the rapid urbanization over the past forty years. In
   this context, many of these historical towns experienced ``declining
   built environment and disintegrating social networks, `` which does not
   contribute to the adaptive renewal of the built environment and social
   networks in historical towns, as well as the psychological health of
   residents. This article intends to explore the adaptive renewal of the
   built environment and social networks of historical towns based on the
   SSNS. Data on ``households `` and ``social ties `` (i.e., kinship,
   geographic, and job relationship) among households were collected via a
   field survey in seven historical towns in Chongqing, China. K-core
   models of social network analysis (SNA) were calculated to analyze SSNS.
   The result shows that the social networks of historical towns with
   centripetal-shaped structures were more stable than historical towns
   with divergent-shaped structures. Moreover, spatial layout forms and
   functions of households might affect the stability of social networks in
   historical towns. Based on the results of the analysis of SSNS,
   strategies for adaptive renewal of the built environments and social
   networks were put forward in two aspects. The built environment, such as
   the classification of public spaces and service facilities, can be
   designed based on the k-core indicator for increasing the spatial
   connection of households in the historical towns. In addition, increased
   social activities in historical towns with weak SSNS may promote social
   connection of households, and are also helpful in boosting public health
   in psychological aspects.},

Title = {Social Influence Maximization for Public Health Campaigns},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {151252-151260},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of online medical treatments, social media has
   become a prevalent platform to spread health-related information. For
   public health campaigns, how to diffuse the message broadly and
   efficiently in the social network is a classical problem, which is named
   Influence Maximization (IM). IM can be considered as an algorithmic
   problem of finding a small set of network users as seed nodes that
   maximizes the spread of influence for a piece of information under a
   certain influence cascade model. With a lot of researches focusing on
   this field, most existing solutions are proposed to extract seed nodes
   only considering pure topological structures. In practice, nodes in
   health-related networks are often abundantly accompanied with other
   types of meaningful information such as node attributes (identity),
   second-order proximity, and edge attributes (user relationship), while
   conventional IM models overlook these information. Therefore, a general
   framework for incorporating the heterogeneous information into an IM
   model could be potentially helpful to find underlying seed nodes in
   health-related networks. Moreover, the stability and the computational
   cost are also the main challenges that current IM models face. To bridge
   these gaps, in this paper, we propose NE-IM (Network Embedding for
   Influence Maximization), a method that aspires to address both problems
   using representation learning. NE-IM composes of two components:
   Structure-based embedding and feature-based embedding. They are the
   projections of network structures and heterogeneous information
   respectively in a low dimensional space, so that each node in
   health-related network can be represented as a fix dimensional vector.
   Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform
   baseline approaches.},

Title = {Social Media Multidimensional Analysis for Intelligent Health
   Surveillance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Recent work in social network analysis has shown the
   usefulness of analysing and predicting outcomes from user-generated data
   in the context of Public Health Surveillance (PHS). Most of the
   proposals have focused on dealing with static datasets gathered from
   social networks, which are processed and mined off-line. However, little
   work has been done on providing a general framework to analyse the
   highly dynamic data of social networks from a multidimensional
   perspective. In this paper, we claim that such a framework is crucial
   for including social data in PHS systems. Methods: We propose a dynamic
   multidimensional approach to deal with social data streams. In this
   approach, dynamic dimensions are continuously updated by applying
   unsupervised text mining methods. More specifically, we analyse the
   semantics and temporal patterns in posts for identifying relevant
   events, topics and users. We also define quality metrics to detect
   relevant user profiles. In this way, the incoming data can be further
   filtered to cope with the goals of PHS systems. Results: We have
   evaluated our approach over a long-term stream of Twitter. We show how
   the proposed quality metrics allow us to filter out the users that are
   out-of-domain as well as those with low quality in their messages. We
   also explain how specific user profiles can be identified through their
   descriptions. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed multidimensional
   model can be used to identify main events and topics, as well as to
   analyse their audience and impact. Conclusions: The results show that
   the proposed dynamic multidimensional model is able to identify relevant
   events and topics and analyse them from different perspectives, which is
   especially useful for PHS systems.},

Title = {COVID-19 and the ``Film Your Hospital{''} Conspiracy Theory: Social
   Network Analysis of Twitter Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy
   theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a
   hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are ``empty.{''} Research has
   shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that
   an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and
   other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second
   wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of
   the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it.
   Objective: This study set out to evaluate the \#FilmYourHospital
   conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers
   behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which
   online sources of information were used as evidence to support the
   theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and
   what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy
   theory in the future.
   Methods: Twitter data related to the \#FilmYourHospital hashtag were
   retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day
   period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets
   and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify
   accounts with a higher probability of being bots.
   Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are
   ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit
   supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked
   to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter
   user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the
   platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and
   deleted accounts within the network.
   Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be
   targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation.
   Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or
   remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities
   could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative
   content.},

Abstract = {Background: Community-academic partnerships (CAPs) in public health are
   increasingly utilized to integrate community voice into decision-making
   processes of health-related interventions, programs, and practice.
   However, community partners' collaboration experiences remain
   understated in the literature. Thus, there is a need to further advance
   methodological approaches that examine the effectiveness of CAPs, while
   also highlighting community voice to, ultimately, improve public health
   outcomes.
   Objectives: (1) To demonstrate how a practical approach to mixed methods
   social network analysis (MMSNA) can highlight power dynamics in
   community health partnerships and use MMSNA data to build relationships
   across stakeholders for systems change efforts
   Methods: MMSNA was used to examine a CAP focused on public health equity
   in a Midwest region. The project applied a sequential mixed methods
   design (QUAN -> QUAL) with a network survey and individual
   semi-structured interviews. Both data strands served the function of
   expansion, where quantitative data identified what relationships existed
   in the network, level of activity, and factors for motivations,
   providing breadth of collaboration. Qualitative data further elaborated
   on how partners perceived these experiences, providing depth and
   contextualizing quantitative results.
   Conclusions: Systems level approaches must be applied to capture broader
   contexts (e.g., community, interpersonal, and individual) surrounding
   community health partnerships. The use of MMSNA maximizes benefits from
   a systems methodology-social network analysis-with qualitative
   interviews that allow for the critical assessment of network structure
   and community centered perspectives. Community health partnerships are
   encouraged to utilize this approach in order to deliver more sustainable
   public health efforts centered on the community that is directly
   impacted.},

   more recently been used to study health-related topics including
   obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and
   healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial
   analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or
   built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence,
   quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network
   processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some
   common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social
   networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social
   network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and
   reproducibility.
   Methods:
   We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology
   focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks,
   take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own
   connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters.
   Results:
   We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health
   outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model
   selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection
   considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and
   health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social
   network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also
   present an example of SNA.
   Conclusions:
   SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how
   relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors-and
   subsequently health.},

Abstract = {Social media is not only an essential platform for the dissemination of
   public health-related information, but also an important channel for
   people to communicate during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social bots
   can interfere with the social media topics that humans follow. We
   analyzed and visualized Twitter data during the prevalence of the Wuhan
   lab leak theory and discovered that 29\% of the accounts participating
   in the discussion were social bots. We found evidence that social bots
   play an essential mediating role in communication networks. Although
   human accounts have a more direct influence on the information diffusion
   network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social
   bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion,
   humans are vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the
   spread of unverified messages across social media. These findings show
   that limiting the use of social bots might be an effective method to
   minimize the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.},

Title = {Navigating the asthma network on Twitter: Insights from social network
   and sentiment analysis},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {BackgroundAsthma is a condition in which the airways become inflamed and
   constricted, causing breathing difficulties, wheezing, coughing, and
   chest tightness. Social networks can have a substantial effect on asthma
   management and results. However, no studies of social networks
   addressing asthma have been undertaken.ObjectiveThe aim of this research
   was to identify the significant social network structures, key
   influencers, top topics, and sentiments of asthma-related Twitter
   conversations.MethodsAll the tweets collected for this study included
   the keyword ``asthma{''} or were mentioned in or in replies to tweets
   that were performed. For this study, a random sample of Twitter data was
   collected using NodeXL Pro software between December 1, 2022, and
   January 29, 2023. The data collected includes the user's display name,
   Twitter handle, tweet text, and the tweet's publishing date and time.
   After being imported into the Gephi application, the NodeXL data were
   then shown using the Fruchterman-Reingold layout method. In our study,
   SNA (Social Network Analysis) metrics were utilized to identify the most
   popular subject using hashtags, sentiment-related phrases (positive,
   negative, or neutral), and top influencer by centrality measures
   (degree, betweenness).ResultsThe study collected 48,122 tweets
   containing the keyword ``asthma{''} or mentioned in replies. News
   reporters and journalists emerged as top influencers based on centrality
   measures in Twitter conversations about asthma, followed by government
   and healthcare institutions. Education, trigger factors (e.g., cat
   exposure, diet), and associated conditions were highly discussed topics
   on asthma-related social media posts (e.g., sarscov2, copd). Our study's
   sentiment analysis revealed that there were 8427 phrases associated
   neutral comments (18\%), 12,582 words reflecting positive viewpoints
   (26\%), and 27,111 words reflecting negative opinions
   (56\%).ConclusionThis study investigates the relevance of social media
   influencers, news reporters, health experts, health organizations, and
   the government in the dissemination and promotion of asthma-related
   education and awareness during public health information.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {452-460},
Month = {2020 JUL},
Abstract = {Objective Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are continually emerging
   and threatening health care systems. Little attention has been paid to
   the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care
   entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department
   of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social
   network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in
   Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in
   Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed
   network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of
   relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance
   data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include
   metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such
   as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional
   networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed
   that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the
   flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not
   be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care
   hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental
   health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for
   flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health
   care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals.
   Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public
   health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining
   which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination
   of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This
   information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and
   develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt
   MDRO transmission across a health care network.},

Pages = {E184-E191},
Month = {2023 AUG},
Abstract = {Background Exposure to visual posts featuring e-cigarette products on
   social media is associated with increased e-cigarette use among US
   adolescents. Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media
   marketing, where influencers-for example, bloggers, brand
   ambassadors-post promotional materials. This study analysed the network
   of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the
   most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. Methods We
   tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted
   promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and
   high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of
   1\%-25\% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we
   identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities)
   influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers'
   followers aged 13-17 years old and the age verification practices
   restricting youth access were also assessed. Results There is a highly
   interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55)
   worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The
   Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers
   compared with the European influencers. 75\% of the influencers did not
   restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The
   brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso
   collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20).
   Conclusions It is important to understand associations among influencers
   and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective
   public health communication and potential policies that could regulate
   social media marketing sponsored by e-cigarette companies.},

Abstract = {Social media discourse has become a key data source for understanding
   the public's perception of, and senti-ments during a public health
   crisis. However, given the different niches which platforms occupy in
   terms of information exchange, reliance on a single platform would
   provide an incomplete picture of public opinions. Based on the schema
   theory, this study suggests a `social media platform schema' to indicate
   users' different expectations based on previous usages of platform and
   argues that a platform's distinct characteristics foster distinct
   platform schema and, in turn, distinct nature of information. We
   analyzed COVID-19 vaccine side effect -related discussions from Twitter,
   Reddit, and YouTube, each of which represents a different type of the
   platform, and found thematic and emotional differences across platforms.
   Thematic analysis using k-means clustering algorithm identified seven
   clusters in each platform. To computationally group and contrast
   thematic clusters across platforms, we employed modularity analysis
   using the Louvain algorithm to determine a semantic network structure
   based on themes. We also observed differences in emotional contexts
   across platforms. Theoretical and public health implications are then
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Rationale/purpose: Multi-sectoral partnerships have become a common
   strategy for addressing persistent public health issues, such as
   physical inactivity, mental health disorders and chronic illnesses. Yet,
   little is known about the role of the park and recreation sector to such
   health sector initiatives. The purpose of our study was to analyse the
   flow of information across a multi-sectoral mental health group hiking
   programme in Canada.
   Design/methodology/approach: We used an online questionnaire to survey
   social service agency staff involved in delivering the programme in 63
   communities. We collected data about their information seeking practices
   regarding four types of information: hiking and parks, mental health,
   funding sources, and the Mood Walks programme.
   Findings: Social network analysis confirmed that social service agencies
   turned to park and recreation sector partners for information about
   hiking and local hiking amenities but did not seek information from them
   about mental health, funding sources, or the programme itself.
   Practical implications: Park and recreation sector partners are viewed
   by other sectoral partners as sources of critical information in the
   delivery of this park-based health initiative.
   Research contribution: This study illustrates the utility of social
   network analysis in understanding multi-sectoral park-based health
   programmes and confirms the relevance of the park and recreation sector
   to public health initiatives in nature settings.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of Facebook and YouTube in potentially
   exposing people to COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation.
   Specifically, to study the potential level of exposure, the article
   models a uni-directional information-sharing pathway beginning when a
   Facebook user encounters a vaccine-related post with a YouTube video,
   follows this video to YouTube, and then sees a list of related videos
   automatically recommended by YouTube. The results demonstrate that
   despite the efforts by Facebook and YouTube, COVID-19 vaccine-related
   misinformation in the form of anti-vaccine videos propagates on both
   platforms. Because of these apparent gaps in platform-led initiatives to
   combat misinformation, public health agencies must be proactive in
   creating vaccine promotion campaigns that are highly visible on social
   media to overtake anti-vaccine videos' prominence in the network. By
   examining related videos that a user potentially encounters, the article
   also contributes practical insights to identify influential YouTube
   channels for public health agencies to collaborate with on their public

   centrality and was used to identify key hashtags and content. Results:
   The overall shape of the network resembled a community network because
   there was a range of users conversing amongst each other in different
   clusters. It was found that a range of accounts were influential and/or
   mentioned within the network. These ranged from ordinary citizens,
   politicians, and popular culture figures. The most common theme and
   popular hashtags to emerge from the data encouraged the public to wear
   masks. Conclusion: Towards the end of June 2020, Twitter was utilized by
   the public to encourage others to wear masks and discussions around

   sources including government portals, public commentary, social
   organizations, market updates, and healthcare institutions. Post data
   collection, the structures, collaboration objectives, and participating
   entities within each time slice were explored using social network
   analysis.ResultsThe findings suggest that the law of evolution for
   information collaboration in public health emergencies primarily starts
   with small-scale collaboration, grows to full-scale in the middle phase,
   and then reverts to small-scale in the final phase. The network's
   complexity increases initially and then gradually decreases, mirroring
   changes in collaboration tasks, objectives, and strategies.DiscussionThe
   dynamic pattern of information collaboration highlighted in this study
   offers valuable insights for enhancing emergency management
   capabilities. Recognizing the evolving nature of information
   collaboration can significantly improve information processing

Title = {Analyzing Social Media to Explore the Attitudes and Behaviors Following
   the Announcement of Successful COVID-19 Vaccine Trials: Infodemiology
   Study},

Abstract = {Background: The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has brought vaccine
   hesitancy to the forefront in managing this pandemic. COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to
   the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread
   global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online
   information, particularly information on social media. The first step
   toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the
   current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization
   debate on social media platforms.Objective: We aimed to evaluate
   societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19
   vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform
   communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance.Methods: Social
   network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to
   characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets
   published in English and French were collected through the Twitter
   application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just
   following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was
   used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions
   on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised
   machine learning approach to natural language processing using a
   sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual
   similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine
   hesitancy.Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main
   themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of
   safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the
   government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety
   and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation
   around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the
   population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and
   there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly
   one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) of the conversations on COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of
   institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and
   nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) expressed criticism toward the
   government's handling of the pandemic.Conclusions: Social media content
   analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into
   the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of
   safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered,
   as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed
   on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.},

Title = {An ontology-based multi-domain model in social network analysis:
   Experimental validation and case study},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {540},
Pages = {390-413},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of social network theory and methods of analysis have been
   applied to different domains in recent years, including public health.
   The complete procedure for carrying out a social network analysis (SNA)
   is a time-consuming task that entails a series of steps in which the
   expert in social network analysis could make mistakes. This research
   presents a multi-domain knowledge model capable of automatically
   gathering data and carrying out different social network analyses in
   different domains, without errors and obtaining the same conclusions
   that an expert in SNA would obtain. The model is represented in an
   ontology called OntoSNAQA, which is made up of classes, properties and
   rules representing the domains of People, Questionnaires and Social
   Network Analysis. Besides the ontology itself, different rules are
   represented by SWRL and SPARQL queries. A Knowledge Based System was
   created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a real case study in order to
   show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the results of an SNA
   analysis obtained through the model were compared to those obtained from
   some of the most widely used SNA applications: UCINET, Pajek, Cytoscape
   and Gephi, to test and confirm the validity of the model. (c) 2020

Abstract = {The inefficient utilization of ubiquitous graph data with combinatorial
   structures necessitates graph embedding methods, aiming at learning a
   continuous vector space for the graph, which is amenable to be adopted
   in traditional machine learning algorithms in favor of vector
   representations. Graph embedding methods build an important bridge
   between social network analysis and data analytics, as social networks
   naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously.
   Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public
   health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other
   applications, but also gives birth to threats that jeopardize each
   individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in
   publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social
   graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited
   from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence
   of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a
   predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this
   paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding
   framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's
   prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient
   non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in
   graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the
   proposed framework using ground truth social network datasets.},

   GVP-citing articles},
Journal = {MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND The Global Virome Project (GVP) was proposed in 2018 as an
   evolution of the USAID PREDICT project and was presented as a
   ``collaborative scientific initiative to discover zoonotic viral threats
   and stop future pandemics{''}. The immediate response was mixed, with
   public health and scientific communities representatives showing
   skepticism, if not direct opposition.OBJECTIVES The economic, social,
   and health consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   pandemic demonstrated how unprepared the world was in the face of new
   pandemics. This paper analyses the impact of the GVP on the scientific
   and public health communities.METHODS Published scientific articles that
   cited the two 2018 seminal publications proposing the project were
   analysed using social network analysis methods.FINDINGS Encompassing the
   periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results
   indicate that (i) the concepts of the GVP have received more support
   than opposition in the scientific literature; (ii) its foundations
   should be updated to address the specific criticisms.MAIN CONCLUSIONS
   Shifting focus to national virome projects can provide tangible,
   regional benefits that can positively contribute towards a consensus on
   achieving a high level of preparedness for the ever-present possibility
   of the following global viral pandemic.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged public health practitioners and
   clinicians at multiple levels to intentionally consider the impact of
   social isolation on health outcomes. Many community-based programmes
   design interventions to address tangible challenges within the social
   determinants of health, such as asset insecurity or food insecurity, to
   address health inequities. The growing need to address social isolation
   within marginalised communities also requires organisations to
   collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen their own
   social integration within the community. The present research reports on
   the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of community programmes
   within three southern U.S. cities and their local collaborations to
   address social isolation. After interviewing representatives of 46
   community organisations, it was found that social service organisations
   that also offer public health services play a central role in community
   efforts to improve social isolation. The participating organisations
   primarily collaborate through referrals and information sharing, and
   report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition that social
   services and supports play a considerable role in addressing health
   inequities, this study provides evidence of opportunities for
   interorganisational collaboration to promote individual and community
   health.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {This study aims at developing and demonstrating in a real case study a
   methodology for supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services in
   the design and assessment of preventive measures to reduce the risks of
   COVID-19 outbreaks within their entities. The proposed methodology
   applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current
   challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2
   among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of
   employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as
   common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion,
   like sharing an office or participating in the same management board.
   The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are
   the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to
   be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the
   designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for
   its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been
   demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing
   promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights
   provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the
   Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of
   the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of
   the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period.
   The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and
   methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for
   preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature
   does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its
   adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is
   still a challenge.},

Abstract = {Transcending the binary categorization of racist texts, our study takes
   cues from social science theories to develop a multidimensional model
   for racism detection, namely stigmatization, offensiveness, blame, and
   exclusion. With the aid of BERT and topic modelling, this categorical
   detection enables insights into the underlying subtlety of racist
   discussion on digital platforms during COVID-19. Our study contributes
   to enriching the scholarly discussion on deviant racist behaviours on
   social media. First, a stage-wise analysis is applied to capture the
   dynamics of the topic changes across the early stages of COVID-19 which
   transformed from a domestic epidemic to an international public health
   emergency and later to a global pandemic. Furthermore, mapping this
   trend enables a more accurate prediction of public opinion evolvement
   concerning racism in the offline world, and meanwhile, the enactment of
   specified intervention strategies to combat the upsurge of racism during
   the global public health crisis like COVID-19. In addition, this
   interdisciplinary research also points out a direction for future
   studies on social network analysis and mining. Integration of social
   science perspectives into the development of computational methods
   provides insights into more accurate data detection and analytics.},

Title = {Opinion Leaders and Structural Hole Spanners Influencing Echo Chambers
   in Discussions About COVID-19 Vaccines on Social Media in China: Network
   Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Background: Social media provide an ideal medium for breeding and
   reinforcing vaccine hesitancy, especially during public health
   emergencies. Algorithmic recommendation-based technology along with
   users' selective exposure and group pressure lead to online echo
   chambers, causing inefficiency in vaccination promotion. Avoiding or
   breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior.
   Objective: With the ultimate goal of eliminating the impact of echo
   chambers related to vaccine hesitancy on social media during public
   health emergencies, the aim of this study was to develop a framework to
   quantify the echo chamber effect in users' topic selection and attitude
   contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations; detect online opinion
   leaders and structural hole spanners based on network attributes; and
   explore the relationships of their behavior patterns and network
   locations, as well as the relationships of network locations and impact
   on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers.
   Methods: We called the Sina Weibo application programming interface to
   crawl tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user
   information on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Adopting social
   network analysis, we examined the low echo chamber effect based on
   topics in representational networks of information, according to
   attitude in communication flow networks of users under different
   interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual
   analyses were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users
   (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and to explore their
   function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo
   chambers.
   Results: Users showed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic
   selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was
   more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, whereas the opposite
   trend was found for the latter. Speakers, replicators, and monologists
   tended to be opinion leaders, whereas common users, retweeters, and
   networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and
   spanners tended to be ``bridgers{''} to disseminate diverse topics and
   communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes toward COVID-19
   vaccines. Moreover, users who tended to echo a single topic could bridge
   multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also
   tended to serve as bridgers for different attitudes.
   Conclusions: This study not only revealed a low echo chamber effect in
   vaccine hesitancy, but further elucidated the underlying reasons from
   the perspective of users, offering insights for research about the form,
   degree, and formation of echo chambers, along with depolarization,
   social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination
   pattern of topic, and sentiment. Therefore, this work can help to
   provide strategies for public health and public opinion managers to
   cooperate toward avoiding or correcting echo chamber chaos and
   effectively promoting online vaccine campaigns.},

Abstract = {Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major concern for public health
   organizations worldwide, especially as regards the adolescent
   population. The consumption of alcohol in adolescents is known to be
   influenced by seeing friends and even parents drinking alcohol. Building
   on this fact, a number of studies into alcohol consumption among
   adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to
   study the different social networks (peers, friends, family, etc.) with
   whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need an initial
   phase of data gathering by means of questionnaires and a subsequent
   analysis phase using the SNA techniques. The process involves a number
   of manual data handling stages that are time consuming and error-prone.
   The use of knowledge engineering techniques (including the construction
   of a domain ontology) to represent the information, allows the
   automation of all the activities, from the initial data collection to
   the results of the SNA study. This paper shows how a knowledge model is
   constructed, and compares the results obtained using the traditional
   method with this, fully automated model, detailing the main advantages
   of the latter. In the case of the SNA analysis, the validity of the
   results obtained with the knowledge engineering approach are compared to
   those obtained manually using the UCINET, Cytoscape, Pajek and Gephi to
   test the accuracy of the knowledge model. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {COVID-19 and the 5G Conspiracy Theory: Social Network Analysis of
   Twitter Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus
   disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, which has led to
   increased discussions across online platforms. These conversations have
   also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst
   them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading
   to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom.
   The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies
   oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the
   drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with
   such misinformation.
   Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content
   analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to
   Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was
   trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were
   analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes
   were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's
   vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore
   algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined.
   Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network
   structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The
   analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who
   was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed
   that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\% (n=81) contained views that 5G and
   COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and
   33.0\% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or
   opinions. Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy
   theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted
   high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy.
   This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web
   source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The
   study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the
   conspiracy theory on Twitter.
   Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions
   oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to
   reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the
   conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets
   inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that
   policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are
   based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the
   ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This
   study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of
   COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in
   how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.},

   users. The study compares the differences in behavioral characteristics
   and diffusion mechanisms between bot users and human users during public
   opinion dissemination, using public health emergencies as the research
   target, and further provides specific explanations for the differences.
   First, the study classified users with bot characteristics and human
   users by establishing the relevant formulas of user indicator
   characteristics. Secondly, the study used deep learning methods such as
   Top2Vec and BERT to extract topics and sentiments, and used social
   network analysis methods to construct network graphs and compare network
   attribute features. Finally, the study further compared the differences
   in information dissemination between posts published by bot users and
   human users through multi-factor ANOVA. It was found that there were
   significant differences in behavioral characteristics and diffusion
   mechanisms between bot users and human users. The findings can help
   guide the public to pay attention to topic shifting and promote the
   diffusion of positive emotions in social networks, which in turn can
   better achieve emergency management of emergencies and the maintenance
   of online orders.},

Title = {Exploring time evolution characteristics of the collaborative mode in
   emergency information release of public health emergencies: A network
   analysis of response to COVID-19 from the central government of China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Emergency information release during public health emergencies is a
   governance measure to slow down the spread of the epidemic and guide the
   public in scientific protection. Because of the uncertainty and
   life-cycle characteristics of public health emergencies, emergency
   information release represents the process of time dynamics. At present,
   it is an inevitable trend to establish a collaborative mechanism for
   emergency information release of public health emergencies to improve
   the release efficiency and respond to public demand. To determine time
   evolution characteristics of organizational collaboration in emergency
   information release, this study took the response to COVID-19 from the
   central government of China as an example and conducted research based
   on social network analysis. Based on information from COVID-19-related
   press conferences held by China's central government, the emergency
   information release collaborative networks (EIRCNs), and Emergency
   Organizations-Emergency Information Release Matters (EOs-EIRMs) 2-mode
   network were constructed. With the time evolution, the tightness,
   convergence, stability, and connectivity of EIRCNs in public health
   emergencies presented the process of lowering and then raising. At
   different stages, the core emergency organization (EO) nodes in EIRCNs
   continued to maintain a certain degree of activity. Their dynamic
   processes showed the characteristics of diversification rather than
   homogeneity. The time evolution of emergency information release matters
   (EIRMs) reflected the dynamic adjustment of the government's prevention
   and control measures and responded to the diversification of the
   public's understanding and protection needs during different stages of
   the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further examined the driving factors
   and implementation mechanism of the time evolution characteristics of
   the collaborative mode of emergency information release. The
   implementation of EIRMs at different stages had different resource
   requirements, which were usually achieved by introducing new EOs (Adding
   resource increment) or increasing the collaborative frequencies among
   EOs (Activating resource stock). In addition, further research prospects
   and feasibility interpretation were proposed.},

Abstract = {The information propagation of emergencies in social networks is often
   accompanied by the dissemination of the topic and emotion. As a virtual
   sensor of public emergencies, social networks have been widely used in
   data mining, knowledge discovery, and machine learning. From the
   perspective of network, this study aims to explore the topic and emotion
   propagation mechanism, as well as the interaction and communication
   relations of the public in social networks under four types of
   emergencies, including public health events, accidents and disasters,
   social security events, and natural disasters. Event topics were
   identified by Word2vec and K-means clustering. The biLSTM model was used
   to identify emotion in posts. The propagation maps of topic and emotion
   were presented visually on the network, and the synergistic relationship
   between topic and emotion propagation as well as the communication
   characteristics of multiple subjects were analyzed. The results show
   that there were similarities and differences in the propagation
   mechanism of topic and emotion in different types of emergencies. There
   was a positive correlation between topic and emotion of different types
   of users in social networks in emergencies. Users with a high level of
   topic influence were often accompanied by a high level of emotion

Title = {Identifying Potential Super-Spreaders and Disease Transmission Hotspots
   Using White-Tailed Deer Scraping Networks},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {White-tailed deer (WTD) spread communicable diseases such as the
   coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and
   chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious, brain disease
   occurring in species of the deer family. Currently, it is not well
   understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we
   speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via
   direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at
   scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more
   contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. Using
   social network analysis, we identified potential superspreaders among
   multiple communities of a rural WTD herd in Mississippi. Analysis of age
   structure revealed that the majority of potential super-spreaders were
   young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also compared infection risk
   across the landscape by combining social network analysis and
   heatmapping software to locate disease transmission hotspots, where the
   risk of disease transmission is higher as compared to other locations.
   We also monitored predator and hunting activity and hunter deer harvests
   to better understand how predators influence social networks and
   potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity
   influenced the age structure of male WTD communities. We assessed
   disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter
   harvests or the removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented
   WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall,
   this study demonstrates a model for predicting potential super-spreaders
   of diseases, describes new methods to locate transmission hotspots, and
   provides new knowledge for disease management and prevention strategies.
   White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, WTD) spread communicable
   diseases such the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major
   public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal,
   highly contagious prion disease occurring in cervids. Currently, it is
   not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper,
   we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via
   direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at
   scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more
   contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. In this
   study, we used network analysis from scrape visitation data to identify
   potential super-spreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD
   herd. We combined local network communities to form a large region-wide
   social network consisting of 96 male WTD. Analysis of WTD bachelor
   groups and random network modeling demonstrated that scraping networks
   depict real social networks, allowing detection of direct and indirect
   contacts, which could spread diseases. Using this regional network, we
   model three major types of potential super-spreaders of communicable
   disease: in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness potential
   super-spreaders. We found out-degree and betweenness potential
   super-spreaders to be critical for disease transmission across multiple
   communities. Analysis of age structure revealed that potential
   super-spreaders were mostly young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We
   also used social network analysis to measure the outbreak potential
   across the landscape using a new technique to locate disease
   transmission hotspots. To model indirect transmission risk, we developed
   the first scrape-to-scrape network model demonstrating connectivity of
   scrape sites. Comparing scrape betweenness scores allowed us to locate
   high-risk transmission crossroads between communities. We also monitored
   predator activity, hunting activity, and hunter harvests to better
   understand how predation influences social networks and potential
   disease transmission. We found that predator activity significantly
   influenced the age structure of scraping communities. We assessed
   disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter
   harvests or removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD
   social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this
   study demonstrates a model capable of predicting potential
   super-spreaders of diseases, outlines methods to locate transmission
   hotspots and community crossroads, and provides new insight for disease
   management and outbreak prevention strategies.},

   Amplifying the COVID-19 ``infodemic{''}},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 26-min
   documentary entitled Plandemic was released online and fanatically
   shared via Twitter and other major social media platforms. The producers
   of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy
   theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated
   disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching
   citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary
   propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health
   interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in
   conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we
   examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a
   case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By
   comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication
   patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the
   Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the
   campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on
   Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the
   documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its
   misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments
   regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy
   theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the
   public's willingness to comply with public health measures. Our results
   show the necessity of further research about sophisticated social
   experiments such as the Plandemic disinformation campaign and provide
   important insights for policy-making to combat the spread of health
   misinformation during public health crises.},

Abstract = {IntroductionUnintentional injury among children represents a major
   public health problem. Online-social-network-based
   parental-health-education is a potential way to reduce child
   unintentional injuries. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms by
   which online-social-network-based health education may reduce the
   unintentional injuries among children aged 0-3 years. MethodsWe
   conducted a participant-blinded, randomized controlled,
   online-social-network-based health-education intervention study from
   March 2019 to February 2020 in Shanghai. We established four WeChat
   groups (two intervention groups and two control groups). For the
   intervention groups, a doctor's assistant regularly delivered
   information regarding unintentional injuries among children, and
   community childcare doctors answered parents' questions concerning their
   children's health, including unintentional injuries. Meanwhile, the
   control groups did not receive any information from the assistant. The
   study selected one intervention group and one control group and compared
   the ego network and whole network indicators to determine the
   differences between the intervention and control groups. ResultsIn the
   intervention and control groups, 64.5\% and 31.9\% of the members,
   respectively, engaged in communication, and 1,736 and 273 records,
   respectively, were obtained. Regarding ego network, the doctor showed
   the largest network in the intervention group, and the size of the
   intervention group's network was twice that of the control group; the
   number of ties in the intervention group was nine times that of the
   control group. Fourteen and four parents in the intervention and control
   group played an active role, respectively. Regarding centrality, all
   WeChat groups were loose and multiple centers existed. Regarding
   subgroup cohesion, the intervention group had 28 cliques with 27
   members, and the control group had 4 cliques with 4 members. For
   structural hole, 23.7\% and 7.5\% members in the intervention and
   control group actively participated in interactions, respectively,
   having strong control and influence over other parents; 69.2\% and
   59.1\% members in the intervention and control group, respectively, had
   values of < 1.000, showing that they had strong ability to cross-jump
   structural holes. DiscussionOnline-social-networks-based health
   education interventions could enhance communication among parents, and
   between parents and community childcare doctors, and also shorten the
   social distance between them. Thus, online-social-network-based
   parental-health-education-intervention can be a feasible and
   generalizable means of preventing unintentional injuries among children.},

Journal = {JOURNALISM PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 23},
Abstract = {Although journalists' social media sourcing can empower non-elite
   sources and diversify public discussions, counterarguments maintain that
   social media sourcing relies on a small group of elites and reinforces
   social division. To contribute to that debate, we examined how health
   journalists from the mainstream news organizations in the U.S. used
   Twitter's @mention for sourcing during the first three months of the
   COVID-19 outbreak. Using a sample of public Twitter posts published by
   the journalists, we formed co-@mentioned networks (i.e., two sources
   were connected if @mentioned in the same post) to examine the structure
   of the networks and identify important sourcing informants. Among the
   results, elite sources (e.g., health journalists and health experts in
   the public sector) and influential users (i.e., verified users with a
   large number of followers and who post frequently) dominated the
   sourcing repertoire. Moreover, the networks were fragmented because the
   sources were clustered into several close-knit subgroups. Analyzing
   exponential random graph models to examine the formation mechanism of
   the networks revealed that, as the pandemic's severity increased,
   influential users played a more salient role in the sourcing repertoire,
   and a homogeneous cluster consisting of journalists and news
   organizations emerged.},

Abstract = {The transmission of online emergency information has become an active
   means of expressing public opinion and has vitally affected societal
   emergency response techniques. This paper analyzes interactions between
   three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible,

   major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide
   these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public
   health events, and social security events-and conduct a simulation using
   three examples from each group. The results show that government control
   of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at
   the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government,
   the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens
   trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make
   cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of
   online public sentiment.},

Title = {How did Ebola information spread on twitter: broadcasting or viral
   spreading?},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {BackgroundInformation and emotions towards public health issues could
   spread widely through online social networks. Although aggregate metrics
   on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little
   about how information spreads on online social networks. Health
   information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or
   from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim
   of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information
   on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola
   messages.MethodsOur data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all
   Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31,
   2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter
   content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis
   was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to
   describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network
   into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user,
   disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting
   patterns.ResultsOn average, 91\% of the retweets were directly retweeted
   from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5\% of the retweeting paths of
   the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its
   immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting
   was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users
   and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators
   and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the
   viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers
   via influential and hidden influential users.ConclusionsBroadcasting was
   the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event
   on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work
   beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the
   message across, because influential and hidden influential users can
   reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter
   accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users
   can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential
   users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective
   communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges
   remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine how factual
   information and misinformation are being shared on Twitter by
   identifying types of social media users who initiate the information
   diffusion process.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed methodology
   approach to analyze tweets with COVID-19-related hashtags. First, a
   social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who
   initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative
   content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to
   identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and
   disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings
   Results - found very little misinformation and disinformation
   distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual
   COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum
   engagement. Tweets by citizens focusing on personal experience or
   opinions received more retweets and likes compared to any other sender
   type. Similarly, celebrities received more replies than any other sender
   type.
   Practical implications - This study helps medical experts and government
   agencies understand the type of COVID-19 content and communication being
   shared on social media for population health purposes.
   Originality/value - This study offers insight into how social media
   users engage with COVID-19-related information on Twitter and offers a
   typology of categories of information shared about the pandemic.

Abstract = {BackgroundCitizen science is a growing practice in which volunteers,
   including non-scientists, conduct or contribute to research by
   collecting and analyzing data. The increasing importance of citizen
   science in the last years has led to an increased interest in detecting
   how citizen science can contribute to scientific advancements in
   different areas. Recent research shows that citizen science has become a
   means of engagement between scientist and the public, encouraging
   scientific curiosity and promoting scientific knowledge. MethodsIn this
   article, we report on how to apply computational analysis techniques to
   Twitter messages to reveal the impact of citizen science in
   health-related areas. The main objectives are (1) to characterize
   central topics of these discussions, and (2) to identify particularly
   important actors in these social media networks. ResultsFor the topics,
   our findings suggest that sustainable development goals, technologies
   and health, and COVID-19 are those most addressed by the users. Other
   topics represented in the data are cancer, public health, mental health,
   and health and well being of sea and earth living creatures related to
   sustainable development goals. ConclusionBased on our results, those
   entities or actors who are most cited and retweeted are Twitter accounts

   It can also be used to assess the outcomes of the intervention, such as
   its success in increasing network connectivity; changing the position of
   certain actors; and bridging across specialties, organizations, and
   sectors. We provided an overview of how an SNA lens can shed light on

Month = {2022 APR},
Abstract = {COVID-19 has created long-lasting yet unprecedented challenges
   worldwide. In addition to scientific efforts, political efforts and
   public administration are also crucial to contain the disease.
   Therefore, understanding how multi-level governance systems respond to
   this public health crisis is vital to combat COVID-19. This study
   focuses on China and applies social network analysis to illustrate
   interactive governance between and within levels and functions of
   government, confirming and extending the existing Type I and Type II
   definition of multi-level governance theory. We characterize four
   interaction patterns-vertical, inter-functional, intra-functional, and
   hybrid-with the dominant pattern differing across governmental functions
   and evolving as the pandemic progressed. Empirical results reveal that
   financial departments of different levels of government interact through
   the vertical pattern. At the same time, intra-functional interaction
   also exists in provincial financial departments. The supervision
   departments typically adopt the inter-functional pattern at all levels.
   At the cross-level and cross-function aspects, the hybrid interaction
   pattern prevails in the medical function and plays a fair part in the
   security, welfare, and economic function. This study is one of the first
   to summarize the interaction patterns in a multi-level setting,
   providing practical implications for which pattern should be applied to
   which governmental levels/functions under what pandemic condition.},

Abstract = {Objective To quantify variation in public health system engagement with
   tribal organizations across a national sample of communities and to
   identify predictors of engagement. Data Sources We used 2018 National
   Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems data, a nationally
   representative cohort of the US public health systems. Study Design
   Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of
   tribal organization participation in public health networks and to
   understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal
   organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models
   estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified
   random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574
   respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also
   surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request
   of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were
   restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska
   Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of
   258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN
   serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations
   participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented
   public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more
   comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services
   participating in the network and the scope of public health activities
   implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The
   likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of
   the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian
   Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to
   reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public
   health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even
   when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of
   tribal organizations remains low.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION Research on electronic cigarettes is an emerging field,
   with the number of articles in this field noted to have grown
   exponentially over recent years. We used a bibliometric analysis method
   (co-word analysis) to analyze the emerging trends and research hotspots
   in this field.
   METHODS Publication data on electronic cigarettes from 2010 to 2018 were
   retrieved and downloaded from the PubMed database. Theme trends and
   knowledge structures were analyzed on the relevant research fields of
   electronic cigarettes by using a biclustering analysis, strategic
   diagram analysis, and social network analysis methods. Research hotspots
   were extracted and compared from three periods.
   RESULTS Core topics that have continuously develop between the years
   2010 and 2018 include: tobacco use cessation devices; tobacco products;
   tobacco use cessation devices/adverse effects; smoking prevention and
   adverse effects; electronic nicotine delivery systems/economics; and
   public health. Some currently undeveloped topics that could be
   considered as new future research directions include: tobacco use
   disorder/therapy; tobacco use disorder/epidemiology;
   students/psychology; students/statistics and numerical data; adolescent
   behavior/psychology; nicotine/toxicity; nicotinic
   agonists/administration and dosage; and electronic nicotine delivery
   systems/legislation and jurisprudence.
   CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that some currently immature topics in
   strategic coordinates and emerging hotspots in social network graphs can
   be used as future research directions.},

   to describe the approach of a social network analysis supporting the
   development of a cross-company network promoting physical activity and
   to present first results. In the process of developing the
   methodological approach, a common understanding of the nodes and edges
   within the project was elaborated. Based on the BIG-model as the
   theoretical framework of the project, five measuring points and an
   application-oriented data collection table were determined. Using Gephi,
   network size, degree, and distance measures, as well as density and
   clustering measures, were calculated and visualized in the course of the
   time. First results showed a continuous expansion and densification of
   the network. The application experience showed that the application of
   social network analysis in practical cross-company network development
   is promising but currently still very resource intensive. In order to
   address the current major challenges and enable routine application, the

Abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is a public health priority due to holistic
   health benefits; however, many adults do not meet PA guidelines. Few
   studies have examined Mexican-heritage fathers' social networks,
   specifically with whom they are physically active. This study examines
   changes in Mexican-heritage fathers' PA networks after participation in
   a father-focused, family-centered health program. Families consisting of
   child (aged 9-11 years), mother, and father were recruited from colonias
   on the Texas-Mexico border for participation in a 6-week father-focused,
   family-centered program concentrated on healthy eating and active
   living. Fathers reported up to 5 people with whom they were active most
   in the previous month before and after the program as well as how often
   they were active with the person and what activities they did most
   often. Multilevel regression models examined changes in networks.
   Fathers (n = 42; mean age = 39.07 years, SD = 7.45) were significantly
   more likely to report more frequent PA with others after the program as
   compared with before. General active play and conditional support were
   mentioned most frequently. This study provides context to the social
   networks and PA behaviors of Mexican-heritage fathers and suggests that
   a father-focused, family-centered health program can increase the PA

Title = {Parallel and distributed paradigms for community detection in social
   networks: A methodological review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},
Month = {2022 JAN},
Abstract = {Community detection in social networks is the process of identifying the
   cohesive groups of similar nodes. Detection of these groups can be
   helpful in many applications, such as finding networks of protein
   interaction in biological networks, finding the users of similar mind
   for ads and suggestions, finding a shared research field in
   collaborative networks, analyzing public health, future link prediction
   in social networks, analyzing criminology, and many more. However, with
   the increase in the number of profiles and content shared on social
   media platforms, the analysis is often time-consuming and exhaustive. In
   order to speed up and optimize the community detection process, parallel
   processing and Shared/Distributed memory techniques are widely used.
   Despite community detection has widespread use in social networks, no
   attempt has ever been made to compile and systematically discuss
   research efforts on the emerging subject of identifying parallel and
   distributed methods for community detection in social networks. Most of
   the surveys described the serial algorithms used for community
   detection. Our survey work comes under the scope of new design
   techniques, exciting or novel applications, components or standards, and
   applications of an educational, transactional, and co-operational
   nature. This paper accommodates and presents a systematic literature
   review with state-of-the-art research on the application of parallel
   processing and Shared/Distributed techniques to determine communities
   for social network analysis. Advanced search strategy has been performed
   on several digital libraries for extracting several studies for the
   review. The systematic search landed in finding 3220 studies, among
   which 65 relevant studies are selected after conducting various
   screening phases for further review. The application of parallel
   computing, shared memory, and distributed memory on the existing
   community detection methodologies have been discussed thoroughly. More
   specifically, the central significance of this paper is that a
   systematic literature review is conducted to gather the relevant studies
   from different digital libraries and gray literature. Then, different
   parametric values of each selected study are appropriately compared.
   Moreover, the need for further research to speed up the process of
   community formation in parallel and shared approaches has been
   pinpointed more suitably. A pictorial glance of this paper is depicted

Abstract = {Research on medical practice that uses big data has attracted
   considerable attention recently. In this paper, we focused on a large
   set of patient referral data gathered in Fujian province, China, between
   2009 and 2011. We built a directed weighted patient referral network. By
   using four metrics from network science, namely, the power-law
   distribution, global rich-club coefficient, local rich-club coefficient,
   and assortativity coefficient, we identified a significant rich-club
   phenomenon in this network. In addition, the community detection was
   also carried out to find the relationship between rich members and
   non-rich members. The findings indicate an oligopoly in which Class-III
   hospitals occupy an overwhelmingly dominant position over the
   competition. Also, the characteristic `significant regional clustering'
   was inferred from the results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Real-time Twitter interactions during World Breastfeeding Week: A case
   study and social network analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Using Twitter to implement public health awareness campaigns is on the
   rise, but campaign monitoring and evaluation are largely dependent on
   basic Twitter Analytics. To establish the potential of social network
   theory-based metrics in better understanding public health campaigns, we
   analyzed real-time user interactions on Twitter during the 2020 World
   Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as an exemplar case. Social network analysis
   (SNA), including community and influencer identification, as well as
   topic modeling were used to compare the activity of n = 29,958 campaign
   participants and n = 10,694 reference users from the six-months
   pre-campaign period. Users formed more inter-connected relationships
   during the campaign, retweeting and mentioning each other 46,161 times
   compared to 10,662 times in the prior six months. Campaign participants
   formed identifiable communities that were not only based on their
   geolocation, but also based on interests and professional background.
   While influencers who dominated the WBW conversations were
   disproportionally members of the scientific community, the campaign did
   mobilize influencers from the general public who seemed to play a
   ``bridging{''} role between the public and the scientific community.
   Users communicated about the campaign beyond its original themes to also
   discuss breastfeeding within the context of social and racial
   inequities. Applying SNA allowed understanding of the breastfeeding
   campaign's messaging and engagement dynamics across communities and
   influencers. Moving forward, WBW could benefit from improving targeting
   to enhance geographic coverage and user interactions. As this exemplar
   case indicates, social network theory and analysis can be used to inform
   other public health campaigns with data on user interactions that go
   beyond traditional metrics.},

Title = {Tweets Related to Motivation and Physical Activity for Obesity-Related
   Behavior Change: Descriptive Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background: Obesity is one of the greatest modern public health
   problems, due to the associated health and economic consequences.
   Decreased physical activity is one of the main societal changes driving
   the current obesity pandemic. Objective: Our goals are to fill a gap in
   the literature and study whether users organically utilize a social
   media platform, Twitter, for providing motivation. We examine the topics
   of messages and social network structures on Twitter. We discuss social
   media's potential for providing peer support and then draw insights to
   inform the development of interventions for long-term health-related
   behavior change.
   Methods: We examined motivational messages related to physical activity
   on Twitter. First, we collected tweets related to physical activity.
   Second, we analyzed them using (1) a lexicon-based approach to extract
   and characterize motivation-related tweets, (2) a thematic analysis to
   examine common themes in retweets, and (3) topic models to understand
   prevalent factors concerning motivation and physical activity on
   Twitter. Third, we created 2 social networks to investigate organically
   arising peer-support network structures for sustaining physical activity
   and to form a deeper understanding of the feasibility of these networks
   in a real-world context.
   Results: We collected over 1.5 million physical activity-related tweets
   posted from August 30 to November 6, 2018. A relatively small percentage
   of the tweets mentioned the term motivation; many of these were made on
   Mondays or during morning or late morning hours. The analysis of
   retweets showed that the following three themes were commonly conveyed
   on the platform: (1) using a number of different types of motivation
   (self, process, consolation, mental, or quotes), (2) promoting
   individuals or groups, and (3) sharing or requesting information. Topic
   models revealed that many of these users were weightlifters or people
   trying to lose weight. Twitter users also naturally forged relations,
   even though 98.12\% (2824/2878) of these users were in different
   physical locations.
   Conclusions: This study fills a knowledge gap on how individuals
   organically use social media to encourage and sustain physical activity.
   Elements related to peer support are found in the organic use of social
   media. Our findings suggest that geographical location is less important
   for providing peer support as long as the support provides motivation,
   despite users having few factors in common (eg, the weather) affecting
   their physical activity. This presents a unique opportunity to identify
   successful motivation-providing peer support groups in a large user
   base. However, further research on the effects in a real-world context,
   as well as additional design and usability features for improving user
   engagement, are warranted to develop a successful intervention
   counteracting the current obesity pandemic. This is especially important
   for young adults, the main user group for social media, as they develop
   lasting health-related behaviors.},

Abstract = {Introduction Tobacco harm reduction (THR) discourse has been divisive
   for the tobacco control community, partially because it sometimes aligns
   public health and tobacco industry interests. Industry funding is
   contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed
   in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed
   and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network
   analysis. Methods We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts
   (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry
   (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including
   government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network
   analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by
   assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the
   frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to
   form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of
   funding, and THR stance. Results About 284 (20\%) out of 1405 authors
   were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central
   and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median
   = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and
   higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more
   influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors.
   E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association
   with undisclosed industry support. Conclusions Authors with industry
   support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse
   than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering
   to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An
   increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be
   necessary to achieve funding parity.},

   Methods and results We used three social media assessment tools (Sprout
   Social, SocioViz, and Symplur) and Google Trends to obtain data about
   the total tweets and global impressions from countries worldwide about
   World Hypertension Day. Social network analysis of top influencers,
   associated hashtags, and keywords was performed to understand the
   context of the posts. With over 60 000 tweets reaching more than 250
   million impressions, World Hypertension Day was a highly impactful
   event. A large spike of over 800\% yearly increase was seen in 2021 that
   has greatly facilitated wider dissemination. However, there was limited
   collaboration among the top influencers and negligible participation
   from several African and non-English-speaking European countries.
   Conclusion With support from several governmental bodies, organizations
   and media outlets, World Hypertension Day is a highly impactful
   healthcare awareness day and presents a global case study of effectively
   utilizing digital resources for creating awareness among the global
   audience. Prioritizing equitable involvement from underrepresented and
   underprivileged communities must be focused. Future policy development

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Coordination of care requires information exchange between
   health workers. The structure of their information exchange networks may
   influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of
   this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in
   primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021.
   As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused
   on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2
   diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure
   (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of
   connections, density and centralization for each of the health
   conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive
   findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in
   primary care practices.
   Results: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25
   practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of
   information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic
   diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected
   networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low
   hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with
   low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17
   for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information
   sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members.
   Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with
   nurses and pharmacists.
   Conclusions: This study identified four types of information exchange
   structures, which provides a practical tool for management and
   improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer
   connections and could hardly be considered a network.},

Volume = {148},
Abstract = {We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel coronavirus
   (COVID-19) outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to assess the potential of
   SNA as a tool for outbreak monitoring and control. We analysed contact
   tracing data of 1147 COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years,
   61.99\% aged 11-40, 742 males), anonymised and made public by the
   Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to
   create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases)
   and edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree was
   1-47 for 199 (17.35\%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76\%)
   nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness.
   Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44\% cases. Bangalore city had the
   highest caseload in the state (229, 20\%), but comparatively low cluster
   formation. Thirty-four (2.96\%) `super-spreaders' (outdegree > 5) caused
   60\% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can
   allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint
   key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for
   rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially
   achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.},

Abstract = {In this study, a mixed-methods research approach was employed,
   integrating social network analysis, descriptive analysis, and
   inferential statistical analysis to examine the health topic subject
   directories and the inter-connections among health topics within the
   subject directory system of the MedlinePlus portal. One hundred and
   fifty-nine health topics related to children's health as well as 1457
   qualified keywords were collected and analyzed. As a result, 184 new
   connections (140 bidirectional and 44 unidirectional) were proposed to
   be added to the original subject directory on MedlinePlus. Five new core
   topics were identified as influential topics in the subject network.
   This new optimized structural network was proved to be significantly
   improved from the original one and the importance of the newly
   identified core topics were verified. The evaluations also included
   participants containing both medical professionals (2) and medical
   students (31). The user evaluation results confirmed that the
   recommendations suggested by this study are solid and effective. The
   findings of this research would improve the information searching
   effectiveness for the portal users and offer insights to public health
   portal creators.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study examined the way organizations were involved in
   the response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
   (MERS-CoV, MERS) outbreak that occurred in Korea in 2015. Data and
   Methods: We collected organizational network data through a content
   analysis of online news articles and the government's white paper.
   Social network analysis was used to analyze the key organizations and
   their connections in crucial response tasks. Results: Three national
   health authorities (Central MERS Management Headquarters {[}CMMH], Korea
   Centers for Disease Control {[}KCDC], Ministry of Health and Welfare
   {[}MOHW]) led the response. CMMH, which did not appear in the
   government's response plans, played a significant role in all 3
   networks. KCDC also was involved in all 3 networks, but was most
   prominent in the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared only in the
   patient management network. Each health authority coordinated and
   collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the networks,
   but unclear lines of responsibilities also were found. Conclusions: The
   study demonstrated that the roles and responsibilities of health
   authorities at the national level were fragmented and lacked clarity.
   Public health emergency preparedness must consider carefully the way to

Abstract = {Fusing models from epidemiology and network science, Block et al. show
   how to ease lockdown and slow infection spread by strategic modification
   of contact through seeking similarity, strengthening communities and
   repeating interaction in bubbles.
   Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic
   consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the
   development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a
   social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three
   distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance
   in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few
   repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity
   across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies.
   We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from
   infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical
   relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social
   network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness
   of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide
   scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied
   in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences
   of social isolation.},

Abstract = {Language and cultural barriers among migrant workers hamper access to

   This study used a parallel mixed-methods design combined with in-depth

   and Phuket provinces. We conducted purposive sampling of representatives
   from public and non-public organisations and local communities.
   Thirty-six key informants participated in in-depth interviews, and
   fifty-six respondents completed the questionnaire for social network
   analysis. Although health risk communication included various
   activities, there was no formal governing body responsible for health
   risk communication among migrants, and monitoring and evaluation of
   communication process were not well-implemented. The health risk
   communication network was centralised, especially in the rural area;
   however, migrant health volunteers (MHVs) and local media were key
   sources of information for most migrants in communities. Overall, a
   governing body led by the government with intersectional collaboration
   and a health risk communication process should be promoted while
   considering migrants' characteristics and concerns. The health risk
   communication network should identify key communicators such as MHVs and
   local media. This can be an effective strategy to fill the gap of

Journal = {HEALTH SERVICES INSIGHTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {The emergence of the new coronavirus in late 2019 further highlighted
   the human need for solutions to explore various aspects of deadly
   pandemics. Providing these solutions will enable humans to be more
   prepared for dealing with possible future pandemics. In addition, it
   helps governments implement strategies to tackle and control infectious
   diseases similar to COVID-19 faster than ever before. In this article,
   we used the social network analysis (SNA) method to identify high-risk
   areas of the new coronavirus in Iran. First, we developed the mobility
   network through the transfer of passengers (edges) between the provinces
   (nodes) of Iran and then evaluated the in-degree and page rank
   centralities of the network. Next, we developed 2 Poisson regression
   (PR) models to predict high-risk areas of the disease in different
   populations (moderator) using the mobility network centralities
   (independent variables) and the number of patients (dependent variable).
   The P-value of .001 for both prediction models confirmed a meaningful
   interaction between our variables. Besides, the PR models revealed that
   in higher populations, with the increase of network centralities, the
   number of patients increases at a higher rate than in lower populations,
   and vice versa. In conclusion, our method helps governments impose more
   restrictions on high-risk areas to handle the COVID-19 outbreak and
   provides a viable solution for accelerating operations against future
   pandemics similar to the coronavirus.},

   elimination plans},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Author summarySchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases
   which is planned for elimination by 2030. Eliminating the disease
   requires collaboration among important government, community, healthcare
   providers and non-governmental organizations representatives working on
   schistosomiasis. The current level of cooperation and collaboration
   among these representatives in Oyo state, Nigeria is unknown. This study
   aimed to measure the extent and strength of collaboration among these
   representatives looking at three relationships: contact, collaboration
   and resource sharing activities using social network analysis method.
   Undertaking this research will support a better understanding of
   barriers against meeting the disease elimination deadline. The social
   network analysis found that the three relationships patterns had
   considerable clustering among representatives and few connections,
   signifying low interconnectedness across several representative groups.
   The contact and collaborative relationships were the most active, with
   the resource-sharing network having the lowest amount of
   interconnectedness. Representatives were more active in rural areas than
   urban, and representatives in the organized government and the public
   health system were the most active actors in the schistosomiasis control
   program. The schistosomiasis control program's representative's poor
   connectedness, unbalanced relationships patterns should be addressed in
   order to stimulate improvement and reach the WHO schistosomiasis
   elimination objective.
   BackgroundSchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases
   targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease elimination requires
   collaboration between stakeholders, country ownership and the
   involvement of community-level stakeholders. The state of stakeholder
   relationship determines the ease and timeliness of meeting disease
   elimination targets. Mapping stakeholder relationships is critical for
   assessing gaps in the schistosomiasis control program implementation,
   and providing a roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study
   aimed to measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and
   resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo state,
   Nigeria. Materials and methodsThis study used a Network Representative
   design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The study was conducted within
   Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North
   (urban) and Akinyele (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a
   link-tracing approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from
   stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare, academia,
   and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed using Gephi
   software for network cohesion across the three networks. ResultsThe
   social network analysis revealed high clustering and low density across
   the three networks implying low cohesion across multiple stakeholder
   categories. The contact and collaborative networks were the most active
   with the lowest level of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network.
   Stakeholders were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and
   stakeholders within the organized governance and public health system
   were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control program.
   ConclusionThe low cohesion, high clustering and low network density
   among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis control program should be
   addressed in other to drive innovation and meet the WHO schistosomiasis
   elimination target.},

Abstract = {The debate continues as to which governance structure is most
   appropriate for collaborative disaster response, particularly between
   centralization and decentralization. This article aims to contribute to
   this debate by analyzing the structural characteristics of a
   multisectoral network that emerged and evolved under strong state
   control during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory
   syndrome-coronavirus (MERS) in South Korea. This study particularly
   focuses on the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties
   in the network. The data for the study were collected through a content
   analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network
   analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized
   structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the
   central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations
   rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal
   ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and
   nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of
   structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the
   peak period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the
   centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally be
   conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health disasters,
   calling for a careful design of governance structures for disaster
   response.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {325},
Month = {2023 MAY},
Abstract = {Mass vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention in response to
   public health events. Thus, equitable access to vaccine products is
   essential to ensure global human health. Based on the global vaccine
   product trade data from 2000 to 2018 and employing social network
   analysis, this paper explores the unbalanced pattern of global vaccine
   product trade and assesses the sensitivity interdependence between
   countries. Overall, the analysis shows that global vaccine product trade
   links have long been highly concentrated within developed countries in
   Europe and America. Nevertheless, with the rise of global and regional
   hub countries, the global vaccine product trade network has begun to
   evolve from a unipolar structure with the U.S. as the sole core to a
   multipolar structure with the U.S. and Western European countries as the
   core. Meanwhile, emerging countries, represented by China and India, are
   increasingly participating in the global vaccine product trade network
   and are beginning to play an important role. The formation of this
   multipolar pattern has provided countries in the Global South with more
   options for cooperation in the vaccine product trade and reduces the
   sensitivity inter-dependence of network periphery countries on core
   countries, which consequently reduces the global supply risk of vaccine
   products.},

Month = {2021 MAY},
Abstract = {Human relationships are influenced by the underlying emotions in their
   interactions. With the increasing use of social networks, relationships
   from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such
   interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available
   in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts.
   Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for
   numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In
   this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification
   using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple
   intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The
   objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and
   natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto
   a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over
   time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of
   conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine
   emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association
   classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for
   classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in
   research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our
   analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of
   behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human
   relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect
   interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85\%. The evaluation
   shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from
   conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex
   relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in
   emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time.},

Abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 misinformation on social media has elicited
   concern amongst scholars, health agencies and governments owing to its
   potential harms to public health. This article addresses the question of
   how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19
   facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After
   reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our
   analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of
   COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health
   professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the
   capacities of `actor-actants' and `issue-actants,' and between the
   adoption of `field' and `contested' hashtags during a controversy. We
   identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts
   such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and
   researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these
   actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these
   categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or
   retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of
   Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to
   facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as \#hydroxychloroquine attracted
   significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that
   they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed
   them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the
   `echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy
   implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in
   health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting
   misinformation.},

Abstract = {Adolescents with chronic pain (ACP) often experience impairments in
   their social functioning. Little is known about the consequences of
   these impairments on peer relationships of ACP. This study applied
   social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain
   problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems
   name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2),
   dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less
   positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship
   qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate
   the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study
   used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which
   followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3,
   Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4,
   standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested
   within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less
   popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated
   each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third,
   results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more
   pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less
   positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents
   with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship
   qualities moderated the relationship between pain and emotional
   distress. This study contributes to the literature on the importance of
   peer relationships of ACP. Clinical implications and directions for
   future research are discussed.},

   result was observed for two reasons. First, unrealized or newly emerging
   relationships among planned actors contributed to the low congruence.
   Second, the response plan overlooked the role and relationships of
   several intermediary actors between the local and national actors in the
   government system. The broad implication is that public health emergency

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health crisis that has
   affected economies and societies worldwide. During these times of
   uncertainty and crisis, people have turned to social media platforms as
   communication tools and primary information sources. Online discourse is
   conducted under the influence of many different factors, such as
   background, culture, politics, etc. However, parallel comparative
   research studies conducted in different countries to identify
   similarities and differences in online discourse are still scarce. In
   this study, we combine the crisis lifecycle and opinion leader concepts
   and use data mining and a set of predefined search terms (coronavirus
   and COVID-19) to investigate discourse on Twitter (101,271 tweets) and
   Sina Weibo (92,037 posts). Then, we use a topic modeling technique,
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the most common issues
   posted by users and temporal analysis to research the issue's trend.
   Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to discover the opinion leader
   on the two different platforms. Finally, we find that online discourse
   reflects the crisis lifecycle according to the stage of COVID-19 in
   China and the US. Regarding the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, users
   of Twitter tend to pay more attention to the economic situation while
   users of Weibo pay more attention to public health. The issues focused
   on in online discourse have a strong relationship with the development
   of the crisis in different countries. Additionally, on the Twitter
   platform many political actors act as opinion leaders, while on the
   Weibo platform official media and government accounts control the
   release of information.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased online interactions and
   the spread of misinformation. Some researchers anticipate benefits
   stemming from improved public awareness of the value of vaccines while
   others worry concerns around vaccine development and public health
   mandates may have damaged public trust. There is a need to understand
   whether the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine mandates
   have influenced HPV vaccine attitudes and sentiments to inform health
   communication strategies.MethodsWe collected 596,987 global
   English-language tweets from January 2019-May 2021 using Twitter's
   Academic Research Product track. We determined vaccine confident and
   hesitant networks discussing HPV immunization using social network
   analysis. Then, we used a neural network approach to natural language
   processing to measure narratives and sentiment pertaining to HPV
   immunization.ResultsMost of the tweets in the vaccine hesitant network
   were negative in tone (54.9\%) and focused on safety concerns
   surrounding the HPV vaccine while most of the tweets in the vaccine
   confident network were neutral (51.6\%) and emphasized the health
   benefits of vaccination. Growth in negative sentiment among the vaccine
   hesitant network corresponded with legislative efforts in the State of
   New York to mandate HPV vaccination for public school students in 2019
   and the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a Global Health Emergency in
   2020. In the vaccine confident network, the number of tweets concerning
   the HPV vaccine decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic but in both
   vaccine hesitant and confident networks, the sentiments, and themes of
   tweets about HPV vaccine were unchanged.ConclusionsAlthough we did not
   observe a difference in narratives or sentiments surrounding the HPV
   vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased focus on
   the HPV vaccine among vaccine confident groups. As routine vaccine
   catch-up programs restart, there is a need to invest in health
   communication online to raise awareness about the benefits and safety of
   the HPV vaccine.},

Title = {Dynamic Network of Interactions in the Wildlife-Livestock Interface in
   Mediterranean Spain: An Epidemiological Point of View},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The correct management of diseases that are transmitted between wildlife
   and livestock requires a reliable estimate of the pathogen transmission
   rate. The calculation of this parameter is a challenge for
   epidemiologists, since transmission can occur through multiple pathways.
   The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to
   its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles
   for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic
   network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using
   information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven
   fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored
   using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16
   proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social
   network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions,
   including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of
   different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within
   this network. The results show a high connection between species through
   indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of
   new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities
   that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission
   of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be
   playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock.
   The present work shows the need to consider different types of
   methodologies in order to understand the complete functioning of the
   network of interactions at the wildlife/livestock interface. It also
   provides a methodological approach applicable to the management of
   shared diseases.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Past research has identified the importance of cooperation among
   community-based organizations from different sectors to address public
   health problems such as insufficient physical activity. However, little
   is known about how and why interorganizational cooperation occurs. The
   present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of
   interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical
   activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in
   Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61
   network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of
   sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to
   examine network properties and exponential random graph models were
   estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of
   cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of
   cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to
   occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of
   cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the
   community department for education and sports being the most central
   network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of
   organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and
   reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant
   mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical
   activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage
   networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for
   improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in
   both the present and other research areas of health promotion.},

Month = {2021 DEC},
Abstract = {Public health emergencies, especially major infectious diseases, may
   cause global crises. Timely and effective communication is essential for
   response to such incidents. However, the emergency response to such
   incidents usually lasts longer and break out repeatedly, and the
   existing static emergency communication network (ECN) analysis cannot
   fully reflect the dynamic information interaction between organizations
   during the emergency process. Therefore, this article takes the recent
   COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China as a case, and uses social network
   analysis to reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks,
   positions, roles, and tasks of organizations from the time dimension.
   The results show that: (1) the ECN has changed from concentrated to
   decentralized over time; (2) the positions and roles of participating
   organizations in the ECN has changed, but there are still a few key
   organizations that at the central position in all phases of emergency
   communication; (3) the core tasks have changed due to emergency needs at
   each stage; (4) under the concentrated management system, the core
   organization of the ECN mainly comes from government organizations. The
   research results reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks
   between different types of emergency organizations, which is beneficial
   to guide emergency management of public health emergencies. In actual
   emergency, the emergency communication mode should be dynamically
   adjusted based on the characteristics of the emergency situation at
   different stages, comprehensively using the advantages of the
   concentrated and decentralized emergency network. In addition,
   communication between different types of organizations such as
   governments, research institutions, and enterprises should be
   strengthened, and channels for diversified organizations to participate
   in emergency communication should be set up. The research helps to
   improve communication between emergency response organizations and is of
   great significance to controlling and reducing the harm caused by public
   health emergencies.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Objective
   Excessive alcohol consumption in adolescents is one of the most
   significant public health problems currently facing society. Social and
   geographical contexts contribute to the development of alcohol-related
   behavior in adolescents. The aim of this research is to analyze the
   social pattern related to alcohol consumption in adolescents based on
   their geographical environment.
   Methodology
   We designed a descriptive cross-sectional study based on social network
   analysis. We recruited 196 high school students between 16 and 18 years
   of age to participate in the study. The methodology applied was social
   network analysis by means of transitivity and homophily social triads.
   The data were analyzed using STATA statistical software.
   Results and conclusions
   A total of 58.48\% of rural adolescents consumed alcohol compared to
   49.52\% of urban adolescents. These results demonstrate that adolescents
   who live in rural areas exhibit a greater risk of drinking alcohol than
   those who live in urban areas. The presence of transitive triads
   increases the probability of sharing sociodemographic attributes in such
   a way that it may be considered one of the causes of homophily,
   contributing to adolescents taking greater risks, such as consuming
   alcohol.},

Abstract = {Health in all policies is a key approach to promote health and calls for

   In this paper, we analyze how a network called `Healthy Region Plus' in

   levels. We aim to analyze the different roles of actors involved in the
   network based on the promoter model. We conducted two socio-material
   network mappings based on the Net-map approach by Schiffer and Hauck.
   The analysis followed three steps: data visualization, descriptive
   analysis of network properties, and interpretation of findings. Our
   findings reveal a complex intersectoral cooperation structure, with
   county and city level clusters, with network members who act as diverse
   power, expert, process, or relationship promoters. We also identified
   certain relevant sectors not to be part of the network. We discuss that
   the success of the network depends on the members' active participation
   in and their outreach beyond the existing network, between city and
   county levels, and across sectors to promote health and build

   and that a few clients and sex workers are highly connected whilst the
   majority only have one or few sexual contacts. Finally, our simulation
   models suggested that prevention strategies targeting both sex workers

   can be a powerful tool to understand how animal socioecology influences
   the spatiotemporal distribution of human-wildlife interactions. For 10
   groups of rhesus, long-tailed and bonnet macaques (Macaca spp.) living
   in anthropogenically impacted environments in Asia, we collected data on
   human-macaque interactions, animal demographics, and macaque-macaque
   agonistic and affiliative social interactions. We constructed `human
   co-interaction networks' based on associations between macaques that
   interacted with humans within the same time and spatial locations, and
   social networks based on macaque-macaque allogrooming behaviour,
   affiliative behaviours of short duration (agonistic support,
   lip-smacking, silent bare-teeth displays and non-sexual mounting) and
   proximity. Pre-network permutation tests revealed that, within all
   macaque groups, specific individuals jointly took risks by repeatedly,
   consistently co-interacting with humans within and across time and
   space. GLMMs revealed that macaques' tendencies to co-interact with
   humans was positively predicted by their tendencies to engage in
   short-duration affiliative interactions and tolerance of conspecifics,
   although the latter varied across species (bonnets>rhesus>long-tailed).
   Male macaques were more likely to co-interact with humans than females.
   Neither macaques' grooming relationships nor their dominance ranks
   predicted their tendencies to co-interact with humans. Our findings
   suggest that, in challenging anthropogenic environments, less (compared
   to more) time-consuming forms of affiliation, and additionally greater
   social tolerance in less ecologically flexible species with a shorter
   history of exposure to humans, may be key to animals' joint propensities
   to take risks to gain access to resources. For males, greater
   exploratory tendencies and less energetically demanding long-term
   life-history strategies (compared to females) may also influence such
   joint risk-taking. From conservation and public health perspectives,
   wildlife connectedness within such co-interaction networks may inform
   interventions to mitigate zoonosis, and move human-wildlife interactions
   from conflict towards coexistence.},

Title = {Social network analysis methods for exploring SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing
   data},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Background Contact tracing data of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus2(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is used to estimate basic
   epidemiological parameters. Contact tracing data could also be
   potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the
   individual patient level. Characterization of individuals based on
   different levels of infectiousness could better inform the contact
   tracing interventions at field levels. Methods Standard social network
   analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission
   dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed
   SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data
   set with diagnosed patients as ``nodes{''} and their epidemiological
   contact as ``edges{''} was created. Directed network perspective was
   utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a ``source
   patient{''} towards a ``target patient{''}. Network measures of ``degree
   centrality{''} and ``betweenness centrality{''} were calculated to
   identify influential patients in the transmission of infection.
   Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub-
   groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures
   and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. Results
   Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959
   patients, 11.27\% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to
   40.19\% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65\% (12)
   patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have
   collectively infected 37.61\% (296 of 787), secondary patients.
   Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50\% (93) patients
   had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the
   transmission between other patients. Network component analysis
   identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential
   patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95\% of total patients
   (1959) and 68.74\% of epidemiological contacts in the network.
   Conclusions Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact
   tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level
   variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified
   individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately
   contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools
   could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help
   improve the contact tracing activities.},

   Twitter},
Journal = {BIG DATA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In late March of 2020, a new hashtag, \#FilmYourHospital, made its first
   appearance on social media. The hashtag encouraged people to visit local
   hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help
   ``prove{''} that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using
   techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how
   this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag
   virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among
   Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users
   with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early
   days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far
   right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this
   hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their
   followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local
   hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the
   campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a
   secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the
   \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the
   ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially
   mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of
   information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims
   that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not
   science are much harder to root out.},

   Health Policies},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper
   suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on
   coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles
   founded on text-as-data information, open science, the dissemination of
   scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public
   health in the fight against the virus. Objective: The primary goal of
   this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify
   critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions.
   We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in
   implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of
   developing evidence-based public health policies. Methods: We used the
   EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access
   to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their
   associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a
   theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories:
   conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of
   our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques
   (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. Results:
   Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated
   the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to
   public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the
   United States and China were the primary contributors to global
   coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated
   that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a
   secondary position. University collaborations in this domain were strong
   between the United Conclusions: Our findings argue for a data-driven
   approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and
   relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policy
   makers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their
   decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for
   effective health responses.},

Title = {Hepatitis C virus-related policy-making in Iran: a stakeholder and
   social network analysis},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health
   challenge worldwide. Implementing policies to cope with this challenge
   requires commitment from all stakeholders at various levels, and all
   necessary resources should be mobilised. Support for various HCV-related
   stakeholders can reduce the challenges and obstacles that can be
   encountered during the programme implementation. The present study aims
   to identify all stakeholders involved with HCV-related policy-making in
   Iran at different steps (policy development, implementation and
   evaluation) and to characterise them in terms of interest, position,
   power and influence, in order to provide valuable information for
   appropriate decision-making and design. The present study can also serve
   as a case study for healthcare systems in other countries.
   Method: An approach based on social network analysis was utilised. Data
   collected included relevant document searches and in-depth interviews to
   a sample of 18 key informants.
   Results: Various stakeholders were found to be involved with HCV-related
   policies in Iran. The extent of their participation and support in
   policy-making varied. Specifically, international agencies had a high
   interest for HCV-related policy-making, whereas media and members of the
   private sector were characterised by a medium interest and governmental
   and non-governmental bodies by a highly variable interest, ranging from
   low to high, depending on the specific organism. Moreover, media and
   members of the private sector, non-governmental institutions and
   international agencies were rated low in terms of position, whereas
   governmental actors were rated low to high. Media were rated medium in
   terms of power, whereas international agencies and members of the
   private sector were respectively rated low to medium and low.
   Non-governmental actors were rated low, whilst governmental bodies were
   rated low to high. Finally, media, members of the private sector and
   international agencies were rated medium in terms of influence, whereas
   non-governmental and governmental actors were respectively rated low to
   medium and low to high.
   Conclusion: Policy-making involves trust, negotiation and integration of
   the different views of all stakeholders. Social network analysis was
   critical for identifying stakeholders and showing that, in Iran,
   involvement in HCV-related policy-making is generally low. This
   information is of practical implication for policy- and decision-makers
   regarding the adoption of more favourable and effective strategies.},

   post-disaster uncertainty among Syrian migrants using social network
   analysis with public health approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {ObjectivesOn February 6th, 2023, a doublet earthquake struck Turkiye,
   impacting more than 15 million people including migrants, and resulting
   in over 50,000 deaths. The Syrian migrants experience multiple
   uncertainties in their daily lives which are further compounded by
   multifaceted challenges of the post-disaster environment. Social media
   was used intensively and with impunity in this environment and thereby
   provides a window into the explicit and implicit dynamics of daily life
   after a disaster. We aimed to explore how a post-disaster environment
   potentially generates new uncertainties or exacerbating pre-existing
   ones for migrants through social media analysis with an indirect
   perspective, in the context of 2023-Earthquake in Turkiye and Syrian
   migrants. MethodsSocial network analysis was used to analyze
   Twitter-data with the hashtags `Syrian' and `earthquake' during a 10-day
   period beginning on March 22nd, 2023. We calculated network metrics,
   including degree-values and betweenness-centrality and clustered the
   network to understand groups. We analyzed a combination of 27 tweets
   with summative content analysis using a text analysis tool, to identify
   the most frequently used words. We identified the main points of each
   tweet and assessed these as possible contributors to post-disaster
   uncertainty among migrants by using inductive reasoning. ResultsThere
   were 1918 Twitter users, 274 tweets, 124 replies and 1726 mentions.
   Discussions about Syrian migrants and earthquakes were established
   across various groups (n(groups(edges > 15)) = 16). Certain users had a
   greater influence on the overall network. The nine most frequently used
   words were included under uncertainty-related category
   (n(most\_frequently\_used\_words) = 20); `aid, vote, house, citizen,
   Afghan, illegal, children, border, and leave'. Nine main points were
   identified as possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants.
   ConclusionThe post-disaster environment has the potential to exacerbate
   existing uncertainties, such as being an undocumented migrant, concerns
   about deportation and housing, being or having a child, inequality of
   rights between being a citizen and non-citizen, being in minority within
   minority, political climate of the host nation and access to education
   or to generate new ones such equitable distribution of aid, which can
   lead to poor health outcomes. Recognizing the possible post-disaster
   uncertainties among migrants and addressing probable underlying factors
   might help to build more resilient and healthy communities.},

Abstract = {The degree of relatedness and an interacting unifying central member can
   exacerbate disease transmission within a social group. The severity of
   the disease depends on the route, dose and frequency of infection.
   Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the
   spread of the disease. LionsPanthera leoare social carnivores with
   individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion
   behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals
   and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger
   National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine
   tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal
   disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed
   us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of
   interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three
   prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised
   degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between
   pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other,
   a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in
   dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so,
   within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear
   from a pride. Persistence of the disease as noted for lions in Kruger
   can only realize through unlikely transmissions or through feeding on
   infected prey. Our results support lions as a spill-over host.},

Abstract = {BackgroundQuality surveillance data used to build tuberculosis (TB)
   transmission models are frequently unavailable and may overlook
   community intrinsic dynamics that impact TB transmission. Social network
   analysis (SNA) generates data on hyperlocal social-demographic
   structures that contribute to disease transmission.MethodsWe collected
   social contact data in five villages and built SNA-informed
   village-specific stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar.
   A name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact
   networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by
   snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were
   aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and individual-level
   characteristics determining contact formation and structure were
   identified by fitting an exponential random graph model (ERGM), which
   formed the basis of the contact structure and model dynamics. Models
   were calibrated and used to evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and
   community resiliency to foreign TB introduction.ResultsInter- and
   intra-village SNA showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with
   transitivity (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43.
   Active case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active
   TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all
   village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and without
   specific interventions, networks A and B showed resilience to both
   active and latent TB reintroduction, while Network C, the village
   network with the highest transitivity, lacked resiliency to
   reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence of 2\% and a TB mortality
   rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one new contagious infection post
   hypothetical elimination.ConclusionIn remote Madagascar, SNA-informed
   models suggest that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease
   (active TB) prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB)
   burden remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction
   decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down{''}
   population level TB models would most likely miss this difference
   between small communities. SNA bridges large-scale population-based and

   not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with
   avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430
   birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through
   mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional
   methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium
   (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of
   mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across
   bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the
   source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases
   during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations
   between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as
   determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide
   polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly
   generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes
   clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were
   dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected
   birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant
   (p<0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but
   not for M. genavense. Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed
   genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by
   chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were
   identified for M. genavense, although data were sparse. Integrating the
   WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their
   host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of
   connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a
   contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters.},

Title = {Adolescent alcohol use: use of social network analysis and
   cross-classified multilevel modeling to examine peer group, school, and
   neighborhood-level influences},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Background: Neighborhood-, school-, and peer-contexts play an important
   role in adolescent alcohol use behaviors. Methodological advances permit
   simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and
   joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and
   studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include
   contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data;
   or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an
   eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual
   contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary
   parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta
   parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified
   models are also used to understand how each context may matter
   differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534
   females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and
   traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full
   and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups,
   schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%,
   respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do
   not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge
   as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in
   adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both
   methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model
   contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in
   youth alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention
   strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer
   networks.},

Title = {The journey to overdose: Using spatial social network analysis as a
   novel framework to study geographic discordance in overdose deaths},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {245},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose deaths are often geographically discordant
   (the community in which the overdose death occurs is different from the
   community of residence). Thus, in many cases there is a journey to
   overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine
   characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 \%
   of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study.
   First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs
   (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant
   overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which
   journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and
   characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used
   temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent,
   sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we
   identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus
   non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower
   housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated
   relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more
   likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be
   authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved
   fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be
   accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other
   than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of
   suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to
   overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in
   metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe continued rise in fatalities from opioid analgesics
   despite a steady decline in the number of individual prescriptions
   directing >= 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day may be
   explained by patient exposures to redundant prescriptions from multiple
   prescribers.ObjectivesWe evaluated prescribers' specialty and social
   network characteristics associated with high-risk opioid exposures
   resulting from single-prescriber high-daily dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.DesignRetrospective cohort
   study.ParticipantsA cohort of prescribers with opioid analgesic
   prescription claims for non-cancer chronic opioid users in an Illinois
   Medicaid managed care program in 2015-2016.Main MeasuresPer prescriber
   rates of single-prescriber high-daily-dose prescriptions or
   multi-prescriber discoordination.Key ResultsFor 2280 beneficiaries,
   36,798 opioid prescription claims were submitted by 3532 prescribers.
   Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\%
   of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted
   for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions
   (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following
   specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared
   to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence
   interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and
   surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis
   identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume
   pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of
   predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians.
   Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected
   sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk
   exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's
   periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing
   than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing
   discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated
   practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and
   integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to
   specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential
   policy implications.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Earthquake is a natural disaster severely affecting
   the societies' health, hygiene, and welfare as such the most effective
   method to respond to its damages is to develop a readiness plan. This
   study aimed to discover thematic patterns and co-author relationships

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study adopted the
   scientometric approach and used word co-occurrence and social network
   analysis. The published articles indexed in PubMed were retrieved from
   1970 to 2021 using a combination of keywords ``earthquake and response.
   `` The data were analyzed in VOSviewer, UCINET, and NetDraw software.
   RESULTS: The following six thematic clusters with a social map were
   extracted: Initial response of the healthcare system, response to
   probabilistic risks after the hazard, response to mental health and
   community resilience, response to public health, response to
   post-traumatic stress disorders, and staff's response to the needs
   assessment and continuity of diagnostic treatment services. Moreover,
   social network analysis revealed the great impact of Japanese and
   Chinese authors and institutes. CONCLUSION: The present study detected
   many gaps in the literature on earthquake response, which can contribute
   to developing a general framework to prepare integrated healthcare
   earthquake response plans to promote the performance of this system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {11-12},
Pages = {5209-5228},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Homeless youth experience all types of violence at higher rates than
   their housed counterparts. This is typically the result of many
   contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma,
   subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while
   living on the streets. Reducing violence in the lives of homeless youth
   is imperative and can contribute to a young person's ability to safely
   and successfully exit the streets and lead a long and productive life in
   society. However, developing public health and social interventions to
   reduce violence in adolescent and young adult populations is difficult
   due to the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of this
   phenomenon. Los Angeles area homeless youth (N = 366) were asked
   questions regarding recent violence experiences, emotion regulation, and
   their social network. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the
   overall effect of emotion regulation on violence, controlling for age,
   gender, race, sexual identity, experience of childhood abuse, and data
   collection site. In this sample, 56\% of youth endorsed fighting in the
   previous year, and those who reported more difficulties with emotion
   regulation were significantly more likely to fight. In addition, youth
   who scored below the mean on difficulties with regulation and belonged
   to networks characterized by low-difficulty peers were 60\% less likely
   to report fighting. Emotion regulation skills represent a malleable
   target for intervention that may contribute to reduced propensity for
   violence in this population. Implications for network-based
   interventions to improve individual emotion regulation and reduce
   overall violence among homeless youth and other at-risk populations are
   discussed.},

Title = {Spatial network and driving factors of low-carbon patent applications in
   China from a public health perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe natural disasters and climate anomalies caused by
   increasing global carbon emissions have seriously threatened public
   health. To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems,
   the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of
   peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. The low-carbon patent
   application is an important means to achieve these goals and promote
   public health. MethodsThis study analyzes the basic situation, spatial
   network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in
   China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using
   social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent
   database. ResultsThe following findings are established. (1) From the
   number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon
   patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of
   applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central
   and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing.
   (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed
   a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the
   eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The
   weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon
   patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including
   economic development, financial support, local scientific research
   level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level,
   the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with
   the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic
   development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology
   import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated
   with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban
   agglomerations. DiscussionThis study provides ideas for the construction
   and governance of low-carbon technology innovation system and
   perspectives for theoretical research on public health and high-quality
   development in China.},

Abstract = {PurposeWe aimed to synthesize insights from systems science approaches
   applied to domestic and gender-based violence.MethodsWe conducted a
   systematic review of systems science studies (systems thinking, group
   model-building, agent-based modeling {[}ABM], system dynamics {[}SD]
   modeling, social network analysis {[}SNA], and network analysis {[}NA])
   applied to domestic or gender-based violence, including victimization,
   perpetration, prevention, and community responses. We used blinded
   review to identify papers meeting our inclusion criteria (i.e.,
   peer-reviewed journal article or published book chapter that described a
   systems science approach to domestic or gender-based violence, broadly
   defined) and assessed the quality and transparency of each
   study.ResultsOur search yielded 1,841 studies, and 74 studies met our
   inclusion criteria (45 SNA, 12 NA, 8 ABM, and 3 SD). Although research
   aims varied across study types, the included studies highlighted social
   network influences on risks for domestic violence, clustering of risk
   factors and violence experiences, and potential targets for
   intervention. We assessed the quality of the included studies as
   moderate, though only a minority adhered to best practices in model
   development and dissemination, including stakeholder engagement and
   sharing of model code.ConclusionsSystems science approaches for the
   study of domestic and gender-based violence have shed light on the
   complex processes that characterize domestic violence and its broader
   context. Future research in this area should include greater dialogue
   between different types of systems science approaches, consideration of
   peer and family influences in the same models, and expanded use of best
   practices, including continued engagement of community stakeholders.},

Journal = {INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction. A subject directory plays an important role in a Web
   portal and it helps users effectively navigate the portal. This study
   examines a subject directory system related to Mental Health in the
   MedlinePlus portal and provides suggestions of optimisation to enhance
   the subject directory system.
   Method. A mixed research method combining social network analysis and
   inferential statistics was applied.
   Analysis. A structural and a semantic social network were built
   regarding the selected health topics related to mental health in the
   MedlinePlus portal. The two networks were compared and the outcomes were
   evaluated by domain experts.
   Results. Among the ninety-nine collected health topics related to mental
   health, three themes were identified through the visualisation analysis
   regarding grouped health topics. Patterns and characteristics of each
   theme group were discussed. As a result, fifty-five bidirectional and
   twenty-three unidirectional edges were identified and recommended to be
   added to the corresponding health topic pages. The recommended results
   indicate that the subject directory of specific mental health related
   topics is well constructed, while health consumer groups related topics
   might need more improvements. The optimised subject directory has
   significantly stronger semantic connection, and the results of the
   recommendations are consistent with the evaluation outcome of two domain
   experts.
   Conclusions. The findings of this study can provide ideas of optimising
   and enhancing the subject directory system to the public health portal
   creators and health professionals, and benefit health consumers for
   seeking health information online. The methodologies applied in this
   study may provide a novel way to investigate and enhance subject
   directories in general.},

Abstract = {Background: Stakeholder participation optimizes health planning,
   fostering the acceptability and integration of new health services.
   Collaborative approaches may help overcome existing challenges in the
   development, implementation and evaluation of community pharmacy
   services (CPSs). Stakeholder analyses lay the foundation for building
   collaboration in the integrated delivery of health care.
   Objectives: This stakeholder analysis was performed to organize a
   collaborative initiative to develop a CPS aimed at preventing
   cardiovascular diseases in Andalucia (Spain). It aimed to identify
   stakeholders, differentiate/categorize them, and analyze stakeholder
   relationships.
   Method: Stakeholders were identified using the snowballing technique. To
   differentiate/categorize stakeholders and analyze the relationships
   (i.e., collaboration) an online web-based questionnaire was sent to 186
   stakeholders. Stakeholders were asked for: (1) their influence, interest
   and attitude toward the initiative; (2) stakes/interests; (3) capacity
   to contribute to the initiative; (4) desire for involvement; (5)
   concerns; (6) whom they considered a key stakeholder; and (7) the level
   of collaboration they had with other stakeholders. Data analysis
   combined descriptive qualitative content analysis, descriptive
   quantitative analysis and social network analysis.
   Results: Of the 186 stakeholders approached, 96 (51.6\%) participated.
   The identification process yielded 217 stakeholders (individuals,
   organizations or collectives), classified into 10 groups. Fifty-seven
   stakeholders were considered critical to the intended initiative. Most
   participant stakeholders supported the initiative and were willing to
   collaborate in the development of the CPS. Public health and science
   were the main driving interests. A collaboration network existed between
   the 96 stakeholders.
   Conclusion: This study revealed the magnitude of the social system
   surrounding the development of a CPS aimed at preventing cardiovascular
   disease. A large array of stakeholders was identified and analyzed, and
   a group of critical stakeholders selected. Stakeholder characteristics
   such as attitude toward the initiative, potential contribution, desire
   for involvement, and the existing collaboration network, provided
   complementary information that was helpful for planning the process and
   stakeholder engagement.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1420-1425},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Despite increased awareness of infection control
   precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still
   spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial
   burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for
   contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic
   case-control study and to validate health care network changes during
   pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on
   hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with
   matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1
   year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links
   joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over
   time.
   Results: Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths
   of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care
   providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in
   the outbreak by more than 50\%. A timed animation of the network at one
   campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many
   roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.

Abstract = {Developing emergency drugs in time is key to responding to public health
   emergencies such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   This research constructs patent assignee citation networks based on
   COVID-19 drug patents and applies technology life cycle analysis and
   social network analysis to examine these networks. The results reveal
   the evolution and structure of the emergency drug innovation network and
   identify innovation entities with different research and development
   (R\&D) capabilities or a foundation for cooperation. This study attempts
   to provide the basis for theories and policies to accelerate R\&D of
   emergency drugs. The key results are as follows: (1) Technologies of the
   emergency drug innovation network show fluctuating growth aligned
   closely with public health emergencies. (2) The network presents a
   sparse structure with many active factions, whose members have the
   advantage of cooperating. (3) Three types of innovation entities are
   identified: the main technology suppliers, potential suppliers of other
   supporting technologies, and peripheral suppliers of other supporting
   technologies.},

Abstract = {This study examined the global media citation network of
   COVID-19-related news at two stages of the pandemic alert phase, i.e.,
   the national level alert stage and the global level alert stage. The
   findings reveal that the small-world pattern and scale-free property of
   media citation networks contributed to the rapid spread of
   COVID-19-related news around the world. Within the networks, a small
   number of media outlets from a few countries formed the backbone of the
   network to control the risk communication; meanwhile, many media of
   geographical and cultural similarities formed cross-border collaborative
   cliques in the periphery of the network. When the alert phase escalated
   from the national level to the global level, the network demonstrated a
   number of changes. The findings contribute to the understanding of risk
   communication for international public health emergencies by taking into
   account the network perspective and evolutionary nature of public health
   emergencies in analysis.},

Journal = {MICROBIAL GENOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aggregation of children in schools has been established to be a key
   driver of transmission of infectious diseases. Mathematical models of
   transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as
   vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data.
   However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen
   transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used
   Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within
   two secondary schools in England and test for associations between
   self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain
   collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact
   survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through
   self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates
   from the local community were also sequenced to assess the
   representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked
   transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and
   social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools
   is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found
   no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission,
   increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age
   children may be an important source of community transmission.},

   Networks: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {79143-79168},
Abstract = {Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social
   network analysis, recommender systems and epidemiology. Representing
   complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models
   to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as
   dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of
   inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile,
   graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent
   years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science
   tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the
   popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic
   network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for
   dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that
   this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph
   neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to
   address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a
   foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and
   notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph
   neural network models using the proposed terminology.},

Abstract = {Purpose The health equity and prosperity of communities is closely
   linked to the effectiveness and success of local health coalitions.
   Social network analysis (SNA) is one mechanism to quantify and
   understand the factors leading to collaboration and effectiveness within
   these coalitions. This study aims to investigate network characteristics
   associated with perceived success and satisfaction in a health coalition
   and determine significant factors related to organizational
   collaborations. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the
   Olympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition (OPHCC) which aims to
   prevent chronic disease in rural Clallam County, Washington.
   Representatives (n = 21) from member organizations (n = 18) were asked
   to report on organization characteristics, perceived satisfaction in
   coalition activities, perceived success toward coalition's mission, and
   collaborations with other organizations in the coalition. Multilevel
   modeling used to analyze whether an organization's position within the
   coalition network was associated with their perceived satisfaction and
   perceived success. Exponential random graph modeling was used to examine
   what factors may impact collaboration ties between coalition members.
   Findings Organization representatives reported a total of 252
   collaboration ties. In multilevel models, organization characteristics
   and network centrality scores accounted for between 61 and 68\% of
   variance displayed in satisfaction scores and 45-61\% of variance in
   perceived success scores. Exponential random graph modeling revealed
   activity level, for-profit status, and transitivity as significant
   factors in collaborative tie presence. Originality/value Encouraging
   consistent active participation, a balance of organizational type, and
   projects which require more than two collaborators may provide an
   environment for collaborative ties between organizations.},

Title = {Using systems science methods to enhance the work of national and local
   walking partnerships: practical insights from Ireland},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {i8-i13},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Background Physical activity (PA) literature is dominated by
   individual-level descriptive studies, which are known to have limited
   impact on population PA levels. Leveraging systems science methods
   offers opportunities to approach PA in a manner which embraces its
   inherent complexity. This study describes how participatory systems
   mapping and social network analysis (SNA) were used to understand the
   work of local and national level walking systems in Ireland. Methods Two
   adapted participatory action research workshops with multisectoral
   stakeholders were used to develop a systems map for walking in Cork,
   Ireland. The Global Action Plan for Physical Activity 2018-2030 (GAPPA)
   map was used as a framework to categorize workshop outcomes. Secondly,
   SNA methods were used to analyse the communication network between
   partners of Get Ireland Walking, a national walking promotion
   initiative, as defined within their strategic plan and the actual
   communication network as experienced by the partners. Results The
   systems mapping process allowed stakeholders to identify 19 suggested
   actions for the Cork walking system. The SNA found that there were
   considerably fewer communication ties between partners in the actual
   communication network than in the strategy defined network. Conclusion
   The systems mapping process was a useful catalyst for engaging
   stakeholders in cross-sectoral communication and the GAPPA was a
   practical way to organize workshop outcomes. Social network analysis
   methods highlighted that the communication network of a national level
   walking promotion partnership is not working as planned. Overall, the
   use of systems science methods can provide practical insights for local
   and national level walking systems.},

   transversal study of centrality with a social network analysis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Objectives To analyse the physical activity carried out by the
   adolescents in the study, its relationship to being overweight
   (overweight+obese) and to analyse the structure of the social network of
   friendship established in adolescents doing group sports, using
   different parameters indicative of centrality. Setting It was carried
   out in an educational environment, in 11 classrooms belonging to 5
   Schools in Ponferrada (Spain). Participants 235 adolescents were
   included in the study (49.4\% female), who were classified as normal
   weight or overweight. Primary and secondary outcome measures Physical
   Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used to study the
   level of physical activity. A social network analysis was carried out to
   analyse structural variables of centrality in different degrees of
   contact. Results 30.2\% of the participants in our study were
   overweight. Relative to female participants in this study, males
   obtained significantly higher scores in the PAQ-A (OR: 2.11; 95\% CI:
   1.04 to 4.25; p value: 0.036) and were more likely to participate in
   group sport (OR: 4.59; 95\% CI: 2.28 to 9.22; p value: 0.000). We found
   no significant relationship between physical activity and the weight
   status in the total sample, but among female participants, those with
   overweight status had higher odds of reporting high levels of physical
   exercise (OR: 4.50; 95\% CI: 1.21 to 16.74; p value: 0.025). In terms of
   centrality, differentiating by gender, women who participated in group
   sports were more likely to be classified as having low values of
   centrality, while the opposite effect occurred for men, more likely to
   be classified as having high values of centrality. Conclusions Our
   findings, with limitations, underline the importance of two fundamental
   aspects to be taken into account in the design of future strategies:
   gender and the centrality within the social network depending on the
   intensity of contact they have with their peers.},

Title = {Understanding the Diffusion of Theoretical Knowledge in Nursing: A
   Citation Analysis of Meleis's Transition Theory},
Journal = {FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE JOURNAL OF NURSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-283},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the structure of the knowledge
   creation process in nursing science and to investigate the dissemination
   of theoretical knowledge in other disciplines by analyzing citations and
   social network data.
   Method: This exploratory study evaluated Metadata to find academic
   publications. Meleis's Transition Theory was selected as a case study. A
   majority of the publications that represented the transition theory were
   assigned as the core of the theory. Forward and backward citations were
   used as agents of knowledge linkage to determine the dissemination of
   the theory in the field of science. Social network analysis and
   visualization were used to depict graphical and structural relations of
   the research front and the knowledge base.
   Results: The knowledge base of the Transition Theory was built on 7
   different information networks. The most effective and vast information
   network consisted of Meleis, AI as a researcher and the central
   information network, which is the journal of Nursing Research. Oncology,
   geriatrics, public health, and psychology in the areas of information
   propagation within the field of nursing were considered as research
   areas where the theoretical framework provided by the theory was
   rendered functional.
   Conclusion: In recent years, the use of theoretical frameworks has
   become a necessity to assess the changing needs of the study of nursing
   science. The method used in the study can be effectively used to analyze
   the conceptual structures in the nursing education and professional
   application processes and to understand the origins of these theories.
   Further research can help to structure the use of informational
   science-based research designs to understand the connections between
   theory, clinical practice, and the development of educational contents
   in nursing faculties.},

Abstract = {The literature has provided multiple metrics to measure the structural
   position of a node in a network or its structural social capital.
   However, the dynamics of social capital is rarely addressed. In this
   article, we analyze the sustainability of the structural position of the

   inbound and outbound similarity measures to address the structural
   hole's sustainability. To evaluate our approach, we use four real
   dynamic graphs and Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered (SIR) model of
   epidemiology and regression analysis. We evaluate the power of our
   measures in predicting the evolution of the information spread of nodes,
   and compare the results with the measures from the literature. Our
   results confirm the relevance of neighborhood similarity for addressing
   the sustainability of social capital over time. In particular, the
   notions of inbound and outbound similarity proposed in this article show
   its relevance. The proposed framework allows better evaluation of one's

   Cross-Sectional Analysis},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is the second-leading cause of mortality in the
   world and ranks fifth in terms of causes of death in the United States.
   ``Time is brain{''} when it comes to the detection and treatment of a
   stroke as it can reduce morbidity and disability in the long run. May is
   recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned
   stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the
   risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the
   first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to
   formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke
   awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May
   from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke
   awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR
   \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network
   analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts.
   Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of
   relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact,
   reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags,
   influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage,
   Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke
   awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an
   overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the
   total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the
   tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard
   deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have
   been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top
   users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the
   event had primary involvement from the United States and the United
   Kingdom. The event had very limited reach in other continents,
   especially in Asian and African countries.Conclusion: Our estimates
   highlight the limited digital impact of Stroke Awareness Month globally.
   The use of social media should be promoted, particularly in developing
   countries, to provide reliable information and generate user involvement
   on a global scale. Findings from this study can be leveraged to inform
   future policies for stroke awareness campaigns that improve public and
   global health.},

Title = {Global Trends in Scientific Research on Pediatric Obesity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {(1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific
   production, collaboration among countries, and research topics focusing
   on pediatric obesity. (2) Methods: The papers that were included in the
   study were retrieved from theWeb of Science Core Collection from
   Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis of several focuses,
   including journals of publication, subject categories, most frequent
   author keywords, and journal impact factors, was conducted. Social
   network analysis was used to recognize collaboration groups between
   countries and the co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A
   total of 12,171 research articles were published in 2036 journals
   classified under a variety of subject areas, with pediatrics (27.7\%),
   nutrition and dietetics (18.5\%), and public environmental and
   occupational health (18.4\%) accounting for the most frequent study
   areas, and Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity
   (299), and BMC Public Health being the most productive journals. The
   main challenges identified for pediatric obesity include general topics
   such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, and prevention as well as
   other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, insulin
   resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4)
   Conclusions: We observed a growth rate in the number of published
   articles of 59.8\%, which serves as evidence of the importance of the
   topic. The number of funded papers also doubled from 2010 to 2019. There
   has been significant global collaboration on the topic, with countries
   across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic
   analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics
   along with specialized health terms and terms related to public health.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to identify individual-level factors and

   health venue referral networks. A sample of 543 HIV-seronegative YMSM
   aged 16-29 were recruited in 2014-2016 in Chicago, IL, and Houston, TX.
   Stochastic social network models were estimated to model PrEP uptake.
   PrEP uptake was associated with more utilization of health venues in
   Houston and higher levels of sexual risk behavior in Chicago. In
   Houston, both Hispanic and Black YMSM compared to White YMSM were less
   likely to take PrEP. No evidence was found to support the spread of PrEP
   uptake via referral networks, which highlights the need for more
   effective PrEP referral network systems to scale up PrEP implementation

Title = {Knowledge Mapping of Dietary Factors of Metabolic Syndrome Research:
   Hotspots, Knowledge Structure, and Theme Trends},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: The global incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is
   continuously increasing, making it a potential worldwide public health
   concern. Research on dietary factors related to MetS has attracted
   considerable attention in the recent decades. However, the research
   hotspots, knowledge structure, and theme trends for the dietary factors
   associated with MetS remain unknown, and have not yet been
   systematically mapped. This study aimed to review the research status of
   diet as a risk factor for MetS through bibliometric methods.
   Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science database.
   Research hotspots were identified using biclustering analysis with the
   gCLUTO software, and knowledge structure was explored via social network
   analysis using the Ucinet software. Theme trends were investigated using
   evolutionary analysis with the SciMAT software. In total, 1,305 papers
   were analyzed. The research output on the dietary factors associated
   with MetS increased steadily. The research scope was gradually expanding
   and diverse. Overall, eight research hot spots, four key dietary nodes,
   and four motor themes on the dietary factors associated with MetS were
   identified. Fatty acids, dietary fiber, and polyphenols have been the
   focus of research in this field over the years. Evolutionary analysis
   showed that fish oil and vitamin C were well-developed research foci
   recently. Prebiotics was recognized as an emerging theme with certain
   developmental potential. These findings provide a better understanding
   of the research status of the dietary factors associated with MetS and a
   reference for future investigations.},

Title = {How are Anti-Air Pollution Policies Implemented? A Network Analysis of
   Campaign-Style Enforcement in China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Haze pollution has become one of the most important environment problems
   in China, raising increasing serious public health concerns. When
   carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's
   anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of
   government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain
   period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious
   haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a
   social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme
   of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with
   enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement
   network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's
   structure, and the centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the
   goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a
   larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure
   of the enforcement network became flatter, with a horizontal' management
   arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to
   the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the
   campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward
   the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results
   reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more
   specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network
   structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to
   local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those
   departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides
   managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors
   involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy
   implementation.},

Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {35-44},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intersectoral collaboration amongst health and other sectors, as well as
   between government and non-governmental organisations, has been
   highlighted as a way to improve health equity. We used a mixed-methods
   approach to assess collaborative relationships between multiple
   government sectors and civil society and to suggest possible health
   promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the urban poor in
   deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in health
   promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city
   area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods.
   Participants included stakeholders working for or engaging in
   governments (3), public health care institutions (5), social service
   providers (3), community-based organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based
   organisations (3). We conducted semi-structured, one-on-one interviews
   and then collected survey data. Quantitative data were analysed using
   social network analysis, and qualitative data were analysed through
   iterative and consensus processes. The social network analysis indicated
   that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and controlling
   informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis showed
   that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of
   collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to
   challenges to intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and
   communication, (2) need of a coalition with a committed leading actor
   for future collaboration and (3) organisational and political silos
   within and across public sectors. Increased understanding of the current
   status of and challenges to collaboration can inform the planning and
   implementation of complex intervening strategies and policies tailored
   to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods. Community-led
   collaborative actions empower people in marginalised communities to
   envision a healthier community.},

   network analysis: a systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 30},
Abstract = {Background Social network analysis (SNA) is often used to examine how
   social relationships influence adolescent health behaviours, but no
   study has documented the range of network measures used to do so. We
   aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health
   behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network
   measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA.
   Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts
   commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the
   network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer
   behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms.
   Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all
   distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included
   articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The
   categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201,
   100\%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6\%) and popularity
   (n=110, 54.7\%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for
   `similarity on popularity' (within the `similarity' category) to 28 for
   the `characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and
   nominated peers' (within the `nature of the relationships' category).
   Using the examples of `social isolation', `group membership',
   `individuals in a central position' (within the `position within the
   network' category) and `nominations of influential peers' (sub within
   the `popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting
   and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust
   methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures
   in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public
   health intervention based on SNA.},

Title = {Cross-sector co-creation of a community-based physical activity program
   for breast cancer survivors in Colombia},
Journal = {HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Benefits of physical activity (PA) in breast cancer survivors (BCS) are
   well established. However, programs to promote PA among BCS tailored to
   real-world contexts within low- to middle-income countries are limited.
   Cross-sector co-creation can be key to effective and scalable programs
   for BCS in these countries. This study aimed to evaluate the networking
   process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation of a PA
   program for Colombian BCS called My Body. We employed a mixed-methods
   design including semistructured interviews, workshops and a social
   network analysis of centrality measures to assess stakeholders'
   engagement, resources and skills enabling the collaborative work,
   challenges, outcomes and lessons learned. The descriptive analysis and
   the centrality measures of the network revealed that 19 cross-sector
   stakeholders engaged in the My Body collaborative network. Through
   ongoing communication and cooperation, My Body built relationships
   between the academic lead institutions (local and international), and
   local and national public, private and academic institutions working in
   public health, sports and recreation, social sciences and engineering
   fields. The outcomes included the co-creation of the community-based PA
   program for BCS, its implementation through cross-sector synergies,
   increased relationships and communications among stakeholders, and
   successful dissemination of evidence and project results to the
   collaboration partners and other relevant stakeholders and community
   members. The mixed-methods assessment enabled understanding of ways to
   advance cross-sector co-creation of health promotion programs. The
   findings can help to enable continued development of sustainable
   cross-sector co-creation processes aimed at advancing PA promotion.
   Lay Summary Collaborative work among stakeholders and researchers from
   different governmental sectors and disciplinary fields can be key to
   design and implement effective and scalable programs to promote physical
   activity (PA) among breast cancer survivors (BCS). This might be
   particularly critical in low- to middle-income countries where the
   implementation of evidence-based health-promoting programs tailored to
   real-world contexts are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the
   networking process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation
   of a PA program for Colombian BCS. We employed qualitative methods and
   social network analyses to assess stakeholders' engagement, resources
   and skills enabling the collaborative work, challenges, outcomes and
   lessons learned. The co-creation of the program improved synergies
   between research, policy and practice. Communication through several
   channels including e-mail and workshops was the key resource to advance
   the collaborative work. Stakeholders underscored that cross-sector
   networking allowed allocating resources and achieving shared goals.
   Sustainable cross-sector collaborative processes are key for health
   promotion.},

Abstract = {Objective: The public health system faces major challenges in 2020,
   including an aging workforce, reductions in funding, and 2 simultaneous
   major threats to public health-the coronavirus pandemic and racial
   injustice. To effectively harness promising new technologies and address
   these and other public health challenges ahead, public health
   professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting
   and improving public health. This project sought to understand the
   network of health departments and organizations that provide training in
   order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve
   access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby
   strengthening the public health system. Design/Setting/Participants: We
   conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting
   Region V of the Department of Health \& Human Services. The survey
   focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national
   organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social
   network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics
   to examine the network. Results: Of 290 participating health departments
   (58\% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at
   least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248
   LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10
   national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected
   to the state health department for training than to any other
   organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national
   membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local
   health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with
   its number of training connections. Conclusions: State health
   departments may benefit from the support of universities, national
   nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer
   training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs.
   Additional qualitative information from local and state health
   departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for
   universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations
   to participate in training local practitioners to improve LHD capacity.},

Title = {ORIGINAL RESEARCH An Emergent Network for the Diffusion of Innovations
   Among Local Health Departments at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for
   accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health
   departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could
   prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to
   determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an
   informal network to share information and advice about innovative
   community health practices, programs, and policies.
   Methods
   In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303
   senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of
   advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices
   informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based
   practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a
   social network analysis program to assess answers.
   Results
   A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate
   nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by
   peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24
   acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together
   (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we
   surveyed performed neither of these roles.
   Conclusion
   Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed
   to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and
   adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new
   public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results
   useful both for emergencies and for practice-as usual.},

Journal = {COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {2023 FEB},
Abstract = {Existing methods in social {[}oral] epidemiology primarily utilize
   statistical models that assume static characteristics of individuals and
   environments. While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the
   social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and
   progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture
   complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments
   respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a
   variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent
   consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social
   Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial
   health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple
   levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new
   and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite
   of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative
   mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral
   health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic
   interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study
   and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients,
   healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any
   differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future
   longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively.
   This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of
   complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex
   systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics
   models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges
   faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods
   into the population oral health sciences.},

   analyzed using the package bibliometrix for open-source software R and
   the NIH-developed research tool iCite. Results: The research team and
   their collaborators (n = 485) produced 157 grant-citing publications
   from 2015-2020. The science was produced by small research teams
   clustered around three main communities of topics: Alzheimer's Disease,
   brain imaging, and neuropsychological testing in the elderly. Using the
   relative citation ratio, the publications produced by the research team
   were found to be influential when compared to other R01-funded
   publications. Conclusion: Recent developments in bibliometric analysis
   expand beyond traditional measurement capabilities to better understand
   the characteristics, outcomes, and influences of research teams. These
   findings can be used to inform researchers and institutions about
   research team composition, productivity, and success. Measures of
   research influence may be used to justify return on investment to
   funders.},

Title = {Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in
   China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media
   is vital for rumor control and disease containment during public health
   crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a
   certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination
   networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction
   behaviors.
   Objective: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of
   rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect
   on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a
   Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19
   epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information
   characteristics of user interaction content.
   Methods: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl
   rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23,
   2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment
   analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first
   analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on
   the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on
   others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude
   distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions
   between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels,
   we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction
   content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking
   and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect.
   Results: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an
   essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism
   played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might
   not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and
   verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting
   interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment,
   information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online
   users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and
   information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment,
   which was often accompanied by incivility.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo
   chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction
   mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content.
   Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing
   or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.},

Abstract = {The analysis of domestic pig movements has become useful to understand
   the disease spread patterns and epidemiology, which facilitates the
   development of more effective animal diseases control strategies. The
   aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics
   of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the
   contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine
   fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the
   National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network
   analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered
   premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also
   created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises
   movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average
   diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path
   length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world
   structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55\%).
   Backyard producers made up 89\% of the network premises, and the top 2\%
   of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50\% of the movements. The
   highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of
   the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was
   in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF)
   disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of
   network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented
   the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and
   parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to
   improve its procedures and update the disease control and management
   policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based
   surveillance.},

Abstract = {The use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana among adolescents are major
   public health concerns, and a number of epidemiological studies have
   been conducted to understand the drivers of these individual health
   behaviours. However, there is no literature that jointly models these
   health behaviours with the aim of understanding the relative importance
   of individual factors, friendship effects and spatial effects in
   determining the prevalence of alcohol, cigarette and marijuana use among
   adolescents. To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel
   multivariate spatio-network model for jointly modelling all three of
   these behaviours, with inference conducted in a Bayesian setting using
   Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model is motivated by survey
   data from five schools in Los Angeles, California, and the results
   indicate the important roles that individual factors and friendship
   networks play in driving the uptake of these health behaviours.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPulmonary embolism (PE) is a popular area of research in the
   field of respiratory medicine. We performed a bibliometric analysis
   based on PubMed database to characterize the distribution pattern of
   literature and knowledge structures related to PE. MethodsLiterature
   pertaining to PE from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, was
   retrieved from the PubMed database. Bibliographic information was
   generated using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder
   (BICOMB). The visualization matrix was established using gCLUTO
   software. Strategic diagram analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
   9 software. Social network analysis (SNA) was generated using Ucinet6.0
   and NetDraw 2.084 software. ResultsOut of all the retrieved MeSH terms
   and subheadings, 52 MeSH terms/MeSH subheadings with a high frequency
   were found, and hot subjects were sorted into 6 clusters. The strategy
   diagram showed that the epidemiology, etiology, and drug therapy of PE
   were well advanced. In contrast, studies on diagnostic imaging,
   pathology, and complications of PE were still immature and offered
   potential research space. Social network analysis showed that marginal
   topics such as surgical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, prevention
   and control of postoperative complications, and metabolism and analysis
   of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were emerging research
   hotspots. ConclusionObjective analysis of the research developments in
   the field of PE can provide intuitive knowledge structure for
   researchers and clinicians. Analysis of the research hotspots related to
   PE is helpful for researchers and clinicians by highlighting future
   research directions.},

Abstract = {Suicide is a crucial public health concern for American Indian and
   Alaska native (AIAN) communities. AIANs have the highest suicide rate
   compared to all other ethnic groups in the United States. Social
   relations are a salient fixture of AIAN culture. The primary aims of
   this study were to describe the personal networks of AI youth that have
   recently had a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation and to identify key
   network differences between the two groups. This study uses personal
   networks collected among AIs living on a reservation in the Southwest.
   Our sample included 46 American Indians that have recently attempted
   suicide or had suicidal ideation. We explored social network
   characteristics of the two groups descriptively as well as comparatively
   (t-tests). Our findings suggest that AI youth that have attempted
   suicide nominate more friends in their networks that have used alcohol
   and drugs compared to the networks of AI youth that have recent suicide
   ideation. Additionally, AI youth that recently attempted suicide have
   used alcohol and drugs with their network peers at a higher rate than
   youth that have had recent suicide ideation. Lastly, AI youth that have
   attempted suicide recently were significantly more likely to have more
   nominated friends in their networks that they had reached out to when
   they were struggling with suicide compared to their peers that have
   experienced recent suicide ideation. These results indicate a promising
   method moving forward to identify unique intervention strategies that
   extend beyond the individual.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives To examine the characteristics of pharmaceutical payments to
   healthcare and patient organisations in the four UK countries. Compare
   companies spending the most; types of organisations receiving payments
   and types of payments in the four countries. Measure the extent to which
   companies target payments at the same recipients in each country and
   whether it differs depending on the type of recipient.
   Design Cross-sectional comparative and social network analysis.
   Setting England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.
   Participants 100 donors (pharmaceutical companies) reporting payments to
   4229 recipients (healthcare organisations and patient organisations) in
   2015.
   Main outcome measures For each country: payment totals and distribution;
   average number of common recipients between companies; share of payments
   to organisations fulfilling different roles in the health ecosystem and
   payments for different activities.
   Results Companies prioritised different types of recipient and different
   types of activity in each country. There were significant differences in
   the distribution of payments across the four countries, even for similar
   types of recipients. Recipients in England and Wales received smaller
   individual payments than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Overall,
   targeting shared recipients occurred most frequently in England, but was
   also common in certain pockets of each country's health ecosystem. We
   found evidence of reporting errors in Disclosure UK.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest a strategic approach to payments
   tailored to countries' policy and decision-making context, indicating
   there may be specific vulnerabilities to financial conflicts of interest
   at subnational level. Payment differences between countries may be
   occurring in other countries, particularly those with decentralised
   health systems and/or high levels of independence across its
   decision-making authorities. We call for a single database containing
   all recipient types, full location details and published with associated
   descriptive and network statistics.},

Title = {Using systems thinking methodologies to address health care complexities
   and evidence implementation},
Journal = {JBI EVIDENCE IMPLEMENTATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-9},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Despite health care advances, artificial intelligence and
   government interventions aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of
   citizens, huge disparities and failures in care provision exist. This is
   demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in
   readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health
   systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural
   disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the
   health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service,
   funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and
   carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple
   providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use
   of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as
   those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A
   description of the system thinking methodology and its associated
   methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft
   system methodology are described with examples in the health care
   setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that
   have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of
   implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the
   Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However,
   many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most
   effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and
   champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a
   modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an
   appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a
   result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems
   thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex
   health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex
   problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care.
   Conclusion: It is important that methods to implement systems thinking
   methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.},

Title = {Linking parasitism to network centrality and the impact of sampling bias
   in its interpretation},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Group living is beneficial for individuals, but also comes with costs.
   One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission
   because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often
   associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social
   structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection
   and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the
   links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in
   primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only
   adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here,
   we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and
   an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole
   group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact
   of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test:
   (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of
   partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of
   social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection
   intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what
   extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might
   influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network
   analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over
   three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out
   simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group
   level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth
   infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult
   females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of
   this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical
   significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were
   removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group
   network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an
   effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that
   sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects
   involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting
   earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social
   networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations
   for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications
   for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Persistent challenges to public health and well-being are being
   addressed though complex interventions. Complex interventions are
   intentional processes designed to shift and realign the form and
   function of targeted system patterns by changing underlying system
   dynamics, structures, and conditions. The IM40 initiative was a complex
   health promotion intervention designed to address adolescent health and
   well-being through a developmental assets approach. The initiative
   sought to influence several levels simultaneously (e.g. individual,
   professional, procedural, and policy), compounding the complexity for
   implementation and evaluation. The purpose of this case study is to
   present the development and initiation of an evaluation approach based
   on systems thinking and complexity science principles, concepts, and
   methods. We used three systems methods, Group Model Building (GMB),
   viable systems model (VSM) assessment, and Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   to identify and examine underlying patterns and structures that
   influenced system-wide behaviors. Each method focused on a general
   systems-oriented question and illuminated stakeholder views of the IM40
   theory of change, adaptive organization of multiple independent
   institutions, and relational ties among system actors. Collectively, the
   methods enabled us to describe systems change over time and examine
   shifts in boundaries, relationships, perspectives, and dynamics. The
   implications of this approach relative to typical evaluation activities
   in public health practice are contrasted and discussed.},

Abstract = {Aim The main purpose of our study is to determine the current research
   status of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and birth defects by
   means of co-word analysis, to explore the hot spots and weak points of
   current research, and to provide ideas and opinions for follow-up
   researchers.
   Methods The PubMed database was used to investigate the knowledge
   structures of the applied words ART and birth defects. The published
   literature was searched until December 31, 2018. The extracted MeSH
   terms were quantified using the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix
   Builder and the high-frequency MeSH terms were determined. According to
   the MeSH term-source article matrix, hierarchical cluster analysis was
   performed using SPSS 19.0. The high frequency MeSH term co-occurrence
   matrix was constructed to support strategic diagram and social network
   analysis (SNA).
   Results According to the search strategy, 1635 papers were included. Of
   all the extracted MeSH terms, 105 high frequency MeSH terms were
   identified and the hotspots were classified into nine categories. In the
   strategic diagram, research on the effects of prenatal diagnosis methods
   and ART on the development of offspring has been well developed. In
   contrast, research on reproductive ethics, epigenetics, and epidemiology
   is relatively immature, indicating the need for future research. For SNA
   results, the position status of each component is described by the
   center value.
   Conclusions By providing a quantitative bibliometric study, it can help
   with the overall command of the latest topic and guide researchers in
   their new projects.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate longitudinal patterns of avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through a social network. Specifically, we wanted
   to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict
   future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between
   different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409
   individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely
   monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A
   retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were
   used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird,
   and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed
   from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure
   histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable
   longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether
   exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was
   associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step.
   Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing
   mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for
   birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to
   another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a
   positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was
   independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds
   ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in
   adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in
   distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of
   interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further
   characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian
   mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more
   likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries
   and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the
   contact (same species versus different species) were also significant
   predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model
   variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian
   mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and
   discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious
   process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low
   transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time
   even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation
   efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at
   reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population
   sustainability.},

Title = {The Impact of Cooperative Behavior between Social Organizations during
   the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in Shanghai: A Simulation Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 2022, a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created considerable
   challenges for the Shanghai public health system. However, conventional
   prevention and control strategies, which only rely on formal
   organizations, inefficiently decrease the number of infections. Thus, a
   multi-organization management mode is needed for pandemic prevention. In
   this paper, we applied a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to
   analyze how these social organizations cooperate with others and further
   identify the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and
   sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of
   social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of
   the actor's attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative
   behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220
   participants in 19 social organizations. The results indicated that the
   number of cooperative relationships increased during the pandemic, from
   44 to 162, which means the network between social organizations became
   more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models
   were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and e/s >
   2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a
   positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all
   except the ``same age group effect (-1.02){''}. The results also
   indicated that the social organizations tend to build relationships with
   more active actors in the community in every time period. This paper is
   of great significance regarding the innovation of public health system
   management and the improvement of Chinese grassroots governance.},

Abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to
   substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help
   institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter
   related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19.
   Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of
   artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using
   tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in
   English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the
   study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
   sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network
   of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral,
   or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also
   conducted.
   Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies,
   3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study
   timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified
   434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%)
   as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5
   dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment,
   emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological
   stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the
   states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North
   Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most
   positive sentiment.
   Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19
   discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. These
   themes and sentiments can clarify the public's response to COVID-19 and
   help officials navigate the pandemic.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Objective: Local health departments (LHDs) operate within complex,
   multisectoral organizational communication networks. Network composition
   may affect priorities, processes, and the reach of health information to
   key stakeholders. This study seeks to elucidate variation in local
   network structures to examine how different constellations may affect
   information sharing across audiences. Design: This study analyzes data
   from a 2016 US survey of 491 metropolitan LHDs and 556 nonmetropolitan
   LHDs. Researchers first conducted social network analysis of network
   density, defined as the total number of potential organizations
   contributing to a jurisdiction's health communication activities.
   Researchers then conducted logistic regression to compare the
   relationship between network density and reported health communication
   activities targeting 3 specific audiences: policy makers, lay publics,
   and mass media. Results: Three network types emerged on the basis of the
   number of organizations that contribute to health communication
   activities, with low-density Minimal networks more common in
   nonmetropolitan jurisdictions and higher-density Expanded and Robust
   networks more common in metropolitan jurisdictions. LHDs in Minimal
   networks were significantly less likely to communicate with policy
   makers, lay publics, and mass media than their counterparts in
   higher-density networks (P < .05). Conclusions: LHDs are embedded in
   organizational communication networks that vary in both the number of
   communication partners and the types of audiences reached. Examining
   their own local organizational communication networks may provide
   insights into LHDs that wish to improve the effectiveness of public
   health messaging. By adding organizational communication partners and
   reaching new audiences, LHDs in Minimal networks can expand the reach of
   messages designed to help policy makers, communities, and individuals
   promote health and prevent disease.},

Title = {A Systems Thinking Methodology for Studying Prevention Efforts in

Journal = {SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {555-573},
Month = {2021 OCT},
Abstract = {The turn to complexity in public health over the past 20 years has come
   as practitioners, policy makers and scholars lament the lack of progress
   in addressing wicked problems such as obesity, chronic disease and the
   social determinants of health. Systems science may be well suited to
   tackle such wicked problems. While there is a growing application of
   systems thinking tools and resources in public health, there are fewer
   examples that incorporate both systems tools and systemic inquiry
   processes. Prevention Tracker offered an opportunity to trial the
   combination of systems tools and systems thinking at the level of
   community chronic disease prevention efforts. Our methodology comprised
   four Domains of Inquiry. 1. Describing a prevention system 2. Guiding
   system change efforts 3. Monitoring change 4. Cross case comparison. We
   applied systems tools and methods to investigate each domain of inquiry
   such as group model building, social network analysis, graphic
   illustration, causal loop diagrams and system action learning. These
   methods were connected through the application of systemic inquiry
   processes that elevated the ongoing interrogation of boundary judgments,
   awareness of diverse and multiple perspectives, interrelationships and
   the importance of social learning. Prevention Tracker demonstrated that
   it is possible to apply a range of systems methods while also keeping
   focus on the overall systems science and the need for theoretical
   consistency. The four domains of inquiry enabled flexibility to adapt
   our approach in each context to learn and improve. This methodological
   capacity to learn and adapt may also be useful in tackling other health
   and social problems, such as the COVID19 pandemic. The overall findings
   from the study will be presented in separate publications.},

Month = {2021 NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the media
   discourse about the AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccine on Twitter. Study
   design: The study design used in this study is data scraping, media
   analysis, social network analysis, and botometer. Methods: We collected
   221,922 tweets containing `\#AstraZeneca' from 1 January 2021 to 22
   March 2021. From 50,080 tweets in the English language, we analysed the
   linked media sources and conducted a network detection study. Results:
   We found that the most frequently retweeted tweets were full of negative
   information, and in many cases came from media sources that are
   well-known for misinformation. Our analysis identified large
   coordination networks involved in political astroturfing and vaccine
   diplomacy in South Asia but also vaccine advocacy networks associated
   with European Commission employees. Conclusions: The results of this
   study show that Twitter discourse about \#AstraZeneca is filled with
   misinformation and bad press, and may be distributed not only
   organically by anti-vaxxer activists but also systematically by
   professional sources. (c) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Title = {Fixed orthodontic appliances and adolescents' peer relations in school A
   social network analysis using cross-sectional survey data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OROFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS-FORTSCHRITTE DER KIEFERORTHOPADIE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Studies from the 1970s and 1980s, but also recent investigations
   on social media suggest that wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance can
   be a cause of bullying and social exclusion. With the greater uptake of
   orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed
   braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable.
   This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects
   adolescents' social position in their peer networks using
   cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the
   seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about
   their social relationships in school. These directed network data were
   used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and
   victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical
   analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression
   models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19\% of the
   surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls
   with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for
   friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for
   victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These
   associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic
   differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically
   insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces
   in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students
   with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position
   in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses
   exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in
   interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology,
   epidemiology and medicine.},

Title = {Detection of Hate Speech in COVID-19-Related Tweets in the Arab Region:
   Deep Learning and Topic Modeling Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Background: The massive scale of social media platforms requires an
   automatic solution for detecting hate speech. These automatic solutions
   will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous
   literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised
   text classification task using classical machine learning methods or,
   more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this
   problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published
   work on English text.
   Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the
   COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to
   discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech.
   Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic
   tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were
   analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network
   (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being
   the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to
   discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets.
   Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region
   identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the
   number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among
   COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also
   revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%)
   contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN.
   This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the
   most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore,
   we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the
   time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate tweets
   (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it
   was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was
   weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the
   Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also
   identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the
   pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7
   identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran.
   Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the
   Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health
   challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent
   use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate
   speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech
   may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the
   threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive
   language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context
   of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.},

   Pandemic Narratives in Pennsylvania Using Computational Network Science},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {The recent COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the importance of effective
   communication strategies to control the spread of the virus and debunk
   misinformation. By using accurate narratives, both online and offline,
   we can motivate communities to follow preventive measures and shape
   attitudes toward them. However, the abundance of misinformation stories
   can lead to vaccine hesitancy, obstructing the timely implementation of
   preventive measures, such as vaccination. Therefore, it is crucial to
   create appropriate and community-centered solutions based on regional
   data analysis to address mis/disinformation narratives and implement
   effective countermeasures specific to the particular geographic area. In
   this case study, we have attempted to create a research pipeline to
   analyze local narratives on social media, particularly Twitter, to
   identify misinformation spread locally, using the state of Pennsylvania
   as an example. Our proposed methodology pipeline identifies main
   communication trends and misinformation stories for the major cities and
   counties in southwestern PA, aiming to assist local health officials and
   public health specialists in instantly addressing pandemic communication
   issues, including misinformation narratives. Additionally, we
   investigated anti-vax actors' strategies in promoting harmful
   narratives. Our pipeline includes data collection, Twitter influencer
   analysis, Louvain clustering, BEND maneuver analysis, bot
   identification, and vaccine stance detection. Public health
   organizations and community-centered entities can implement this
   data-driven approach to health communication to inform their pandemic
   strategies.},

Abstract = {PurposeFacing the global public health emergency (GPHE), the conflict of
   cultural differences and the imbalance of vital resources such as
   knowledge among different organizations are becoming more severe, which
   affects the enthusiasm and sustainability of firms' innovation heavily.
   It is an urgent problem to be solved for firms how to make use of
   internal knowledge and external power to help firms' sustainable
   innovation (FSI). Thus, the purpose of this study is to deeply analyze
   how firms' internal knowledge diversity (KD) and external ego-network
   structures {[}ego-network density (ED) and honest brokers (HB)] affect
   FSI, as well as how the ego-network structures (ED and HB) moderate the
   relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of the ego
   network. Design/methodology/approachBased on the data of the alliance
   innovation networks of China's new energy industries in 2009-2019, this
   study uses the social network analysis method and negative binomial
   regression model to explore the effect of KD and ego-network structures
   (ED and HB) on FSI, as well as the moderating effects of ego-network
   structures (ED and HB) on the relationship between KD and FSI based on
   the perspective of ego network. FindingsThis study finds that KD, ED and
   HB can boost FSI. Moreover, ED plays a negative moderating role in the
   relationship between KD and FSI. However, the negative moderating effect
   of HB on the relationship between KD and FSI is not significant.
   Research limitations/implicationsThis study presents fresh empirical
   evidence and new insights for firms on how to make full use of firms'
   internal KD and external ego-network structures to facilitate FSI.
   Originality/valueFirst, this study not only enriches the research on the
   consequences of KD but also expands our understanding of the
   knowledge-based view to some extent. Second, this study not only
   enriches the motivation research of the FSI based on the perspective of
   ego-network in the context of the GPHE but also expands the application
   scope of social network theory and sustainable innovation' theory in
   part. Third, this paper is a new attempt to apply social network theory
   and knowledge-based view at the same time.},

   resulting intersectoral synergies are considered cornerstones in the
   process of incorporating health promotion practices in everyday
   university life in order to break down barriers and provide better
   access to health promotion services. To date, no network of a
   health-promoting university has been examined regarding the processes
   underlying tie formation, network emergence, and maintenance.Objectives
   and methods The goals of this study are to obtain insight into the
   mechanisms of cooperation between university actors in a
   health-promoting network and to identify the structural and attributive
   factors associated with establishing cooperation between actors in the
   observed network in order to better understand how to build and develop
   successful networks in the future. For this purpose, a social network
   analysis was carried out and exponential random graph models were
   estimated to test corresponding hypotheses.Results The network at hand
   consists of 33 actors (e.g. University Sports Center, General Student
   Committee) and shows a flat, non-hierarchical structure. Data reveal
   that attributed competence predicts cooperation (0.32; p < 0.05).
   Significant homophily effects among student actors (1.31; p < 0.05) and
   among university actors (0.59; p < 0.05) were found. All structural
   predictors examined were significant (0.22-5.40; p < 0.05) and are
   therefore essential in determining the likelihood of cooperation between
   actors involved in the network.Conclusion The results of this study
   provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cooperation and
   can be used to further develop the network at hand (e.g. selection of
   key actors for information dissemination or integration of peripheral
   actors). In addition, the findings offer starting points for sustained
   network development at other universities (e.g. significance of network
   governance form or goal consensus). Knowing the factors that influence
   the network structure, here the conditions of cooperation, results in
   opportunities to encourage empowerment among actors. However, the
   analysis of the network undertaken does not directly bear on the success
   of the network.},

Title = {Using social network analysis to plan, promote and monitor intersectoral
   collaboration for health in rural India},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {Background
   As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors
   that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that
   acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors
   at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and
   lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis
   (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the
   organizations working on maternal \& child health (MCH) and water \&
   sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL
   Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural
   block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine
   public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder
   relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation
   involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a
   low-and middle-income countries.
   Method
   An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24
   organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh,
   India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured
   interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and
   homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative
   analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH.
   Results
   Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working
   on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of
   Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the
   organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to
   play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between
   other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points.
   Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in
   increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout
   the network.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA
   for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It
   also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the
   unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including
   challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the structure, content, quality, and quantity of
   partnerships that developed in response to a national cardiovascular
   health initiative, Million Hearts. Design: This study used a social
   network analysis (SNA) approach to assess the Million Hearts initiative
   network partnerships and identify potential implications for policy and
   practice. Setting/Participants: The Million Hearts network comprised a
   core group of federal and private sector partners that participate in
   Million Hearts activities and align with initiative priorities. To bound
   the network for the SNA, we used a list of 58 organizations (74\%
   response rate) from a previously completed qualitative analysis of
   Million Hearts partnerships. Main Outcome Measures: We used the online
   PARTNER (Program to Analyze Record and Track Networks to Enhance
   Relationships-) survey to collect data on individual organizational
   characteristics and relational questions that asked organizations to
   identify and describe their relationships with other partners in the
   network. Key SNA measures include network density, centralizations,
   value, and trust. Results: Our analyses show a network that is
   decentralized, has strong perceptions of trust and value among its
   members, and strong agreement on intended outcomes. Interestingly,
   partners report a desire and ability to contribute resources to Million
   Hearts; however, the perceptions between partners are that resources are
   not being contributed at the level they potentially could be. The
   majority of partners reported that being in the network helped them
   achieve their goals related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The
   largest barrier to successful activities within the network was cited as
   lack of targeted funding and staff to support participation in the
   network. Conclusions: The Million Hearts network described in this
   article is unique in its membership at the national level, agreement on
   outcomes, its powerful information-sharing abilities that require few
   resources, and its decentralized structure. We identified strategies
   that could be implemented to strengthen the network and its activities.
   By examining a national-level public-private partnership formed to
   address a public health issue, we can identify ways to strengthen the
   network and provide a framework for developing other initiatives.},

Abstract = {Opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma (OV-CCA) is a major public
   health problem in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Countries, the poorest
   region in Asia. People in this region have similar traditions or respect
   the same religion. There is no difference in lifestyle and food culture.
   Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS
   Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for
   OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk
   factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living
   along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional
   analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with
   informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics
   were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with
   95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It
   was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas,
   except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was
   found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater
   fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of
   nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani,
   Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and
   Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar
   (a reference area). This study provided the behavior-related risk
   factors for OV-CCA among people in five GMS Countries which would be a
   major jigsaw puzzle leading to proactive surveillance for OV-CCA
   prevention in the future.},

Abstract = {Pig farming in Ecuador represents an important economic and cultural
   sector, challenged by classical swine fever (CSF). Recently, the
   National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control
   the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination
   against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig
   premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement
   restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the
   network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected,
   recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were
   used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from
   2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard
   farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most
   influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and
   4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3
   shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy
   resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement
   restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement
   restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and
   markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the
   best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available,
   highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the
   network. When comparing the static network with its temporal
   counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in
   the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required
   4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS
   surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most
   at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal
   information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This
   information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance
   reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.},

Abstract = {Informed by the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB) and
   ego-network analysis, the present study outlines the mechanisms that
   contribute to the creation and maintenance of social norms and their
   subsequent behavioral outcomes. By analyzing different patterns of
   normative influence associated with cervical cancer detection among
   Latinas (N = 982), the study concludes that network brokerage provides
   individuals with nonredundant information, helps resist normative
   pressure, and contributes to efficacy beliefs, promoting more informed
   decision making. Conversely, network closure perpetuates conformity,
   increases the influence of social norms, and induces less confidence in
   individual's ability to comply with cervical cancer screening,
   subjecting Latinas to unnecessary health risks. Overall, the results
   suggest that the study of normative influence should be combined with
   social network analysis, trying to shed a light on the distinct social
   structures and communication practices that can either reinforce or
   challenge norms. These findings extend the discussion of social norms in
   health-related decision making to a more nuanced approach that

Month = {2023 OCT 17},
Abstract = {Objective: To describe network structure and alignment across
   organizations in healthcare, public health, and social services sectors
   that serve pregnant and parenting women with substance use disorder
   (SUD) in an urban and a rural community.Data Sources and Study Settings:
   Two community networks, one urban and one rural with each including a
   residential substance use treatment program, in Kentucky during
   2021.Study Design: Social network analysis measured system collaboration
   and cross-sector alignment between healthcare, public health, and social
   services organizations, applying the Framework for Aligning Sectors. To
   understand the alignment and structure of each network, we measured
   network density overall and between sectors, network centralization, and
   each organization's degree centrality and effective size.Data
   Collection/Extraction Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews
   were conducted to document alignment around shared purpose, data,
   financing, and governance.Principal Findings: On average, overall and
   cross-sector network densities in both communities were similar.
   However, alignment was highest for data sharing and financing in the
   urban community and for shared purpose and governance in the rural
   community. Cross-sector partnerships involving healthcare organizations
   were more prevalent in the rural county (44\% vs. 38\% for
   healthcare/public health, 44\% vs. 29\% for healthcare/social services),
   but more prevalent for those involving public health/social services
   organizations in the urban county (42\% vs. 24\%). A single healthcare
   organization had the highest degree centrality (Mdn {[}IQR] = 26
   {[}26-9.5]) and effective size (Mdn {[}IQR] = 15.9 {[}20.6-8.7]) within
   the rural county. Social services organizations held more central
   positions in the urban county (degree centrality Mdn {[}IQR] = 13
   {[}14.8-9.5]; effective size Mdn {[}IQR] = 10.4
   {[}11.4-7.9]).Conclusions: Cross-sector alignment may strengthen local
   capacity for comprehensive SUD care for pregnant and parenting women.
   Healthcare organizations are key players in cross-sector partnerships in
   the rural community, where one healthcare facility holds the central
   brokerage role. In contrast, public health agencies are key to
   cross-sector collaboration with social services in the urban community.},

Title = {A User-Centered Chatbot (Wakamola) to Collect Linked Data in Population
   Networks to Support Studies of Overweight and Obesity Causes: Design and
   Pilot Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Obesity and overweight are a serious health problem
   worldwide with multiple and connected causes. Simultaneously, chatbots
   are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in
   mobile health apps.
   Objective: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility
   study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of
   individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations.
   Methods: We first studied the users' needs and gathered users' graphical
   preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150
   design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics,
   diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and
   desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then
   designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to
   test feasibility.
   Results: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4
   specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot
   named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical
   activity, social network, user's status score, and project information.
   We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores
   about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and
   social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot
   implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who
   completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11\%), 5
   overweight people (7\%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4
   kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk
   and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10
   minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting
   30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network
   with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities.
   Conclusions: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect
   data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical
   activity, BMI, and specific diseases. Besides, the chatbot allows the
   connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity
   causes from both individual and social perspectives.},

Title = {Hierarchical Structure Model of Safety Risk Factors in New Coastal
   Towns: A Systematic Analysis Using the DEMATEL-ISM-SNA Method},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {When a coastal town transforms from a rural area to an emerging city, it
   faces many safety risks. Some are new risks from urban construction,
   while some are traditional risks that belong to this coastal area. The
   joint efforts of these risks may lead to new hazards, harming public
   health, but this problem has not been noticed in previous studies.
   Therefore, this study constructs the Triangular Framework for Safety
   Risk in New Towns to identify the risks and proposes strategies to
   reduce the risks. In this study, multiple methods are integrated,
   including Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL),
   Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Social Network Analysis
   (SNA). This study takes the Lin-gang Special Area in China as a case
   study to verify the framework's effectiveness. Sixteen disaster-causing
   factors are identified, and the internal linkages among these factors
   are clarified. Results show that the hybrid method performs well in
   quantitatively analyzing the risk factors of new coastal towns. A
   typhoon, public risk perception, and population migration are essential
   influencing factors. Disaster prevention capability of high-rise
   buildings, disaster prevention capacity of port facilities, and
   transportation are the most direct influencing factors. Environmental
   degradation is the most conductive among all elements. This study
   contributes to the theoretical theory by proposing an effective
   framework to analyze the safety risks in new coastal towns. In addition,
   it provides practical references for governments to make emergency plans

Abstract = {Multimorbidity can be defined as the presence of two or more chronic
   diseases in an individual. This condition is associated with reduced
   quality of life, increased disability, greater functional impairment,
   increased health care utilisation, greater fragmentation of care and
   complexity of treatment, and increased mortality. Thus, understanding
   its epidemiology and inherent complexity is essential to improve the
   quality of life of patients and to reduce the costs associated with
   multi-pathology. In this paper, using data from the European Health
   Survey, we explore the application of Mixed Graphical Models and its
   combination with social network analysis techniques for the discovery
   and classification of complex multimorbidity patterns. The results
   obtained show the usefulness and versatility of this approach for the
   study of multimorbidity based on the use of graphs, which offer the
   researcher a holistic view of the relational structure of data with
   variables of different types and high dimensionality.},

Title = {Understanding commercial actors' engagement in policy debates on
   proposed e-cigarette regulation in Scotland},
Journal = {TOBACCO CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {511-519},
Month = {2022 JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction There is growing concern about transnational tobacco
   corporations' (TTCs) and other commercial actors' involvement in
   e-cigarette policy development. Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used
   e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and
   re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other
   types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. Methods This
   paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement
   in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views
   on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy
   consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a
   social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors.
   Results The results show that commercial actors' positions on
   e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs,
   independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial
   actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation
   (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial
   actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent
   regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to
   gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about
   TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being
   largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating
   arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial
   actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm
   reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Conclusion Awareness of the various
   commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in
   e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy
   development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of

Abstract = {With the explosive growth of online social media, the ancient problem of

   aim of this survey is threefold: (1) we present the results of a
   network-based analysis of the existing multidisciplinary literature to
   support the search for relevant trends and central publications; (2) we
   describe the main results and necessary background to attack the problem
   under a computational perspective; (3) we review selected contributions
   using network science as a unifying framework and computational
   linguistics as the tool to make sense of the shared content. Despite
   scholars working on computational linguistics and networks traditionally

Abstract = {Background: Launched in 2012, the Claremont Healthy Village Initiative
   (CHVI) is a partnership focused on fostering community collaboration,
   addressing the social determinants of health, and reducing health
   disparities. Partners include local community centers, schools, after

   approach, we worked collaboratively with the CHVI leaders, we used
   paper-and web-based surveys grounded in social network theory were
   administered in 2017 and 2018. Ques-tions focused on relationships
   between organizations that are part of the coalition. Our analysis
   included responses from organizations that participated in the survey at
   both points in time. Network measures such as density, degree
   centrality, and node characteristics were used to understand information
   sharing, referral, and collaboration among the participating
   organizations. Additional data included stake-holder interviews.Results:
   Coalition partners increased connectedness with one another over the
   course of the study, with significantly greater density of relationship
   and bi-directional partnerships in the follow-up survey. Of the three
   types of interactions, referrals showed a trend for highest density
   change. Trust levels were highest among organizations with a local
   physical presence.Conclusions: Social network analysis provided visual
   and quantitative information that helped reinforce relationships and
   identify opportunities to improve connectedness and collaboration among
   diverse community partners, helping to support the coalition's goals and

   Networks in New Energy Vehicles: Evidence from Shenzhen, China},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {With the increasing attention to climate change, air pollution, and
   related public health issues, China's new energy vehicles (NEVs)
   industry has developed rapidly. However, few studies investigated the
   evolution of interorganizational collaborative innovation networks in
   the sector domain of NEVs and the influence of different drivers on the
   establishment of innovation relationships. In this context, this paper
   uses the joint invention patent of Shenzhen, a low-carbon pilot city of
   China, to investigate the dynamics of network influencing factors. The
   social network analysis shows that the scale of coinvention network of
   NEVs is constantly increasing, which is featured with diversified
   cooperative entities, and collaboration depth (i.e., the intensity of
   the interactions with these partners) is also expanding. The empirical
   results from the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) demonstrate that,
   with the deepening of collaborative innovation, technological upgrading
   caused by knowledge exchange makes organizations in the network more
   inclined to cognitive proximity and less dependent on geographical
   proximity. In addition, organizational proximity and triadic closure
   contribute positively to the collaborative network, with their relevance
   remaining nearly the same, while the impeding effect of
   cultural/language difference is slightly decreasing with time.},

Title = {Network-Based Delivery and Sustainment of Evidence-Based Prevention in
   Community-Clinical Partnerships Addressing Health Equity: A Qualitative
   Exploration},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Background:Increased delivery of evidence-based preventive services can
   improve population health and increase health equity. Community-clinical
   partnerships offer particular promise, but delivery and sustainment of
   preventive services through these systems face several challenges
   related to service integration and collaboration. We used a social
   network analysis perspective to explore (a) the range of contributions
   made by community-clinical partnership network members to support the
   delivery of evidence-based preventive services and (b) important
   influences on the ability of these partnerships to sustain service
   delivery. Methods:Data come from an implementation evaluation of the
   Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund initiative, which supported nine
   Massachusetts communities to coordinate delivery of evidence-based
   prevention and address inequities in hypertension, pediatric asthma,
   falls among older adults, or tobacco use. In 2016, we conducted
   semi-structured interviews with (a) leadership teams representing nine
   community-level partnerships and (b) practitioners from four
   high-implementation partnerships (n= 23). We managed data using NVivo11
   and utilized a framework analysis approach. Results:Key network
   contributions for delivery of evidence-based preventive services
   included creating referrals, delivering services, providing links to
   community members, and administration and leadership. Less emphasized
   contributions included wraparound services, technical assistance, and
   venue provision. Implementers from high-implementation partnerships also
   highlighted contributions such as program adaptation, creating buy-in,
   and sharing information to improve service delivery. Expected drivers of
   program sustainability included the ability to develop a business case,
   ongoing network facilitation, technology support, continued integrated
   action, and sufficient staffing to maintain programming. Conclusion:The
   study highlights the need to take a long-term, infrastructure-focused
   approach when designing community-clinical partnerships. Strategic
   partnership composition, including identifying sources of necessary
   network contributions, in conjunction with efforts from the outset to
   link systems, align effort, and build a long-term funding structure can
   support the required coordinated action around preventive services
   needed to improve health equity.},

Abstract = {One of the top ten foodborne parasitic infections of global concern is
   human infection of liver fluke through the consumption of raw or

   human-environmental interactions of raw fish sharing and procurement
   connections on the geographic variation in liver fluke infection. We
   first discuss the networks embedded in the parasite life cycle that
   propagates disease transmission. Then, we collect 820 questionnaires
   from three provinces in northeast Thailand to visualize their
   fish-sharing and sharing-procurement networks, analyze how the
   connectivity differences in these networks might be linked to
   participants' consumption behaviors and environmental settings, and
   determine how all these together affect liver fluke infection risks. The
   results show that infection was positively associated with procuring
   fish from ponds, but negatively associated with procuring fish from
   rivers. Incorporating fish procurement sites substantially increases
   network connectivity, reinforcing the human connection to key fish
   sources as a potential risk factor for infection. The consideration of
   the connections between human, disease hosts, and the environment,
   compared to the previously human-centric approach of deworming, offers
   new insights for public health intervention.},

   research},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Background: Community engagement (CE) has been regarded as a critical
   element of successful health programs to achieve ``the health for
   all{''} goals. Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant
   role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing
   benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite
   this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health
   (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across
   disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify
   current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and
   future developments in this field.
   Methods: The bibliometric techniques were applied in the analysis of
   publications on CEPH in Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson
   Reuters. One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million
   publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references
   were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of
   publications, including distributions of geography, journals and
   categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were
   obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis,
   co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection,
   were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and
   evolution of CEPH.
   Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a
   sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or
   regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are
   geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the
   key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half
   of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South
   Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements
   of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and
   evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic
   actions. Based on keyword clustering and co-citation clustering, we
   propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome)
   framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current
   global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the
   future.
   Conclusion: This study draws an outline of the global review on the
   contemporary and cross-disciplinary research of CEPH which might present
   an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as
   well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are
   fundamental to inform policy making.},

Title = {Dynamic Evolution Analysis of the Emergency Collaboration Network for
   Compound Disasters: A Case Study Involving a Public Health Emergency and
   an Accident Disaster during COVID-19},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Compound disasters are highly complex and can involve different types of
   disasters. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compound
   disasters of public health emergencies, accident disasters, and natural
   hazards have occurred frequently all over the world; therefore, it is
   important to establish effective compound disaster emergency
   collaboration networks. Thus, this study examined the 7 March building
   collapse in Quanzhou City as a case study. This case was a typical
   compound disaster involving a public health emergency and an accident
   disaster during COVID-19. Based on the network analysis, the overall
   response and dynamic characteristics of the emergency collaboration for
   compound disasters were examined in this study. A compound disaster
   emergency collaboration network (ECN) was constructed by identifying the
   interactional relationships between emergency organizations. After
   applying time slices, the dynamic evolution of network structure,
   organizational-functional relations, organizational attributes, and
   cross-organizational relationships were discussed. The research results
   showed the following: (1) The density and connectivity of the compound
   disaster ECN first decreased before increasing. Meanwhile, the evolution
   of the network structure followed a path from decentralized to
   concentrated and from being uneven to an equilibrium. (2) The
   characteristics and practices of compound disasters during different
   periods indicated varied emergency needs for emergency organizations. We
   found that the formation of emergency tasks not only involved the
   passive adaptation to match the practice for compound disasters, but
   also the active choices of emergency organizations when facing compound
   disasters according to their collective experiences and decisions. (3)
   The national emergency management departments, the government emergency
   rescue organizations, and the local governments were the core
   organizations of the ECN. Public health management departments and
   social organizations were also required to participate in the ECN to
   improve the diverse and heterogeneous distribution of resources. (4)
   With increased demands during a compound disaster emergency, the number
   of cross-organizational collaborative relationships gradually increased.
   This study explored compound disaster emergencies from the perspective
   of network analysis to improve our understanding of the current and
   developing organizational relationships and practices during a compound
   disaster event. The dynamic characteristics of compound disasters
   require efficient adaptation and improvements of the collaborative
   mechanisms involved during emergencies.},

Abstract = {Most Chinese provinces have a daily-updated database of live animal
   movements; however, the data are not efficiently utilized to support
   interventions to control H7N9 and other avian influenzas. Based on
   official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of
   live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and
   monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial
   movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in
   2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi.
   Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of
   inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces.
   Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler
   movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the
   province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar
   New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this
   study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live
   bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017
   were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting
   that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and
   reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same
   small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more
   than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same
   throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and
   improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be
   more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented
   indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that
   targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the
   movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease
   transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence
   to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and
   all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.},

Title = {Predicting the number of article citations in the field of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with the 100 top-cited
   articles since 2014: a bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY},

Abstract = {Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
   neurodevelopmental disorder in children or early adolescents with an
   estimated worldwide prevalence of 7.2\%. Numerous articles related to
   ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had
   ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number
   of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis
   (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100
   most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject
   headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations.
   Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100
   most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded.
   Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of
   article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social
   network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for
   providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the
   MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation
   coefficients (CC).
   Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were
   research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most
   productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the
   United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most
   articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child
   and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms
   were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations
   (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were
   excluded because they do not have MeSH terms).
   Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to
   display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in
   predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top
   100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and
   other academic disciplines.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidity has increased worldwide.
   Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is
   associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality
   of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of
   comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and
   better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used
   in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health
   conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the
   progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This
   study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the
   Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity
   progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in
   Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and
   represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph
   theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e.,
   patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were
   selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian
   health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed
   from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two
   baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a
   normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte
   disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients
   with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that
   these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD
   in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially
   help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the
   progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the
   framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and
   private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health
   management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple
   chronic diseases.},

   Bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Number = {25},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have explored the most productive and
   influential authors in a specific field. However, 2 challenges arise
   when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical
   names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may
   vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address
   these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was
   to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness
   centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited
   authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes.
   Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between
   2000 and 2020 using the keyword ``Medicine {[}Journal].{''} Author
   names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were
   collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index
   was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names
   affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC
   method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major
   clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index
   within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH
   terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their
   research themes.
   Results: Our findings revealed the following: within the top 10 cited
   authors, 2 authors from China shared identical names with Jing Li and
   Tao-Wang; JA Winkelstein from Maryland (US) had the highest x-index
   (15.58); Chia-Hung Kao from Taiwan was the most prolific author, having
   published 115 articles in Medicine since 2003; and the 3 primary
   research themes, namely, complications, etiology, and epidemiology, were
   identified using MeSH terms from the 10 most frequently cited authors.
   Conclusions: Using AWS and BC, we identified the top 10 most cited
   authors. The research methods we utilized in this study (BC and AWS)
   have the potential to be applied to other bibliometric analyses in the
   future.},

   an innovative combination of relative risk and social network analysis

   epidemiology studies, is used to strategically investigate whether first
   year mathematics subjects at the university demonstrated a higher risk
   of attrition when compared to other subjects offered in the first year
   of study. The network analysis is used to illustrate the connections of
   those mathematics subjects, identifying service subjects through their
   multiple connections. The analysis revealed that attrition rates for
   eight of the nine subjects were within acceptable limits, and this
   included identified service subjects. The exception highlighted the
   issue of mathematics competencies in this cohort. This combined
   analytical technique is proposed as appropriate for use when
   investigating attrition and retention at faculty and institutional

Title = {Cognitive cascades: How to model (and potentially counter) the spread of
   fake news},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs-often called
   misinformation or disinformation-through a population has never seemed
   so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from
   epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to
   how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from
   those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's
   set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly
   documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming
   messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or
   rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze
   agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but
   they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in
   empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade
   model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an
   internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion
   diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media
   institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the
   model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive
   effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds
   expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of
   the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across
   various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue
   from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model
   qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public
   opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to
   address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a
   framework with which social science misinformation researchers and
   computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand,
   and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation
   and ``alternative facts.{''}},

Abstract = {Little information exists on how to garner political commitment to

   shaping breastfeeding programmes and policies through four domains of
   influence: commands (n 32 stakeholders), dissemination (n 40), funding
   (n 35) and technical assistance (n 37). The Federal Ministry of Health
   emerged as the most influential stakeholder of breastfeeding policy and
   programming decisions in Mexico among all domains of influence. The
   Ministry of Finance and Public Credit as well as the National Institute
   of Public Health were identified as additional key stakeholders
   providing funding and technical assistance to the Federal Ministry of

   Mixed methods combining qualitative interviews with 24 organisations and
   Social Network Analysis with 75 organisations were completed in 2018 in
   two communities (Denton, TX and Sarasota, FL) with robust examples of
   health and social systems alignment. Findings suggest that while

   the potential increase in referrals from clinical settings is not
   something they are fully aware of, or prepared for, as evidenced by
   inadequate funding models, misalignment between capacity and capability,
   and a lack of coordination on screening and referral activities.
   Misalignment between clinical and CBO understanding of demand, needs and
   capacity present a potential risk in building strategies that integrate
   health and social services to address unmet social need. Failing to
   build a strong cross-sector screening and referral infrastructure that

   factor. The Pathways to Desistance data were used in analyses,

Title = {Health Disparities in Staphylococcus aureus Transmission and Carriage in
   a Border Region of the United States Based on Cultural Differences in
   Social Relationships: Protocol for a Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Health care-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are
   declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated
   infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health
   mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term
   goal is to use risk-based information from empirical
   socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to
   inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the
   community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural
   affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage
   and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors.
   Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates
   and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with
   disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups
   and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2)
   evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of
   health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission
   of S aureus.
   Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health
   sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer
   transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community
   and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if
   strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of
   community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from
   participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission
   within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social
   determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history,
   etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to
   determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S
   aureus transmission.
   Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of
   survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on
   the original funded design for this project (\#NIH U54MD012388). That
   design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337
   individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data
   assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined
   data monitoring procedures.
   Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific
   prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will
   also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are
   concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis
   of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission
   pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our
   understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across
   clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged
   nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for
   completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of
   S aureus carriage and transmission.},

Title = {Planning, implementing and governing systems-based co-creation: the
   DISCOVER framework},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {BackgroundIncreasingly, public health faces challenges requiring
   complex, multifaceted and multi-sectoral responses. This calls for
   systems-based approaches that facilitate the kind of collective and
   collaborative thinking and working required to address complexity. While
   the literature on systems thinking, system dynamics and the associated
   methodologies is extensive, there remains little clear guidance on how
   to plan, govern and implement participatory systems approaches within a
   co-creation process.MethodsWe used a three-step process to develop
   DISCOVER, a framework for implementing, and governing systems-based
   co-creation:Stage 1: We conducted a literature analysis of key texts to
   identify well-documented methods and phases for co-creation using a
   systems approach, as well as areas where gaps existed.Stage 2: We looked
   for the most appropriate methods and approaches to fill the gaps in the
   knowledge production chain.Stage 3: We developed the framework,
   identifying how the different tools and approaches fit together
   end-to-end, from sampling and recruiting participants all the way
   through to responding with an action plan.ResultsWe devised DISCOVER to
   help guide researchers and stakeholders to collectively respond to
   complex social, health and wider problems. DISCOVER is a strategic
   research planning and governance framework that provides an actionable,
   systematic way to conceptualise complex problems and move from evidence
   to action, using systems approaches and co-creation. In this article, we
   introduce the eight-step framework and provide an illustrative case
   study showcasing its potential. The framework integrates complementary
   approaches and methods from social network analysis, systems thinking
   and co-creation literature. The eight steps are followed sequentially
   but can overlap.ConclusionsDISCOVER increases rigour and transparency in
   system approaches to tackling complex issues going from planning to
   action. It is being piloted in environmental health research but may be
   suitable to address other complex challenges and could be incorporated
   into research proposals and protocols for future projects.},

Title = {Dynamic Networks that Drive the Process of Irreversible Step-Growth
   Polymerization},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Many research fields, reaching from social networks and epidemiology to
   biology and physics, have experienced great advance from recent
   developments in random graphs and network theory. In this paper we
   propose a generic model of step-growth polymerisation as a promising
   application of the percolation on a directed random graph. This
   polymerisation process is used to manufacture a broad range of polymeric
   materials, including: polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, and many
   others. We link features of step-growth polymerisation to the properties
   of the directed configuration model. In this way, we obtain new
   analytical expressions describing the polymeric microstructure and
   compare them to data from experiments and computer simulations. The
   molecular weight distribution is related to the sizes of connected
   components, gelation to the emergence of the giant component, and the
   molecular gyration radii to the Wiener index of these components. A
   model on this level of generality is instrumental in accelerating the
   design of new materials and optimizing their properties, as well as it
   provides a vital link between network science and experimentally
   observable physics of polymers.},

Abstract = {Contagion processes have been widely studied in epidemiology and life
   science in general, but their implications are largely tangible in other
   research areas, such as in network science and computational social
   science. Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the
   study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its
   applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing
   campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic
   networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place
   when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some
   of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish
   papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in
   their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider
   that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon
   involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in
   scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered
   those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is
   generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in
   bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge,
   information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different
   meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper,
   we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of
   inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show
   its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors,
   papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large
   bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used
   as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic
   ranking applications.},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {To slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, many universities shifted
   to online instruction and now face the question of whether and how to
   resume in-person instruction. This article uses transcript data from a
   medium-sized American university to describe three enrollment networks
   that connect students through classes and in the process create social
   conditions for the spread of infectious disease: a university-wide
   network, an undergraduate-only network, and a liberal arts college
   network. All three networks are ``small worlds{''} characterized by high
   clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths
   connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together,
   but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major
   integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or
   more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses
   are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed
   before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and
   less than two-thirds in four steps. In all simulations, most students
   are connected through multiple independent paths. Hybrid models of
   instruction can reduce but not eliminate the potential for epidemic
   spread through the small worlds of course enrollments.},

Abstract = {Peer context is a pivotal social process shaping adolescent health
   behavior. Using a representative youth cohort, we aimed to characterize
   the dynamics in friendship networks among Taiwanese adolescents, and
   further examined the reciprocal effects between substance use and
   delinquent behaviors that we hypothesized to manifest via the impacts of
   dynamic changes of the friendship network. The data were retrieved from
   the Taiwan Youth Project (N = 2,566; 51\% boys; Mage at baseline = 12.3
   +/- 0.48 years). Participants were requested to nominate their best
   friends at school and to report their substance use, delinquent
   behaviors, and pubertal development. Stochastic actor-based modeling was
   used for the networking analyses. While taking their network structure
   into account, adolescents select friends based on similarity in class at
   school (beta = 0.929 {[}standard error = 0.088], p < 0.001) and gender
   (beta = 1.787 {[}0.188], p < 0.001), but not in their externalizing
   behaviors. In the behavior dynamics submodel, affiliation with male
   friends (beta = 0.452 {[}0.178], p = 0.005) and peer substance use
   status (beta = 0.613 {[}0.124], p = 0.004) were associated with a higher
   likelihood of engaging in delinquent behavior. Our findings highlight
   the influence of peers on the co-development of substance use and
   delinquent behavior in adolescents. Workers in healthcare and the public
   health sector should be aware of this and formulate prevention policies
   accordingly.},

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},
Pages = {188-197},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines whether country implementation of a public health
   treaty is influenced by the implementation behaviors of other countries
   to which they have network ties. We examine implementation of the
   Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) adopted by the World
   Health Organization in 2003 and ratified by approximately 94\% of
   countries as of 2016. We constructed five networks: (1) geographic
   distance, (2) general trade, (3) tobacco trade, (4) GLOBALink referrals,
   and (5) GLOBALink co-subscriptions. Network exposure terms were
   constructed from these networks based on the implementation scores for
   six articles of the FCTC treaty. We estimate effects using a lagged Type
   1 Tobit model. Results show that network effects were significant: (a)
   across all networks for article 6 (pricing and taxation), (b) distance,
   general trade, GL referrals, and GL co-subscriptions for article 8
   (second hand smoke), (c) distance, general trade, and GL
   co-subscriptions for article 11 (packaging and labeling), and (d)
   distance and GL co-subscription for article 13 (promotion and
   advertising), (e) tobacco trade and GL co-subscriptions for article 14
   (cessation). These results indicate that diffusion effects were more
   prevalent for pricing and taxation as well as restrictions on smoking in
   public places and packaging and labeling. These results suggest that
   network influences are possible in domains that are amenable to control
   by national governments but unlikely to occur in domains established by
   existing regulatory systems. Implications for future studies of policy
   implementation are discussed.},

Title = {Mechanisms Driving Online Vaccine Debate During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The prevalence of the anti-vaccine movement in today's society has
   become a pressing concern, largely amplified by the dissemination of
   vaccine skepticism. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   the vaccination debate sparked controversial debates on social media
   platforms such as Twitter, which can lead to serious consequences for
   public health. What determines anti-vax attitudes is an important
   question for understanding the source of the campaigns and mitigating
   the misinformation spread. Compared with other countries, Turkiye
   differentiates itself with high vaccination rates and lack of political
   support for anti-vaxxers despite its highly polarized political system.
   Analyzing Turkish Twittersphere, we explore several mechanisms capturing
   content production and behaviors of accounts within the pro- and
   anti-vax segments in online vaccine-related discussions. Our findings
   indicate there is no relation between political stance and anti-vaccine
   attitude. Both supporters of vaccination (pro-vaxxers) and opponents
   (anti-vaxxers) can be found across the political spectrum. Moreover,
   linguistic differences reveal that anti-vaxxers employ more emotional
   language, while pro-vaxxers express more skepticism. Notably, automated
   accounts are less prevalent leading to difficulty in assessing genuine
   support for vaccines, while anti-vaccine bots produce slightly more
   content. These findings have crucial implications for vaccine policy,
   emphasizing the importance of understanding diverse language patterns
   and beliefs among anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers to develop effective
   communication strategies at the national level.},

Abstract = {Background: In the last decade, tuberculosis (TB) incidence among Inuit
   in the Canadian Arctic has been rising. Our aim was to better understand
   the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using
   whole-genome sequencing.
   Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in
   Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within
   clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with
   detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm.
   Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the
   WGS data analysis.
   Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified,
   all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all
   cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster,
   2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading
   events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was
   linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further
   transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An
   algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events
   demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95\% confidence
   interval, .97-1.0).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely
   residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house,
   combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant
   factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic
   community.},

Title = {On increasing the contribution of locally produced fresh foods to school
   meals in the Caribbean},
Journal = {FOOD SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 25},
Abstract = {The rising prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity within the
   Caribbean is a major public health and policy concern because obese
   children are at risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
   later in life. Throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), children
   are consuming unhealthy diets, characterized by energy-dense, processed
   and ultra-processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages, and limited
   quantities of fruits and vegetables. Community-based school meal
   programmes (SMPs) have been identified as useful vehicles to address
   unhealthy eating among children, and ``farm-to-school{''} approaches
   have the potential to increase the availability of locally grown
   nutritious produce, while supporting local agriculture and reducing the
   region's reliance on food imports. This paper seeks to better understand
   the barriers to enhancing community-based school feeding value-chains in
   the CARICOM, by focusing on the Eastern Caribbean Island of Nevis where
   there is an interest in developing farm-to-school value chains. Using
   key informant interviews combined with focus groups with actors along
   the local food value chain, we identify the following barriers to an
   effective community-based SMP: a lack of communication and an absence of
   contractual agreements between local farmers and the SMP administration;
   generally low levels of child acceptance of school meals containing
   fresh vegetables; and limited intersectoral coordination and
   collaboration among SMP stakeholders and local farmers. Using social
   network analysis, we further discuss limitations in group organization
   and coordination among local farmers and opportunities for SMP
   improvement. The results point to the need for more integrative public
   policy development and greater community engagement to coordinate and
   strengthen the farm-to school approach to school feeding.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Background: The importance of intersectoral cooperation networks among
   community organizations located in people's immediate environments in
   addressing population health problems such as physical inactivity has
   come into focus in recent years. To date, there is limited evidence on
   how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were
   (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the
   conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of
   sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on
   cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and
   physical activity providers as well as sports administrating
   organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in
   southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations;
   Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive
   procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network
   modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar
   structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks
   (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations
   had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random
   graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in
   triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central
   actors (preferential attachment effect). Organizations from different
   sectors cooperated more often than organizations from the same sector
   (heterophily effect). Conclusion: The study provided valid and robust
   findings on significant mechanisms and conditions of interorganizational
   cooperation in community networks focused on sport and physical activity
   promotion. Based on the results, implications for the development and
   most efficient governance of these networks can be derived.},

Abstract = {Objective: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Prevention
   Research Centers (PRCs) collaborate on public health activities with
   community agencies and organizations. We evaluated these collaborations
   by studying the relationships between co-authors from the PRCs and

   first year of the program. Methods: We identified all the authors of
   articles published by PRCs and collaborating members in peer-reviewed
   journals between September 2014 and September 2015 and constructed a
   network showing the links between and among all the authors. We
   characterized the network with 4 measures of social structure (network
   components, network density, average clustering coefficient, average
   distance) and 3 measures of individual author performances (degree-,
   betweenness-, and closeness-centrality). Results: The 413 articles had
   1804 individual authors and 7995 co-authorship relationships (links) in
   212 peer-reviewed journals. These authors and co-authors formed 44
   separate, nonoverlapping groups (components). The largest ``giant{''}
   component containing most of the links involved 66.3\% (n = 1196) of the
   authors and 73.7\% (n = 5889) of the links. We identified 136
   ``information brokers{''} (authors with high closeness centrality: those
   who have the shortest links to the most authors). Two authors with high
   betweenness centrality (who had the highest number of co-authors; 104
   and 107) had the greatest ability to mediate co-authorships. Network
   density was low; only 0.5\% of all potential co-authorships were
   realized (7995 actual co-authorship/1 628 110 potential co-authorships).
   Conclusion: Information brokers and co-authorship mediators should be
   encouraged to communicate more with each other to increase the number of
   collaborations between network members and, hence, the number of
   co-authorships.},

Abstract = {Objective: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a serious

   study was conducted in the Greater Houston region ofTexas, , and social
   network analysis was performed by constructing facility-to-facility
   patient transfer network using CRE surveillance data. The network method
   (community detection algorithm) was used to detect clustering patterns
   of CRE in the network. In addition, network measures of centrality and
   local connectivity (clustering coefficient) were computed for each
   healthcare facility. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis
   was applied to test the association between network measures and
   facility-specific incidence rate of CRE. Results: A network of 268
   healthcare facilities was identified, in which 10 acute-care hospitals
   (ACHs) alone accounted for 63\% of identified CRE cases. Transmission of
   New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing CRE occurred in 3 clusters,
   yet all cases were traced to patients who had had medical care abroad.
   The incidence rate of CRE attributed to ACHs was >4-fold (adjusted rate
   ratio, 4.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 3.02-6.72) higher than that
   of long-term care facilities. Each additional patient shared with
   another HCF conferred a 3\% (95\% CI, 2\%-4\%) increase in the incidence
   rate of CRE at that HCF. Conclusions: The incidence rates of CRE at a
   given HCF was predicted by the healthcare network metrics. Increased
   surveillance and selective targeting of high-risk facilities are
   warranted.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to theoretically and experimentally
   investigate the literature on university-industry linkages (UILs)
   through a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. Seven
   research questions were addressed in the present study: (1) descriptive
   characteristics of the literature on UIL, (2) trends of annual
   scientific publications on UIL, (3) the most relevant and high-impact
   sources on UIL, (4) the most globally cited articles on UIL, (5) the
   most relevant countries on UIL, (6) outcomes of Bradford's Law of
   Scattering and Lotka's Law of scientific productivity and (7) the
   trending research areas and avenues for future studies on UIL.
   Design/methodology/approach - Systematic literature review and
   bibliometric analysis mapping techniques were applied to the present
   study to analyze 907 articles extracted from the Scopus database.
   Analysis tools used were Biblioshiny software and VOSviewer software.
   Findings - Findings show that the UIL is a progressively growing
   discipline with a record of a 5.71\% average annual growth rate in
   scientific production each year from 1970 to 2023. The United States,
   China and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries in the
   field of UIL in terms of total scientific production and citations.
   Academic entrepreneurship, industrial ecology, social network analysis,
   active learning, engineering education, health economics, public health,
   university-industry relationships, communication, causal layered
   analysis and competitiveness are the potential avenues for future
   researchers in the field of UIL based on the thematic map of keywords

Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The emergence and enduring diffusion of COVID-19 has had a dramatic
   impact on cities worldwide. The scientific aim of this study was to
   introduce geospatial thinking to research related to infectious
   diseases, while the practical aim was to explore the impact on
   population movements and urban linkages in the longer term following a
   pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study took 366 cities in China as the
   research subjects while exploring the relationship between urban contact
   and the outbreak of the pandemic from both national and regional
   perspectives using social network analysis (SNA), Pearson correlation
   analysis and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)
   modeling. The results revealed that the number of COVID-19 infections in
   China fluctuated with strain variation over the study period; the urban
   contact network exhibited a significant trend of recovery. The pandemic
   had a hindering effect on national urban contact, and this effect
   weakened progressively. Meanwhile, the effect exhibited significant
   spatial heterogeneity, with a weakening effect in the eastern region \&
   AP; northeast region > central region > western region, indicating a
   decreasing phenomenon from coastal to inland areas. Moreover, the four
   major economic regions in China featured border barrier effects, whereby
   urban contact networks constituted by cross-regional flows were more
   sensitive to the development of the pandemic. The geostatistical
   approach adopted in this study related to infectious disease and urban
   linkages can be used in other regions, and its findings provide a
   reference for China and other countries around the world to respond to
   major public health events.},

Abstract = {Background: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) comprise over 90\% of the world's
   congenital anomalies and cause significant disability worldwide, while
   disproportionally burdening low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Research can help inform strategies that reduce disparities in accessing
   CLP care. We performed a scientometric analysis of CLP research in LMICs
   to identify influential contributors and themes.
   Methods: The authors searched seven citation databases accessed via Web
   of Science, from inception to March 2, 2021. Social network analysis was
   done using VOSviewer. The Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were
   used.
   Results: In total, 1561 articles authored by 6414 researchers affiliated
   with 2113 organizations in 119 countries were included. Most authors (n
   = 6387, 99.6\%) had published two or more articles. The USA (454
   articles), Brazil (211 articles), China (175 articles), and India (127
   articles) published the most. The most prolific institutions were the
   University of Sao Paulo (94 articles), the University of Pittsburgh (57
   articles), and the University of Iowa (55 articles). Marazita ML (33
   articles), Shi B (27 articles), and Murray JC (22 articles) had the
   highest number of publications. An estimated 510 articles (32.7\%) were
   focused on epidemiology, 240 (15.4\%) on management, and 54 (3.5\%) on
   global plastic surgery for CLP.
   Conclusions: LMICs are disproportionally burdened by CLP, but research
   is limited and often produced by high-income countries. This study
   elucidates partnership and health system strengthening opportunities to
   improve LMIC research capacity and ultimately informs the management and
   outcomes for patients with CLP.},

Abstract = {The Food Chain Plus (FoCus) cohort was launched in 2011 for
   population-based research related to metabolic inflammation. To
   characterize this novel pathology in a comprehensive manner, data
   collection included multiple omics layers such as phenomics,
   microbiomics, metabolomics, genomics, and metagenomics as well as
   nutrition profiling, taste perception phenotyping and social network
   analysis. The cohort was set-up to represent a Northern German
   population of the Kiel region. Two-step recruitment included the
   randomised enrolment of participants via residents' registration offices
   and via the Obesity Outpatient Centre of the University Medical Center
   Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH). Hence, both a population- and metabolic
   inflammation- based cohort was created. In total, 1795 individuals were
   analysed at baseline. Baseline data collection took place between 2011
   and 2014, including 63\% females and 37\% males with an age range of
   18-83 years. The median age of all participants was 52.0 years {[}IQR:
   42.5; 63.0 years] and the median baseline BMI in the study population
   was 27.7 kg/m(2) {[}IQR: 23.7; 35.9 kg/m(2)]. In the baseline cohort,
   14.1\% of participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was more
   prevalent in the subjects of the metabolic inflammation group (MIG;
   31.8\%). Follow-up for the assessment of disease progression, as well as
   the onset of new diseases with changes in subject's phenotype, diet or
   lifestyle factors is planned every 5 years. The first follow-up period
   was finished in 2020 and included 820 subjects.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We measured the health resource agglomeration capacities of 31 Chinese
   provinces (or municipalities) in 2004-2018 based on the entropy weight
   method. Using a modified spatial gravity model, we constructed and
   analyzed the spatial correlation network of these health resource
   agglomeration capacities and their influencing factors through social
   network analysis. We found that: (i) China's health resource
   agglomeration capacity had a gradual strengthening trend, with capacity
   weakening from east to west (strongest in the eastern region, second
   strongest in the central region, and weakest in the western region).
   (ii) The spatial network of such capacities became more densely
   connected, and the network density and level (efficiency) showed an
   upward (downward) trend. (iii) In terms of centrality, the high-ranking
   provinces (or municipalities) were Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
   Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Tianjin,
   while the low-ranking were Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner
   Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xinjiang, Hainan, Shaanxi, and
   Shanxi. (iv) Block 1 (eight provinces or municipalities), including
   Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, had a ``net spillover{''} effect in the
   spatial network of health resource agglomeration capacities; Block 2,
   (seven provinces or municipalities), including Shanghai, Jiangsu, and
   Zhejiang, had a ``bidirectional spillover{''} effect in the spatial
   network; Block 3 (seven provinces or municipalities), including Anhui,
   Hubei, and Hunan, had a ``mediator{''} effect in the network; and Block
   4, (nine provinces or municipalities), including Sichuan, Guizhou, and
   Tibet, had a ``net beneficial{''} effect in the network. (v) The
   economic development, urbanization wage, and financial health
   expenditure levels, and population size had significant positive
   correlations with the spatial network of health resource agglomeration
   capacities. Policy recommendations to enhance the radiating role of
   health resources in core provinces (or municipalities), rationally
   allocate health resources, and transform ideas to support public health
   resource services were provided.},

Abstract = {This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect
   contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs
   through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China.
   All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from
   the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed.
   Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the
   network between source counties was the primary objective of this study.
   A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network
   were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated
   for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of
   different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an
   epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from
   151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in
   January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from
   one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001)
   than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from
   counties inside Guangdong Province (90\%), along with counties in Hunan,
   Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties
   (46 in total) contributed 94\% of the total batches during the two-month
   study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km
   from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January
   and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in
   January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a
   shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The
   most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and
   western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing
   counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness,
   degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of
   a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform
   targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig
   market trade network in south China.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveMarginalized communities shoulder a disproportionate burden of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) driven by concentrated neighborhood social
   risk factors. We provide a case study of systems science application to
   address geographic CVD health disparities at the community level -
   informing the science of CVD health disparities research. MethodsWe
   conducted a two-phased, multi-methods needs assessment in the Denver,
   Colorado area. Phase I consisted of a social network analysis to map a
   two-mode network of existing CVD prevention interventions and their
   implementing organizations. In Phase II, group model building (GMB)
   sessions with key community, public health, and healthcare provider
   stakeholders, were utilized to identify and visualize community factors
   contributing to disparities in CVD risk, producing a consensus-based
   causal loop diagram. ResultsBetween May 2021 and June 2022, we conducted
   24 virtual, semi-structured interviews in Phase I to describe CVD
   prevention interventions, and 7 virtual GMB sessions in Phase II to
   describe experiences of disparities in CVD risk. For the purposes of
   this paper, we focus on a subset of results for both phases. In Phase I
   we identified 89 active CVD prevention interventions, 29 of which
   addressed tobacco use. In Phase II, causal loop diagrams revealed root
   causes of disparities in CVD risk. We provide an example of a causal
   loop diagram that focuses on the community prevalence of tobacco use,
   identifying stress as a key underlying factor driving disparities. The
   integration of findings from both phases highlighted the alignment and
   misalignment between quit tobacco intervention goals and how they are
   being experienced in marginalized communities. ConclusionSystems science
   methods were useful to organize a large number of CVD prevention
   efforts, and evaluate the root causes of CVD health disparities in a
   high risk community. By integrating these two aspects, interventions may
   be reoriented to more effectively address the root causes of CVD health
   disparities.},

Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility
   datasets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records,
   and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These datasets have
   fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of
   mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban
   planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature
   addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal
   trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering
   the statistical ``laws{''} that govern human movements. A significant
   effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic
   trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human
   mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial
   problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the
   re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on
   state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical
   software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the
   aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we
   propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of
   providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze
   mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is
   efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library
   for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many
   functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic
   data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk

Title = {Effective resistance against pandemics: Mobility network sparsification
   for high-fidelity epidemic simulations},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Network science has increasingly become central to the field of
   epidemiology and our ability to respond to infectious disease threats.
   However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large,
   but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human
   mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to
   many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires
   substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically
   infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating
   epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a representative
   subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance.
   We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive
   thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S.
   Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most
   accurate approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which
   prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between
   their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of
   the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the
   epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the
   probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival
   times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10\%
   of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical
   utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted,
   undirected network are most important to disease spread.
   Author summary
   Epidemiologists increasingly use social networks to understand how
   geography, demographics, and human mobility affect disease spread and
   the effectiveness of intervention strategies. While highly detailed data
   on human social networks are now available, the size and density of
   these modern networks makes them computationally intensive to study. To
   address this challenge, we study methods for reducing a network to its
   most important links. Following recent work in computer science, we use
   the effective resistance, which takes both local and global connectivity
   into account. We test this method in simulations on a U.S.-wide mobility
   network and find that it preserves epidemic dynamics with high fidelity.
   Combined with efficient epidemic simulation algorithms, our approach can
   facilitate a more effective response to epidemics.},

Abstract = {Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises
   that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological
   purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production
   chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases
   through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social
   network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns
   and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the
   movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures
   in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as
   bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and
   slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over
   the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil
   with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the
   static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade,
   (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises
   from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the
   potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the
   cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease
   transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease
   spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the
   study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly
   connected (similar to 94\%) trade network, with strong temporal trends,
   especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly
   clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential
   for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB
   transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top
   7\% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the
   total number of infected farms over three years by >50\%. In conclusion,
   the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly
   connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being
   close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having
   animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and
   betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between
   premises in RS.},

Title = {Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults:
   Evidence From the ELSI-Brazil Study},

Abstract = {Background: The association between social isolation and cognitive
   perfor-mance has been less investigated in low-to-middle-income
   countries (LMIC) and the presence of depression as a moderator on this
   association has not been examined. The authors examined the associations
   of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance
   in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this
   cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite
   score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The
   dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered
   memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and
   logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical
   variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms
   with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression,
   measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale,
   modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age
   = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were
   associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI:
   0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B
   = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms
   with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with
   loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker
   association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among
   those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an
   LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse
   cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the
   strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are
   important to assess the direction of the association between social
   isolation and cognitive performance. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2023;

Abstract = {Objective Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations, occur commonly
   in children and have been related to bullying victimization. However,
   whether bullying perpetration, peer rejection, or peer acceptance are
   related to hallucinatory experiences has remained under-examined. We
   used a novel peer nomination method to examine whether (i) bullying
   perpetration and (ii) social positions within peer networks were
   associated with future hallucinatory experiences.
   Methods This prospective study was embedded in the population-based
   Generation R Study. Bullying perpetration, peer rejection, and peer
   acceptance were assessed using peer nominations at age 7 years (N =
   925). Using a social network analysis, we estimated social positions
   within peer rejection and acceptance networks. Bullying victimization
   was assessed using self-reports. Self-reported hallucinatory experiences
   were assessed at age 10 years. Analyses were adjusted for
   sociodemographic covariates.
   Results Higher levels of bullying perpetration were prospectively
   associated with an increased burden of hallucinatory experiences (OR =
   1.22, 95\% CI 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011). Bullies had a 50\% higher, and
   bully-victims had a 89\% higher odds, of endorsing hallucinatory
   experiences three years later than children who were not involved in
   bullying (ORbully = 1.50, 95\% CI 1.01-2.24, p = 0.045; ORbully-victim =
   1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10, p = 0.012). Unfavorable positions within peer
   rejection networks, but not peer acceptance networks, were associated
   with an increased risk for hallucinatory experiences (ORpeer rejection =
   1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.44, p(FDR-corrected) = 0.024).
   Conclusion Using peer reports, we observed that bullies and socially
   rejected children have a higher likelihood to report hallucinatory
   experiences in pre-adolescence. Children who are both a bully and a
   victim of bullying (ie, bully-victims) may be particularly vulnerable
   for psychotic experiences.},

Title = {Scientific and technological contributions of Latin America and
   Caribbean countries to the Zika virus outbreak},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe recent Zika virus (ZIKAV) epidemics disclosed a major
   public health threat and a scientific and technological (S\&T)
   challenge. The lessons learned from the S\&T response of Latin America
   and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further
   research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to
   assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can
   contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and
   social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific
   contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to
   December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of
   Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles
   were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and
   LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the
   Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit
   Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were
   individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe
   retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase
   from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications
   and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global
   network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by
   experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC
   assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC
   research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection,
   along with vector control, which was also the main focusof
   patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of
   ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a
   key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV;
   (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV
   clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was
   potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the
   ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing
   patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech
   patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary
   approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and
   control future outbreaks.},

Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundCharacterizing the diffusion of adopted changes in policy and
   clinical practice can inform enhanced implementation strategies to
   ensure prompt uptake in public health emergencies and other rapidly
   evolving disease areas. A novel guidance document was introduced at the
   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada, which
   supported clinicians to prescribe opioids, stimulants, and
   benzodiazepines. We aimed to determine the extent to which uptake and
   discontinuation of an initial attempt at a prescribed safer supply (PSS)
   program were influenced through networks of prescribers.MethodsWe
   executed a retrospective population-based study using linked health
   administrative data that captured all clinicians who prescribed to at
   least one client with a substance use disorder from March 27, 2020, to
   August 31, 2021. Our main exposure was the prescribing patterns of an
   individuals' peers, defined as the proportion of a prescribers'
   professional network (based on shared clients), which had previously
   prescribed PSS, updated monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a
   clinician had prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given
   calendar month. The secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS
   prescribing, defined as an absence for PSS prescriptions for at least 3
   months. We estimated logistic regression models using generalized
   estimated equations on monthly repeated measurements to determine and
   characterize the extent to which peer networks influenced the initiation
   and discontinuation of PSS prescribing, controlling for network,
   clinician, and caseload characteristics. Innovators were defined as
   individuals initiating PSS prior to May 2020, and early adopters were
   individuals initiating PSS after.ResultsAmong 14,137 prescribers
   treating clients with substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators
   of prescribed safer supply and 1062 early adopters through the end of
   study follow-up, but 653 (50.6\%) were no longer prescribing by August
   2021. Prescribers with over 20\% of peers whom had adopted PSS had a
   nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing themselves (aOR:
   3.79, 95\% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those with no connected safer
   supply prescribers.ConclusionsThe uptake of PSS in BC was highly
   dependent on the behavior of prescribers' peer networks. Future
   implementation strategies to support PSS or other policies would benefit
   from leveraging networks of prescribers.},

Title = {Network analysis of frailty and aging: Empirical data from the Mexican
   Health and Aging Study},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {128},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Frailty remains a challenge in the aging research area with
   a number of gaps in knowledge still to be filled. Frailty seems to
   behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter.
   Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was
   the main purpose of our study.
   Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012,
   mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit
   frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The
   edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning,
   and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic
   graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms,
   hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the
   graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and
   tertiles of the total FI score.
   Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8\%
   were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of
   connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As
   the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how
   the nodes are connected changed.
   Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network.
   Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health
   (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits
   related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are
   considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with
   vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all
   deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and
   non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the
   construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify
   the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the
   development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of
   frailty in older adults.},

Title = {Families' healthcare experiences for children with inherited metabolic
   diseases: protocol for a mixed methods cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction Children with inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) often
   have complex and intensive healthcare needs and their families face
   challenges in receiving high-quality, family centred health services.
   Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple
   components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This
   study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of
   children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and
   analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be
   used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter
   experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care
   map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months.
   Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis.
   Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of
   healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions
   will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative
   data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be
   summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and
   purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for
   stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one
   videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data
   regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will
   be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be
   merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care
   experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and
   presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a
   theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display.
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were approved
   by the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Research Ethics Board,
   the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board and the research ethics
   boards of each participating study centre. Findings will be published in
   peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.},

Abstract = {The Chinese healthcare system faces a dilemma between its
   hospital-centric approach to healthcare delivery and a rapidly ageing
   population that requires strong primary care. To improve system
   efficiency and continuity of care, the Hierarchical Medical System (HMS)
   policy package was issued in November 2014 and fully implemented in 2015
   in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. This study aimed to investigate the
   impact of the HMS on the local healthcare system. We conducted a
   repeated cross-sectional study with quarterly data collected between
   2010 and 2018 from Yinzhou district, Ningbo. The data were analysed with
   an interrupted time series design to assess the impact of HMS on the
   changes in levels and trends of three outcome variables: primary care
   physicians' (PCPs') patient encounter ratio (i.e. the mean quarterly
   number of patient encounters of PCPs divided by that of all other
   physicians), PCP degree ratio (i.e. the mean degree of PCPs divided by
   the mean degree of all other physicians, with the mean degree revealing
   the mean activity and popularity of physicians, which reflected the
   extent to which he/she coordinated with others in delivering health
   services), and PCP betweenness centrality ratio (i.e. the mean
   betweenness centrality of PCPs divided by the mean betweenness
   centrality of all other physicians; the mean betweenness centrality was
   interpreted as the mean relative importance of physicians within the
   network, indicating the centrality of the network). Observed results
   were compared with counterfactual scenarios computed based on pre-HMS
   trends. Between January 2010 and December 2018, 272 267 patients visited
   doctors for hypertension, a representative non-communicable disease with
   a high prevalence of 44.7\% among adults aged 35-75 years, amounting to
   a total of 9 270 974 patient encounters. We analysed quarterly data of
   45 464 observations over 36 time points. Compared to the counterfactual,
   by the fourth quarter of 2018, the PCP patient encounter ratio rose by
   42.7\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 27.1-58.2, P < 0.001], the PCP
   degree ratio increased by 23.6\% (95\%CI: 8.6-38.5, P < 0.01) and the
   PCP betweenness centrality ratio grew by 129.4\% (95\%CI: 87.1-171.7, P
   < 0.001). The HMS policy can incentivize patients to visit primary care
   facilities and enhance the centrality of PCPs within their professional
   network.},

Abstract = {Background: Online health communities (OHCs) have increasingly gained
   traction with patients, caregivers, and supporters globally. Chinese
   OHCs are no exception. However, user-generated content (UGC) and the
   associated user behaviors in Chinese OHCs are largely underexplored and
   rarely analyzed systematically, forfeiting valuable opportunities for
   optimizing treatment design and care delivery with insights gained from
   OHCs.
   Objective: This study aimed to reveal both the shared and distinct
   characteristics of 2 popular OHCs in China by systematically and
   comprehensively analyzing their UGC and the associated user behaviors.
   Methods: We concentrated on studying the lung cancer forum (LCF) and
   breast cancer forum (BCF) on Mijian, and the diabetes consultation forum
   (DCF) on Sweet Home, because of the importance of the 3 diseases among
   Chinese patients and their prevalence on Chinese OHCs in general. Our
   analysis explored the key user activities, small-world effect, and
   scale-free characteristics of each social network. We examined the UGC
   of these forums comprehensively and adopted the weighted knowledge
   network technique to discover salient topics and latent relations among
   these topics on each forum. Finally, we discussed the public health
   implications of our analysis findings.
   Results: Our analysis showed that the number of reads per thread on each
   forum followed gamma distribution (H-L=0, H-B=0, and H-D=0); the number
   of replies on each forum followed exponential distribution (adjusted
   R-L(2) =0.946, adjusted R-B(2)=0.958, and adjusted R-D(2) =0.971); and
   the number of threads a user is involved with (adjusted R-L(2)=0.978,
   adjusted R-B(2)=0.964, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.970), the number of
   followers of a user (adjusted R-L(2)=0.989, adjusted R-B(2)=0.962, and
   adjusted R-D(2)=0.990), and a user's degrees (adjusted R-L(2)=0.997,
   adjusted R-B(2)=0.994, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.968) all followed power-law
   distribution. The study further revealed that users are generally more
   active during weekdays, as commonly witnessed in all 3 forums. In
   particular, the LCF and DCF exhibited high temporal similarity
   (rho=0.927; P<.001) in terms of the relative thread posting frequencies
   during each hour of the day. Besides, the study showed that all 3 forums
   exhibited the small-world effect (mean sigma(L)=517.15, mean
   sigma(B)=275.23, and mean sigma(D)=525.18) and scale-free
   characteristics, while the global clustering coefficients were lower
   than those of counterpart international OHCs. The study also discovered
   several hot topics commonly shared among the 3 disease forums, such as
   disease treatment, disease examination, and diagnosis. In particular,
   the study found that after the outbreak of COVID-19, users on the LCF
   and BCF were much more likely to bring up COVID-19-related issues while
   discussing their medical issues.
   Conclusions: UGC and related online user behaviors in Chinese OHCs can
   be leveraged as important sources of information to gain insights
   regarding individual and population health conditions. Effective and
   timely mining and utilization of such content can continuously provide
   valuable firsthand clues for enhancing the situational awareness of
   health providers and policymakers.},

Title = {Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping
   transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding
   an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for
   identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen
   dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can
   spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity.
   Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less
   commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly
   consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The
   objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement
   versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an
   economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the
   U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such
   data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and
   elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we
   construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the
   networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been
   recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We
   evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and
   evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying
   network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case
   occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via
   network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local
   area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways,
   though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of
   case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x
   higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network
   k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random
   expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p <
   0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on
   proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance
   than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of
   local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall
   levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement
   network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread
   transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network
   analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of
   between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of
   transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and
   highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon
   heterogeneities in network connectivity.},

Title = {Exploring challenges and opportunities in detecting emerging drug
   trends: A socio-technical analysis of the Canadian context},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 29},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aimed to apply a systems thinking approach to
   explore factors influencing the detection of emerging drug trends in
   Canada's provinces and territories to better understand how the local
   context can influence the design and performance of a pan-Canadian
   (i.e., national) substance use early warning system (EWS). This study
   also presents a set of actionable recommendations arising from the
   results.Methodology and methodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted
   with 13 purposively recruited Medical Officers of Health and
   epidemiologists from across Canada working in the field of substance
   use. Thematic and social network analysis guided by the socio-technical
   systems framework were subsequently employed.ResultsBarriers and
   facilitators for detecting emerging drug trends in provinces and
   territories are a product of the collective linkages and interactions
   between social (objectives, people, culture), technical (tools,
   practices, infrastructure), and external environmental (financial,
   regulatory frameworks, stakeholders) factors. Shortcomings in several of
   these areas shaped the system's behaviour and together contributed to
   fragmented operations that lacked strategic focus, poorly designed
   cross-sector partnerships, and unactionable information outputs.
   Participants' experiences shaped perceptions of a national substance use
   EWS, with some voicing potential opportunities and others expressing
   doubts about its effectiveness.ConclusionThis study highlights
   interconnected social, technical, and external environmental
   considerations for the design and implementation of a national substance
   use EWS in Canada. It also demonstrates the value of using the
   socio-technical systems framework to understand a complex public health
   surveillance issue and how it can be used to inform a path forward.
   ObjectifsCette etude visait a appliquer une approche de pensee
   systemique pour explorer les facteurs influencant la detection des
   tendances emergentes en matiere de drogues dans les provinces et
   territoires (P/T) du Canada afin de mieux comprendre comment le contexte
   local peut influencer la conception et le rendement d'un systeme
   pancanadien (c.-a-d. national) d'alerte precoce (SAP) en matiere de
   consommation de substances. Cette etude presente egalement un ensemble
   de recommandations realisables decoulant des resultats.Methodologie et
   methodesDes entrevues semi-structurees ont ete menees aupres de 13
   medecins hygienistes et epidemiologistes recrutes dans tout le Canada et
   travaillant dans le domaine de la toxicomanie. L'analyse des reseaux
   thematiques et sociaux guidee par le cadre des systemes socio-techniques
   (STS) a ensuite ete utilisee.ResultatsLes obstacles et les facilitateurs
   a la detection des tendances emergentes en matiere de drogues dans les
   provinces et les territoires sont le produit des liens et des
   interactions collectifs entre les facteurs sociaux (objectifs,
   personnes, culture), techniques (outils, pratiques, infrastructure) et
   environnementaux externes (cadres financiers, reglementaires,
   intervenants). Les lacunes dans plusieurs de ces domaines ont faconne le
   comportement du systeme et, ensemble, ont contribue a des operations
   fragmentees qui manquaient d'orientation strategique, a des partenariats
   intersectoriels mal concus et a de l'information inexploitable. Les
   experiences des participants ont faconne les perceptions d'un SAP
   national sur la consommation de substances, certains exprimant des
   opportunites potentielles et d'autres exprimant des doutes quant a son
   efficacite.ConclusionCette etude met en evidence les considerations
   sociales, techniques et environnementales externes interconnectees pour
   la conception et la mise en oe uvre d'un SAP national sur la
   consommation de substances au Canada. Il demontre egalement la valeur de
   l'utilisation du cadre STS pour comprendre un probleme complexe de
   surveillance de la sante publique et comment il peut etre utilise pour
   eclairer une voie a suivre.},
