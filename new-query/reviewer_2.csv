Social media use increased worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials and methods Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network analysis would help reduce the ``infodemic{''} before administering the vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively in this regard.","10.1080/21645515.2021.2025008",NA,"2164-5515","2164-554X","WOS:000750770500001","Durmaz, Nihal/AAV-7433-2021 ","Durmaz, Nihal/0000-0002-3079-1769 HENGIRMEN, ENGIN/0000-0001-9330-3251","JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

Graph embedding methods build an important bridge between social network analysis and data analytics as social networks naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously. Publishing social network data not only bring benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also give birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework using ground truth social network datasets.","10.26599/TST.2021.9010083",NA,"1007-0214","1878-7606","WOS:000814631700007","Li, Kaiyang/HFZ-9987-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

Objective: Health conspiracy theories are gaining in popularity. This study's objective was to evaluate the Twitter social media network related to the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and apply social capital theory to analyze the unique social structures of influential users. As a strategy for web-based public health surveillance, we conducted a social network analysis to identify the important opinion leaders sharing the conspiracy, the key websites, and the narratives. Methods: A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using social network analysis. Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13, 2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. Tweets were retrieved via a dedicated Twitter application programming interface. More specifically, the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research Foundation) and Gephi. Results: There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users within the data set. This study found that the most influential user within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the magnetic vaccine conspiracy. There were also several other users that became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the network. Conclusions: Our study found that influential users were effective broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond their own networks of Twitter followers. We emphasize the need for trust in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be unpredictable. This study highlights the potential of influential users to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique social capital.","10.2196/43497","e43497","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:001005979900003","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/L-6071-2017 ","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/0000-0002-1027-0165 Fuster-Casanovas, Aina/0000-0001-9128-9580 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12

Kirkpatrick","Strategies to find audience segments on Twitter for e-cigarette education campaigns","ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS",2019,"91","SI","222-226","APR","The development of public health education campaigns about tobacco products requires an understanding of specific audience segments including their views, intentions, use of media, perceived barriers, and benefits of change. For example, identifying and targeting individuals who express ambivalence about e-cigarette use on Twitter may be helpful in devising and focusing public health campaigns to reduce e-cigarette use. This study developed a novel analytic strategy using social network analysis to identify audience segments on Twitter based on positive, negative, and neutral e-cigarette sentiment Using Twitter data collected from April 2015 to March 2016, we identified different sub-groups of users who retweeted about e-cigarettes, and measured each subgroup's clustering coefficient (CC), which describes how tightly people cluster together. Ten high CC and ten low CC groups were randomly selected; then 100 randomly selected tweets from each group were coded for e-cigarette sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Results indicate that differences in e-cigarette sentiment are associated with clustering of Twitter network ties. Statistical analyses revealed that high CC groups were more likely to have strong e-cigarette sentiments, suggesting that tightly clustered groups may be ``echo chambers{''} (i.e., like-minded people repeating the same messages). By contrast, low CC groups were more likely to have neutral sentiments, and had greater fluctuation in sentiment over time, suggesting that they may be more flexible in their opinions about e-cigarettes and may be particularly receptive to targeted public health campaigns. Informatics techniques such as determination of clusters using social network analysis can be useful in identifying audience segments for future public health campaigns.","10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.11.015",NA,"0306-4603","1873-6327","WOS:000458711400033",NA,"Chu, Kar-Hai/0000-0002-2486-8846 Unger, Jennifer/0000-0001-9064-6603",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14

Method/process We study SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' personal (i.e., self-disclosure) and situational (i.e., social networks) attributes, using a mixed design of content analysis and social network analysis. Result/conclusion We compare users' within-person changes in self-disclosure and social networks in two phases (over half a year), drawing on Weibo Depression SuperTalk, an online community for depression, and find: Several network attributes strengthen social support, including network connectivity, global efficiency, degree centralization, hubs of communities, and reciprocal interactions. Users' self-disclosure attributes reflect positive changes in mental well-being and increased attachment to the community. Correlations exist between users' topological and self-disclosure attributes. A Poisson regression model extracts self-disclosure attributes that may affect users' received social support, including the writing length, number of active days, informal words, adverbs, negative emotion words, biological process words, and first-person singular forms. Innovation We combine social network analysis with content analysis, highlighting the need to understand SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' self-disclosure (content) and communication partners (social networks). Implication/contribution Authentic user data helps to avoid recall bias commonly found in self-reported data. A longitudinal within-person analysis of SNS' effects on well-being is helpful for policymakers in public health intervention, community managers for group organizations, and users in online community engagement.","10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1092884","1092884","1664-1078",NA,"WOS:000967089900001",NA,"Khoo, Zhao Wei/0009-0009-8469-7864 shi, jiayi/0000-0003-4215-3374",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16

For public health campaigns, how to diffuse the message broadly and efficiently in the social network is a classical problem, which is named Influence Maximization (IM). IM can be considered as an algorithmic problem of finding a small set of network users as seed nodes that maximizes the spread of influence for a piece of information under a certain influence cascade model. With a lot of researches focusing on this field, most existing solutions are proposed to extract seed nodes only considering pure topological structures. In practice, nodes in health-related networks are often abundantly accompanied with other types of meaningful information such as node attributes (identity), second-order proximity, and edge attributes (user relationship), while conventional IM models overlook these information. Therefore, a general framework for incorporating the heterogeneous information into an IM model could be potentially helpful to find underlying seed nodes in health-related networks. Moreover, the stability and the computational cost are also the main challenges that current IM models face. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose NE-IM (Network Embedding for Influence Maximization), a method that aspires to address both problems using representation learning. NE-IM composes of two components: Structure-based embedding and feature-based embedding. They are the projections of network structures and heterogeneous information respectively in a low dimensional space, so that each node in health-related network can be represented as a fix dimensional vector. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform baseline approaches.","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946391",NA,"2169-3536",NA,"WOS:000497163000067","ZHANG, hui jie/HTN-1690-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19

Most of the proposals have focused on dealing with static datasets gathered from social networks, which are processed and mined off-line. However, little work has been done on providing a general framework to analyse the highly dynamic data of social networks from a multidimensional perspective. In this paper, we claim that such a framework is crucial for including social data in PHS systems. Methods: We propose a dynamic multidimensional approach to deal with social data streams. In this approach, dynamic dimensions are continuously updated by applying unsupervised text mining methods. More specifically, we analyse the semantics and temporal patterns in posts for identifying relevant events, topics and users. We also define quality metrics to detect relevant user profiles. In this way, the incoming data can be further filtered to cope with the goals of PHS systems. Results: We have evaluated our approach over a long-term stream of Twitter. We show how the proposed quality metrics allow us to filter out the users that are out-of-domain as well as those with low quality in their messages. We also explain how specific user profiles can be identified through their descriptions. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed multidimensional model can be used to identify main events and topics, as well as to analyse their audience and impact. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed dynamic multidimensional model is able to identify relevant events and topics and analyse them from different perspectives, which is especially useful for PHS systems.","10.3390/ijerph17072289","2289",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000530763300121","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/ABF-5171-2021 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/K-9590-2014","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/0000-0002-8026-8351 Lanza Cruz, Indira Lazara/0000-0003-2413-2799 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/0000-0002-9155-269X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20

Background: Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has more recently been used to study health-related topics including obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence, quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and reproducibility. Methods: We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks, take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters. Results: We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also present an example of SNA. Conclusions: SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors-and subsequently health.","10.1177/19375867211013772","19375867211013772","1937-5867","2167-5112","WOS:000649496900001","Culyba, Alison/GNP-5083-2022 ","Rankine, Jacquelin/0000-0002-8072-6762 Culyba, Alison/0000-0002-1080-2176 Burgette, Jacqueline/0000-0001-5677-6295","MAY 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online information, particularly information on social media. The first step toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization debate on social media platforms.Objective: We aimed to evaluate societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance.Methods: Social network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets published in English and French were collected through the Twitter application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised machine learning approach to natural language processing using a sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine hesitancy.Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) of the conversations on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) expressed criticism toward the government's handling of the pandemic.Conclusions: Social media content analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered, as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.","10.2196/28800","e28800",NA,"2564-1891","WOS:001129248500004","Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015 ","Benham, Jamie L/0000-0002-2233-4613 Fullerton, Madison/0000-0002-8345-2859 Tang, Theresa/0000-0001-8569-5953 Mourali, Mehdi/0000-0002-9969-3892 Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37

The complete procedure for carrying out a social network analysis (SNA) is a time-consuming task that entails a series of steps in which the expert in social network analysis could make mistakes. This research presents a multi-domain knowledge model capable of automatically gathering data and carrying out different social network analyses in different domains, without errors and obtaining the same conclusions that an expert in SNA would obtain. The model is represented in an ontology called OntoSNAQA, which is made up of classes, properties and rules representing the domains of People, Questionnaires and Social Network Analysis. Besides the ontology itself, different rules are represented by SWRL and SPARQL queries. A Knowledge Based System was created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a real case study in order to show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the results of an SNA analysis obtained through the model were compared to those obtained from some of the most widely used SNA applications: UCINET, Pajek, Cytoscape and Gephi, to test and confirm the validity of the model.

Graph embedding methods build an important bridge between social network analysis and data analytics, as social networks naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously. Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also gives birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework using ground truth social network datasets.","10.26599/TST.2021.9010015",NA,"1007-0214","1878-7606","WOS:000703899400003","Cai, Zhipeng/AAA-7659-2021 ","Zhang, Kainan/0000-0003-4267-7143 Cai, Zhipeng/0000-0001-6017-975X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39

Many community-based programmes design interventions to address tangible challenges within the social determinants of health, such as asset insecurity or food insecurity, to address health inequities. The growing need to address social isolation within marginalised communities also requires organisations to collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen their own social integration within the community. The present research reports on the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of community programmes within three southern U.S. cities and their local collaborations to address social isolation. After interviewing representatives of 46 community organisations, it was found that social service organisations that also offer public health services play a central role in community efforts to improve social isolation. The participating organisations primarily collaborate through referrals and information sharing, and report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition that social services and supports play a considerable role in addressing health inequities, this study provides evidence of opportunities for interorganisational collaboration to promote individual and community health.","10.1111/hsc.14044",NA,"0966-0410","1365-2524","WOS:000862272800001",NA,"Creel, Liza/0000-0003-1222-678X","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41

The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees.

The consumption of alcohol in adolescents is known to be influenced by seeing friends and even parents drinking alcohol. Building on this fact, a number of studies into alcohol consumption among adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to study the different social networks (peers, friends, family, etc.) with whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need an initial phase of data gathering by means of questionnaires and a subsequent analysis phase using the SNA techniques. The process involves a number of manual data handling stages that are time consuming and error-prone. The use of knowledge engineering techniques (including the construction of a domain ontology) to represent the information, allows the automation of all the activities, from the initial data collection to the results of the SNA study. This paper shows how a knowledge model is constructed, and compares the results obtained using the traditional method with this, fully automated model, detailing the main advantages of the latter. In the case of the SNA analysis, the validity of the results obtained with the knowledge engineering approach are compared to those obtained manually using the UCINET, Cytoscape, Pajek and Gephi to test the accuracy of the knowledge model.

Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. Using social network analysis, we identified potential superspreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd in Mississippi. Analysis of age structure revealed that the majority of potential super-spreaders were young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also compared infection risk across the landscape by combining social network analysis and heatmapping software to locate disease transmission hotspots, where the risk of disease transmission is higher as compared to other locations. We also monitored predator and hunting activity and hunter deer harvests to better understand how predators influence social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity influenced the age structure of male WTD communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or the removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model for predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, describes new methods to locate transmission hotspots, and provides new knowledge for disease management and prevention strategies. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, WTD) spread communicable diseases such the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is a major public health concern, and chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, highly contagious prion disease occurring in cervids. Currently, it is not well understood how WTD are spreading these diseases. In this paper, we speculate that ``super-spreaders{''} mediate disease transmission via direct social interactions and indirectly via body fluids exchanged at scrape sites. Super-spreaders are infected individuals that infect more contacts than other infectious individuals within a population. In this study, we used network analysis from scrape visitation data to identify potential super-spreaders among multiple communities of a rural WTD herd. We combined local network communities to form a large region-wide social network consisting of 96 male WTD. Analysis of WTD bachelor groups and random network modeling demonstrated that scraping networks depict real social networks, allowing detection of direct and indirect contacts, which could spread diseases. Using this regional network, we model three major types of potential super-spreaders of communicable disease: in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness potential super-spreaders. We found out-degree and betweenness potential super-spreaders to be critical for disease transmission across multiple communities. Analysis of age structure revealed that potential super-spreaders were mostly young males, less than 2.5 years of age. We also used social network analysis to measure the outbreak potential across the landscape using a new technique to locate disease transmission hotspots. To model indirect transmission risk, we developed the first scrape-to-scrape network model demonstrating connectivity of scrape sites. Comparing scrape betweenness scores allowed us to locate high-risk transmission crossroads between communities. We also monitored predator activity, hunting activity, and hunter harvests to better understand how predation influences social networks and potential disease transmission. We found that predator activity significantly influenced the age structure of scraping communities. We assessed disease-management strategies by social-network modeling using hunter harvests or removal of potential super-spreaders, which fragmented WTD social networks reducing the potential spread of disease. Overall, this study demonstrates a model capable of predicting potential super-spreaders of diseases, outlines methods to locate transmission hotspots and community crossroads, and provides new insight for disease management and outbreak prevention strategies.","10.3390/ani13071171","1171","2076-2615",NA,"WOS:000969429200001",NA,"Huang, Miranda/0000-0001-8891-9772",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51

The producers of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the public's willingness to comply with public health measures. Our results show the necessity of further research about sophisticated social experiments such as the Plandemic disinformation campaign and provide important insights for policy-making to combat the spread of health misinformation during public health crises.","10.3389/fpubh.2021.649930","649930",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000678708700001","Pieters, Toine/JUV-5802-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,52

This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events-and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.","10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177","102177","0306-4573","1873-5371","WOS:000510524700018","lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023 ","Liu, Zixuan/0000-0003-1778-3112",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,58

Although aggregate metrics on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little about how information spreads on online social networks. Health information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola messages.MethodsOur data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user, disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting patterns.ResultsOn average, 91\% of the retweets were directly retweeted from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5\% of the retweeting paths of the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers via influential and hidden influential users.ConclusionsBroadcasting was the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the message across, because influential and hidden influential users can reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users.","10.1186/s12889-019-6747-8","438","1471-2458",NA,"WOS:000465914900004","Liang, Hai/AAB-2150-2020 Liang, Hai/F-3797-2015 Meltzer, Martin/AAT-3235-2021 Fu, King-wa/A-2385-2010 Fu, King-wa/GLT-7841-2022 ","Liang, Hai/0000-0003-1779-9552 Liang, Hai/0000-0003-1779-9552 Meltzer, Martin/0000-0002-7250-0472 Fu, King-wa/0000-0001-8157-5276 Fu, King-wa/0000-0001-8157-5276 Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai/0000-0001-5496-2529 Tse, Zion/0000-0001-9741-1137",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,59

Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed methodology approach to analyze tweets with COVID-19-related hashtags. First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify social media users who initiate the information diffusion process, followed by a quantitative content analysis of tweets by users with more than 5K retweets to identify what COVID-19 claims, factual information, misinformation and disinformation was shared on Twitter. Findings Results - found very little misinformation and disinformation distributed widely. While health experts and journalists shared factual COVID-19-related information, they were not receiving optimum engagement. Tweets by citizens focusing on personal experience or opinions received more retweets and likes compared to any other sender type. Similarly, celebrities received more replies than any other sender type.

In addition to scientific efforts, political efforts and public administration are also crucial to contain the disease. Therefore, understanding how multi-level governance systems respond to this public health crisis is vital to combat COVID-19. This study focuses on China and applies social network analysis to illustrate interactive governance between and within levels and functions of government, confirming and extending the existing Type I and Type II definition of multi-level governance theory. We characterize four interaction patterns-vertical, inter-functional, intra-functional, and hybrid-with the dominant pattern differing across governmental functions and evolving as the pandemic progressed. Empirical results reveal that financial departments of different levels of government interact through the vertical pattern. At the same time, intra-functional interaction also exists in provincial financial departments. The supervision departments typically adopt the inter-functional pattern at all levels. At the cross-level and cross-function aspects, the hybrid interaction pattern prevails in the medical function and plays a fair part in the security, welfare, and economic function. This study is one of the first to summarize the interaction patterns in a multi-level setting, providing practical implications for which pattern should be applied to which governmental levels/functions under what pandemic condition.","10.1177/02750740211059534","02750740211059534","0275-0740","1552-3357","WOS:000730231500001","chen, yijing/HLQ-6732-2023 Yan, Wenhong/HHC-8727-2022 ","Yan, Wenhong/0000-0001-9557-5007 Li, Jing/0000-0002-9864-6269","DEC 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63

Data Sources We used 2018 National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems data, a nationally representative cohort of the US public health systems. Study Design Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of tribal organization participation in public health networks and to understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574 respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of 258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services participating in the network and the scope of public health activities implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of tribal organizations remains low.","10.1111/1475-6773.14012",NA,"0017-9124","1475-6773","WOS:000806587300001",NA,"Owsley, Kelsey/0000-0002-3745-4976 Bauer, Kyla/0000-0003-0074-6374","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,64

Families consisting of child (aged 9-11 years), mother, and father were recruited from colonias on the Texas-Mexico border for participation in a 6-week father-focused, family-centered program concentrated on healthy eating and active living. Fathers reported up to 5 people with whom they were active most in the previous month before and after the program as well as how often they were active with the person and what activities they did most often. Multilevel regression models examined changes in networks. Fathers (n = 42; mean age = 39.07 years, SD = 7.45) were significantly more likely to report more frequent PA with others after the program as compared with before. General active play and conditional support were mentioned most frequently. This study provides context to the social networks and PA behaviors of Mexican-heritage fathers and suggests that a father-focused, family-centered health program can increase the PA frequency with social network connections.","10.1097/FCH.0000000000000319",NA,"0160-6379","1550-5057","WOS:000757900700007","Patterson, Megan S/U-5546-2018 Talbert, Tony L/D-6483-2015","Talbert, Tony L/0000-0003-4328-7526",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,67

Detection of these groups can be helpful in many applications, such as finding networks of protein interaction in biological networks, finding the users of similar mind for ads and suggestions, finding a shared research field in collaborative networks, analyzing public health, future link prediction in social networks, analyzing criminology, and many more. However, with the increase in the number of profiles and content shared on social media platforms, the analysis is often time-consuming and exhaustive. In order to speed up and optimize the community detection process, parallel processing and Shared/Distributed memory techniques are widely used. Despite community detection has widespread use in social networks, no attempt has ever been made to compile and systematically discuss research efforts on the emerging subject of identifying parallel and distributed methods for community detection in social networks. Most of the surveys described the serial algorithms used for community detection. Our survey work comes under the scope of new design techniques, exciting or novel applications, components or standards, and applications of an educational, transactional, and co-operational nature. This paper accommodates and presents a systematic literature review with state-of-the-art research on the application of parallel processing and Shared/Distributed techniques to determine communities for social network analysis. Advanced search strategy has been performed on several digital libraries for extracting several studies for the review. The systematic search landed in finding 3220 studies, among which 65 relevant studies are selected after conducting various screening phases for further review. The application of parallel computing, shared memory, and distributed memory on the existing community detection methodologies have been discussed thoroughly. More specifically, the central significance of this paper is that a systematic literature review is conducted to gather the relevant studies from different digital libraries and gray literature. Then, different parametric values of each selected study are appropriately compared. Moreover, the need for further research to speed up the process of community formation in parallel and shared approaches has been pinpointed more suitably.

Industry funding is contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network analysis. Methods We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of funding, and THR stance. Results About 284 (20\%) out of 1405 authors were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors. E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association with undisclosed industry support. Conclusions Authors with industry support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be necessary to achieve funding parity.","10.1093/ntr/ntac250",NA,"1462-2203","1469-994X","WOS:000885661300001","Hendlin, Yogi/Q-9777-2019 ","Hendlin, Yogi/0000-0002-1714-6132 Vassey, Julia/0000-0003-3002-2000","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,74

The structure of their information exchange networks may influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021. As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of connections, density and centralization for each of the health conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in primary care practices. Results: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17 for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members. Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with nurses and pharmacists. Conclusions: This study identified four types of information exchange structures, which provides a practical tool for management and improvement in primary care.

This study particularly focuses on the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The data for the study were collected through a content analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak period.

Thus, equitable access to vaccine products is essential to ensure global human health. Based on the global vaccine product trade data from 2000 to 2018 and employing social network analysis, this paper explores the unbalanced pattern of global vaccine product trade and assesses the sensitivity interdependence between countries. Overall, the analysis shows that global vaccine product trade links have long been highly concentrated within developed countries in Europe and America. Nevertheless, with the rise of global and regional hub countries, the global vaccine product trade network has begun to evolve from a unipolar structure with the U.S. as the sole core to a multipolar structure with the U.S. and Western European countries as the core. Meanwhile, emerging countries, represented by China and India, are increasingly participating in the global vaccine product trade network and are beginning to play an important role. The formation of this multipolar pattern has provided countries in the Global South with more options for cooperation in the vaccine product trade and reduces the sensitivity inter-dependence of network periphery countries on core countries, which consequently reduces the global supply risk of vaccine products.","10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115913","115913","0277-9536","1873-5347","WOS:000985849800001",NA,NA,"APR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90

This article addresses the question of how networks of Australian health professionals engaged with COVID-19 facts and myths on Twitter between August and October 2020. After reviewing selected literature on COVID-19 misinformation, we present our analytical choices and the methodology we used to constitute datasets of COVID-19 factual and mythical hashtags and of verified Australian health professional accounts (N:377). The article distinguishes between the capacities of `actor-actants' and `issue-actants,' and between the adoption of `field' and `contested' hashtags during a controversy. We identify categories of Australian health professional Twitter accounts such as GPs, nurses, specialists, public health professionals and researchers, and analyse the patterns of connections between these actor-actants and COVID-19 facts and myths. We find that these categories exhibit clearly distinct behaviour when tweeting or retweeting factual and mythical hashtags. Even though the rate of Australian health professionals' connection with myths in comparison to facts on Twitter is low, hashtags such as \#hydroxychloroquine attracted significant engagement. We examine these hashtags' context and find that they were mainly being debunked, though a minority of accounts endorsed them. We analyse these adoption patterns, and critically assess the `echo chamber effect.' We also consider public health and privacy implications for the dissemination of accurate information, for trust in health professionals during a pandemic, and for combatting misinformation.","10.1080/1369118X.2022.2032260",NA,"1369-118X","1468-4462","WOS:000753311300001","Cai, Xiaolan/HZH-9596-2023 ","Cai, Xiaolan/0000-0002-1708-7304 Khan, Md Irfanuzzaman/0000-0003-2671-7053 Holland, Kate/0000-0003-3873-5769 O'Neil, Mathieu/0000-0002-3537-9036","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,92

This study applied social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2), dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3, Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4, standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents with less pain problems.

During these times of uncertainty and crisis, people have turned to social media platforms as communication tools and primary information sources. Online discourse is conducted under the influence of many different factors, such as background, culture, politics, etc. However, parallel comparative research studies conducted in different countries to identify similarities and differences in online discourse are still scarce. In this study, we combine the crisis lifecycle and opinion leader concepts and use data mining and a set of predefined search terms (coronavirus and COVID-19) to investigate discourse on Twitter (101,271 tweets) and Sina Weibo (92,037 posts). Then, we use a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the most common issues posted by users and temporal analysis to research the issue's trend. Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to discover the opinion leader on the two different platforms. Finally, we find that online discourse reflects the crisis lifecycle according to the stage of COVID-19 in China and the US. Regarding the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, users of Twitter tend to pay more attention to the economic situation while users of Weibo pay more attention to public health. The issues focused on in online discourse have a strong relationship with the development of the crisis in different countries.

Some researchers anticipate benefits stemming from improved public awareness of the value of vaccines while others worry concerns around vaccine development and public health mandates may have damaged public trust. There is a need to understand whether the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine mandates have influenced HPV vaccine attitudes and sentiments to inform health communication strategies.MethodsWe collected 596,987 global English-language tweets from January 2019-May 2021 using Twitter's Academic Research Product track. We determined vaccine confident and hesitant networks discussing HPV immunization using social network analysis. Then, we used a neural network approach to natural language processing to measure narratives and sentiment pertaining to HPV immunization.ResultsMost of the tweets in the vaccine hesitant network were negative in tone (54.9\%) and focused on safety concerns surrounding the HPV vaccine while most of the tweets in the vaccine confident network were neutral (51.6\%) and emphasized the health benefits of vaccination. Growth in negative sentiment among the vaccine hesitant network corresponded with legislative efforts in the State of New York to mandate HPV vaccination for public school students in 2019 and the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a Global Health Emergency in 2020. In the vaccine confident network, the number of tweets concerning the HPV vaccine decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic but in both vaccine hesitant and confident networks, the sentiments, and themes of tweets about HPV vaccine were unchanged.ConclusionsAlthough we did not observe a difference in narratives or sentiments surrounding the HPV vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased focus on the HPV vaccine among vaccine confident groups. As routine vaccine catch-up programs restart, there is a need to invest in health communication online to raise awareness about the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine.","10.1186/s12889-023-15615-w","694",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000969776100001","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/JLK-8537-2023 ","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/0000-0002-2755-7891 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96

The calculation of this parameter is a challenge for epidemiologists, since transmission can occur through multiple pathways. The social network analysis is a widely used tool in epidemiology due to its capacity to identify individuals and communities with relevant roles for pathogen transmission. In the present work, we studied the dynamic network of interactions in a complex epidemiological scenario using information from different methodologies. In 2015, nine red deer, seven fallow deer, six wild boar and nine cattle were simultaneously monitored using GPS-GSM-Proximity collars in Donana National Park. In addition, 16 proximity loggers were set in aggregation points. Using the social network analysis, we studied the dynamic network of interactions, including direct and indirect interactions, between individuals of different species and the potential transmission of pathogens within this network. The results show a high connection between species through indirect interactions, with a marked seasonality in the conformation of new interactions. Within the network, we differentiated four communities that included individuals of all the species. Regarding the transmission of pathogens, we observed the important role that fallow deer could be playing in the maintenance and transmission of pathogens to livestock. The present work shows the need to consider different types of methodologies in order to understand the complete functioning of the network of interactions at the wildlife/livestock interface. It also provides a methodological approach applicable to the management of shared diseases.","10.3390/pathogens9020120","120",NA,"2076-0817","WOS:000519242900017","MartÃ­nez-LÃ³pez, Beatriz/HTQ-2159-2023 Lopez, Beatriz Martinez/AAE-6692-2021 Martinez-Guijosa, Jordi/AAG-5843-2019 Vicente, JoaquÃ­n/K-7822-2013 Barasona, Jose/ABH-7368-2020 Triguero, Roxana/JZT-4481-2024 Acevedo, Pelayo/L-6737-2013 ","Martinez-Guijosa, Jordi/0000-0002-9553-7673 Barasona, Jose/0000-0003-4066-8454 Acevedo, Pelayo/0000-0002-3509-7696 Triguero Ocana, Roxana/0000-0003-4875-4306",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,97

The present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61 network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to examine network properties and exponential random graph models were estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the community department for education and sports being the most central network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in both the present and other research areas of health promotion.","10.1371/journal.pone.0260053","e0260053","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000755305800089",NA,"Wolbring, Laura/0000-0001-9596-1119 Woll, Alexander/0000-0002-5736-2980",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,98

Results and conclusions A total of 58.48\% of rural adolescents consumed alcohol compared to 49.52\% of urban adolescents. These results demonstrate that adolescents who live in rural areas exhibit a greater risk of drinking alcohol than those who live in urban areas. The presence of transitive triads increases the probability of sharing sociodemographic attributes in such a way that it may be considered one of the causes of homophily, contributing to adolescents taking greater risks, such as consuming alcohol.","10.1371/journal.pone.0241135","e0241135","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000588375500021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,101

To date, however, the socioecological factors that determine whether, when or where wild animals take risks by interacting with humans and anthropogenic factors still remains unclear. We adopt a comparative approach to address this gap, using social network analysis (SNA). SNA, increasingly implemented to determine human impact on wildlife ecology, can be a powerful tool to understand how animal socioecology influences the spatiotemporal distribution of human-wildlife interactions. For 10 groups of rhesus, long-tailed and bonnet macaques (Macaca spp.) living in anthropogenically impacted environments in Asia, we collected data on human-macaque interactions, animal demographics, and macaque-macaque agonistic and affiliative social interactions. We constructed `human co-interaction networks' based on associations between macaques that interacted with humans within the same time and spatial locations, and social networks based on macaque-macaque allogrooming behaviour, affiliative behaviours of short duration (agonistic support, lip-smacking, silent bare-teeth displays and non-sexual mounting) and proximity. Pre-network permutation tests revealed that, within all macaque groups, specific individuals jointly took risks by repeatedly, consistently co-interacting with humans within and across time and space. GLMMs revealed that macaques' tendencies to co-interact with humans was positively predicted by their tendencies to engage in short-duration affiliative interactions and tolerance of conspecifics, although the latter varied across species (bonnets>rhesus>long-tailed). Male macaques were more likely to co-interact with humans than females. Neither macaques' grooming relationships nor their dominance ranks predicted their tendencies to co-interact with humans. Our findings suggest that, in challenging anthropogenic environments, less (compared to more) time-consuming forms of affiliation, and additionally greater social tolerance in less ecologically flexible species with a shorter history of exposure to humans, may be key to animals' joint propensities to take risks to gain access to resources. For males, greater exploratory tendencies and less energetically demanding long-term life-history strategies (compared to females) may also influence such joint risk-taking. From conservation and public health perspectives, wildlife connectedness within such co-interaction networks may inform interventions to mitigate zoonosis, and move human-wildlife interactions from conflict towards coexistence.","10.1111/1365-2656.13584",NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656","WOS:000692924900001","Ruppert, Nadine/D-7085-2016 Kaburu, Stefano Seraph Kiambi/H-8523-2013 Kodandaramaiah, Ullasa/B-9683-2009","Ruppert, Nadine/0000-0002-9760-0058 ","SEP 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,104

The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help ``prove{''} that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.","10.1177/2053951720938405","2053951720938405","2053-9517",NA,"WOS:000554923700001",NA,"Mai, Philip/0000-0002-6950-1220 Gruzd, Anatoliy/0000-0003-2366-5163",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,106

Implementing policies to cope with this challenge requires commitment from all stakeholders at various levels, and all necessary resources should be mobilised. Support for various HCV-related stakeholders can reduce the challenges and obstacles that can be encountered during the programme implementation. The present study aims to identify all stakeholders involved with HCV-related policy-making in Iran at different steps (policy development, implementation and evaluation) and to characterise them in terms of interest, position, power and influence, in order to provide valuable information for appropriate decision-making and design. The present study can also serve as a case study for healthcare systems in other countries. Method: An approach based on social network analysis was utilised. Data collected included relevant document searches and in-depth interviews to a sample of 18 key informants. Results: Various stakeholders were found to be involved with HCV-related policies in Iran. The extent of their participation and support in policy-making varied. Specifically, international agencies had a high interest for HCV-related policy-making, whereas media and members of the private sector were characterised by a medium interest and governmental and non-governmental bodies by a highly variable interest, ranging from low to high, depending on the specific organism. Moreover, media and members of the private sector, non-governmental institutions and international agencies were rated low in terms of position, whereas governmental actors were rated low to high. Media were rated medium in terms of power, whereas international agencies and members of the private sector were respectively rated low to medium and low. Non-governmental actors were rated low, whilst governmental bodies were rated low to high. Finally, media, members of the private sector and international agencies were rated medium in terms of influence, whereas non-governmental and governmental actors were respectively rated low to medium and low to high. Conclusion: Policy-making involves trust, negotiation and integration of the different views of all stakeholders. Social network analysis was critical for identifying stakeholders and showing that, in Iran, involvement in HCV-related policy-making is generally low. This information is of practical implication for policy- and decision-makers regarding the adoption of more favourable and effective strategies.","10.1186/s12961-019-0442-1","42","1478-4505",NA,"WOS:000464886400001","Abolghasem Gorji, Hassan/JVZ-4108-2024 Rezvanian, Alireza/B-1604-2012 Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/G-1672-2011 Vatankhah, Soudabeh/Y-4611-2019 rezapour, aziz/M-2817-2018 Behzadifar, Masoud/H-1433-2016","Abolghasem Gorji, Hassan/0000-0002-6328-1925 Rezvanian, Alireza/0000-0003-3323-7832 Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/0000-0001-8409-868X Vatankhah, Soudabeh/0000-0002-4277-9484 Behzadifar, Masoud/0000-0002-0271-4360",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,108

The Syrian migrants experience multiple uncertainties in their daily lives which are further compounded by multifaceted challenges of the post-disaster environment. Social media was used intensively and with impunity in this environment and thereby provides a window into the explicit and implicit dynamics of daily life after a disaster. We aimed to explore how a post-disaster environment potentially generates new uncertainties or exacerbating pre-existing ones for migrants through social media analysis with an indirect perspective, in the context of 2023-Earthquake in Turkiye and Syrian migrants. MethodsSocial network analysis was used to analyze Twitter-data with the hashtags `Syrian' and `earthquake' during a 10-day period beginning on March 22nd, 2023. We calculated network metrics, including degree-values and betweenness-centrality and clustered the network to understand groups. We analyzed a combination of 27 tweets with summative content analysis using a text analysis tool, to identify the most frequently used words. We identified the main points of each tweet and assessed these as possible contributors to post-disaster uncertainty among migrants by using inductive reasoning. ResultsThere were 1918 Twitter users, 274 tweets, 124 replies and 1726 mentions. Discussions about Syrian migrants and earthquakes were established across various groups (n(groups(edges > 15)) = 16). Certain users had a greater influence on the overall network. The nine most frequently used words were included under uncertainty-related category (n(most\_frequently\_used\_words) = 20); `aid, vote, house, citizen, Afghan, illegal, children, border, and leave'. Nine main points were identified as possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants. ConclusionThe post-disaster environment has the potential to exacerbate existing uncertainties, such as being an undocumented migrant, concerns about deportation and housing, being or having a child, inequality of rights between being a citizen and non-citizen, being in minority within minority, political climate of the host nation and access to education or to generate new ones such equitable distribution of aid, which can lead to poor health outcomes. Recognizing the possible post-disaster uncertainties among migrants and addressing probable underlying factors might help to build more resilient and healthy communities.","10.3389/fpubh.2023.1204589","1204589",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:001044932900001","Aktuna, Gamze/A-1491-2019","Aktuna, Gamze/0000-0003-4575-7763",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,110

Social network analysis (SNA) generates data on hyperlocal social-demographic structures that contribute to disease transmission.MethodsWe collected social contact data in five villages and built SNA-informed village-specific stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar. A name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and individual-level characteristics determining contact formation and structure were identified by fitting an exponential random graph model (ERGM), which formed the basis of the contact structure and model dynamics. Models were calibrated and used to evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and community resiliency to foreign TB introduction.ResultsInter- and intra-village SNA showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with transitivity (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43. Active case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and without specific interventions, networks A and B showed resilience to both active and latent TB reintroduction, while Network C, the village network with the highest transitivity, lacked resiliency to reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence of 2\% and a TB mortality rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one new contagious infection post hypothetical elimination.ConclusionIn remote Madagascar, SNA-informed models suggest that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease (active TB) prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB) burden remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down{'' population level TB models would most likely miss this difference between small communities. SNA bridges large-scale population-based and hyper focused community-level TB modeling.","10.1186/s12889-023-16425-w","1511",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:001044403900001",NA,"Hazel, Ashley/0000-0001-7680-5460 Pando, Christine/0000-0003-1652-6819",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,112

Thus, in many cases there is a journey to overdose. Methods: We applied geospatial analysis to examine characteristics that define journeys to overdoses using Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a diverse and segregated metropolitan area in which 26.72 \% of overdose deaths are geographically discordant, as a case study. First, we deployed spatial social network analysis to identify hubs (census tracts that are focal points of geographically discordant overdoses) and authorities (the communities of residence from which journeys to overdose commonly begin) for overdose deaths and characterized them ac-cording to key demographics. Second, we used temporal trend analysis to identify communities that were consistent, sporadic, and emergent hotspots for overdose deaths. Third, we identified characteristics that differentiated discordant versus non-discordant overdose deaths. Results: Authority communities had lower housing stability and were younger, more impoverished, and less educated relative to hubs and county-wide numbers. White communities were more likely to be hubs, while Hispanic communities were more likely to be authorities. Geographically discordant deaths more commonly involved fentanyl, cocaine, and amphetamines and were more likely to be accidental. Non-discordant deaths more commonly involved opioids other than fentanyl or heroin and were more likely to be the result of suicide. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine the journey to overdose and demonstrates that such analysis can be applied in metropolitan areas to better understand and guide community responses.","10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.109827","109827","0376-8716","1879-0046","WOS:000950581700001","Mantsch, John R/N-1515-2017 Mantsch, John/O-9460-2014","Forati, Amir Masoud/0000-0002-6461-5448 Mantsch, John/0000-0003-0099-1599","MAR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,116

This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets. Reducing violence in the lives of homeless youth is imperative and can contribute to a young person's ability to safely and successfully exit the streets and lead a long and productive life in society. However, developing public health and social interventions to reduce violence in adolescent and young adult populations is difficult due to the complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of this phenomenon. Los Angeles area homeless youth (N = 366) were asked questions regarding recent violence experiences, emotion regulation, and their social network. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the overall effect of emotion regulation on violence, controlling for age, gender, race, sexual identity, experience of childhood abuse, and data collection site. In this sample, 56\% of youth endorsed fighting in the previous year, and those who reported more difficulties with emotion regulation were significantly more likely to fight. In addition, youth who scored below the mean on difficulties with regulation and belonged to networks characterized by low-difficulty peers were 60\% less likely to report fighting. Emotion regulation skills represent a malleable target for intervention that may contribute to reduced propensity for violence in this population. Implications for network-based interventions to improve individual emotion regulation and reduce overall violence among homeless youth and other at-risk populations are discussed.","10.1177/0886260518804183",NA,"0886-2605","1552-6518","WOS:000660076900014",NA,"Barr, Nicholas/0000-0002-5167-9012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,119

To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. The low-carbon patent application is an important means to achieve these goals and promote public health. MethodsThis study analyzes the basic situation, spatial network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database. ResultsThe following findings are established. (1) From the number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing. (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including economic development, financial support, local scientific research level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level, the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban agglomerations.

This study examines a subject directory system related to Mental Health in the MedlinePlus portal and provides suggestions of optimisation to enhance the subject directory system. Method. A mixed research method combining social network analysis and inferential statistics was applied. Analysis. A structural and a semantic social network were built regarding the selected health topics related to mental health in the MedlinePlus portal. The two networks were compared and the outcomes were evaluated by domain experts. Results. Among the ninety-nine collected health topics related to mental health, three themes were identified through the visualisation analysis regarding grouped health topics. Patterns and characteristics of each theme group were discussed. As a result, fifty-five bidirectional and twenty-three unidirectional edges were identified and recommended to be added to the corresponding health topic pages. The recommended results indicate that the subject directory of specific mental health related topics is well constructed, while health consumer groups related topics might need more improvements. The optimised subject directory has significantly stronger semantic connection, and the results of the recommendations are consistent with the evaluation outcome of two domain experts. Conclusions. The findings of this study can provide ideas of optimising and enhancing the subject directory system to the public health portal creators and health professionals, and benefit health consumers for seeking health information online. The methodologies applied in this study may provide a novel way to investigate and enhance subject directories in general.","10.47989/irpaper876","876","1368-1613",NA,"WOS:000611778100039","zhu, yifan/JMR-2845-2023 Zhu, Yifan/GXH-6179-2022 ","Zhu, Yifan/0000-0002-3622-2858",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,122

Mathematical models of transmission used to predict the impact of control measures, such as vaccination and testing, commonly depend on self-reported contact data. However, the link between self-reported social contacts and pathogen transmission has not been well described. To address this, we used Staphylococcus aureus as a model organism to track transmission within two secondary schools in England and test for associations between self-reported social contacts, test positivity and the bacterial strain collected from the same students. Students filled out a social contact survey and their S. aureus colonization status was ascertained through self-administered swabs from which isolates were sequenced. Isolates from the local community were also sequenced to assess the representativeness of school isolates. A low frequency of genome-linked transmission precluded a formal analysis of links between genomic and social networks, suggesting that S. aureus transmission within schools is too rare to make it a viable tool for this purpose. Whilst we found no evidence that schools are an important route of transmission, increased colonization rates found within schools imply that school -age children may be an important source of community transmission.","10.1099/mgen.0.000993","000993","2057-5858",NA,"WOS:000974293800001","Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011 Holmes, Mark/JVO-1478-2024 ","Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958 Bellis, Katherine L/0000-0001-5368-7027 Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-5454-1625 Aggarwal, Dinesh/0000-0002-5938-8172",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,127

Method: This exploratory study evaluated Metadata to find academic publications. Meleis's Transition Theory was selected as a case study. A majority of the publications that represented the transition theory were assigned as the core of the theory. Forward and backward citations were used as agents of knowledge linkage to determine the dissemination of the theory in the field of science. Social network analysis and visualization were used to depict graphical and structural relations of the research front and the knowledge base.

May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month.

However, programs to promote PA among BCS tailored to real-world contexts within low- to middle-income countries are limited. Cross-sector co-creation can be key to effective and scalable programs for BCS in these countries. This study aimed to evaluate the networking process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation of a PA program for Colombian BCS called My Body. We employed a mixed-methods design including semistructured interviews, workshops and a social network analysis of centrality measures to assess stakeholders' engagement, resources and skills enabling the collaborative work, challenges, outcomes and lessons learned. The descriptive analysis and the centrality measures of the network revealed that 19 cross-sector stakeholders engaged in the My Body collaborative network. Through ongoing communication and cooperation, My Body built relationships between the academic lead institutions (local and international), and local and national public, private and academic institutions working in public health, sports and recreation, social sciences and engineering fields. The outcomes included the co-creation of the community-based PA program for BCS, its implementation through cross-sector synergies, increased relationships and communications among stakeholders, and successful dissemination of evidence and project results to the collaboration partners and other relevant stakeholders and community members. The mixed-methods assessment enabled understanding of ways to advance cross-sector co-creation of health promotion programs. The findings can help to enable continued development of sustainable cross-sector co-creation processes aimed at advancing PA promotion. Lay Summary Collaborative work among stakeholders and researchers from different governmental sectors and disciplinary fields can be key to design and implement effective and scalable programs to promote physical activity (PA) among breast cancer survivors (BCS). This might be particularly critical in low- to middle-income countries where the implementation of evidence-based health-promoting programs tailored to real-world contexts are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the networking process to engage multisector stakeholders in the co-creation of a PA program for Colombian BCS. We employed qualitative methods and social network analyses to assess stakeholders' engagement, resources and skills enabling the collaborative work, challenges, outcomes and lessons learned. The co-creation of the program improved synergies between research, policy and practice. Communication through several channels including e-mail and workshops was the key resource to advance the collaborative work. Stakeholders underscored that cross-sector networking allowed allocating resources and achieving shared goals. Sustainable cross-sector collaborative processes are key for health promotion.","10.1093/heapro/daac073","daac073","0957-4824","1460-2245","WOS:000827235500001","Jaramillo, Ana Maria/AAR-8244-2021 Montes, Felipe/AAV-3051-2020 Rubio, Maria Alejandra/R-7821-2018","Jaramillo, Ana Maria/0000-0003-2409-3064 Montes, Felipe/0000-0002-9923-4004 Goldman Rosas, Lisa/0000-0003-4053-7972 King, Abby/0000-0002-7949-8811 Blanco, Martha Maria/0000-0001-8358-2058 Rubio, Maria Alejandra/0000-0002-1133-4466",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,141

To effectively harness promising new technologies and address these and other public health challenges ahead, public health professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting and improving public health. This project sought to understand the network of health departments and organizations that provide training in order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby strengthening the public health system. Design/Setting/Participants: We conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting Region V of the Department of Health \& Human Services. The survey focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics to examine the network. Results: Of 290 participating health departments (58\% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248 LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10 national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected to the state health department for training than to any other organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with its number of training connections. Conclusions: State health departments may benefit from the support of universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs. Additional qualitative information from local and state health departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations to participate in training local practitioners to improve LHD capacity.","10.1097/PHH.0000000000001274",NA,"1078-4659","1550-5022","WOS:000720458700051","Harris, Jenine K/B-8939-2008 Leider, Jonathon/GRJ-6429-2022","Leider, Jonathon/0000-0001-9905-476X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,142

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. Methods In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. Results A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. Conclusion Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as usual.","10.5888/pcd18.200536","200536","1545-1151",NA,"WOS:000626189400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,145

While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients, healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively. This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics models and agent-based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods into the population oral health sciences.","10.1111/cdoe.12824",NA,"0301-5661","1600-0528","WOS:000928837400001",NA,"Baker, Sarah/0000-0002-2861-451X","FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,146

The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55\%). Backyard producers made up 89\% of the network premises, and the top 2\% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50\% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to improve its procedures and update the disease control and management policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based surveillance.","10.1111/tbed.14640",NA,"1865-1674","1865-1682","WOS:000825780500001","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Grisi-Filho, Jose/J-2523-2012 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 Ferreira, Fernando/C-9038-2013 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Amaku, Marcos/0000-0003-4752-6774 Grisi-Filho, Jose/0000-0002-3263-2147 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353 Pisuna Torres, Luis Enrique/0000-0002-1272-3981 Vinueza, Rommel Lenin/0000-0002-4587-8795 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Ferreira, Fernando/0000-0002-9160-7355 ardila galvis, jason/0000-0003-2811-7684","JUL 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,149

This is demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service, funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A description of the system thinking methodology and its associated methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft system methodology are described with examples in the health care setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However, many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care. Conclusion: It is important that methods to implement systems thinking methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.","10.1097/XEB.0000000000000303",NA,"2691-3321",NA,"WOS:000783723400002","khalil, hanan/AAX-4188-2021","khalil, hanan/0000-0002-3302-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,154

One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality -in terms of the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of social integration (eigenvector) -was linked to parasite infection intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.","10.7717/peerj.14305","e14305","2167-8359",NA,"WOS:000965008100001","MacIntosh, Andrew/B-2242-2013","Castellano-Navarro, Alba/0000-0001-7608-2776 MacIntosh, Andrew/0000-0002-9136-7099",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,155

Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105415","105415","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000675466300004","Fowler, James H/C-2750-2008 ","Witte, Carmel/0000-0001-9086-3333","JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,158

However, conventional prevention and control strategies, which only rely on formal organizations, inefficiently decrease the number of infections. Thus, a multi-organization management mode is needed for pandemic prevention. In this paper, we applied a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to analyze how these social organizations cooperate with others and further identify the mechanism that drives them to create a reliable and sustainable cooperative relationship network from the perspective of social network analysis. The model allowed us to assess the effects of the actor's attributes, the network structure, and dynamic cooperative behavior in RSiena with longitudinal data collected from 220 participants in 19 social organizations. The results indicated that the number of cooperative relationships increased during the pandemic, from 44 to 162, which means the network between social organizations became more reliable. Furthermore, all the hypotheses set in four sub-models were significant (t-ratio < 0.1, overall max t-ratio < 0.25, and e/s > 2). Additionally, the estimated values showed that four factors played a positive role in forming the cooperative relationship network, i.e., all except the ``same age group effect (-1.02){''}. The results also indicated that the social organizations tend to build relationships with more active actors in the community in every time period.

By using accurate narratives, both online and offline, we can motivate communities to follow preventive measures and shape attitudes toward them. However, the abundance of misinformation stories can lead to vaccine hesitancy, obstructing the timely implementation of preventive measures, such as vaccination. Therefore, it is crucial to create appropriate and community-centered solutions based on regional data analysis to address mis/disinformation narratives and implement effective countermeasures specific to the particular geographic area. In this case study, we have attempted to create a research pipeline to analyze local narratives on social media, particularly Twitter, to identify misinformation spread locally, using the state of Pennsylvania as an example. Our proposed methodology pipeline identifies main communication trends and misinformation stories for the major cities and counties in southwestern PA, aiming to assist local health officials and public health specialists in instantly addressing pandemic communication issues, including misinformation narratives. Additionally, we investigated anti-vax actors' strategies in promoting harmful narratives. Our pipeline includes data collection, Twitter influencer analysis, Louvain clustering, BEND maneuver analysis, bot identification, and vaccine stance detection. Public health organizations and community-centered entities can implement this data-driven approach to health communication to inform their pandemic strategies.","10.1080/10810730.2023.2217102",NA,"1081-0730","1087-0415","WOS:001021766100010","Alieva, Iuliia/ABA-7423-2021 ","Alieva, Iuliia/0000-0001-6270-8985 Carley, Kathleen M./0000-0002-6356-0238",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166

It is an urgent problem to be solved for firms how to make use of internal knowledge and external power to help firms' sustainable innovation (FSI). Thus, the purpose of this study is to deeply analyze how firms' internal knowledge diversity (KD) and external ego-network structures {[}ego-network density (ED) and honest brokers (HB)] affect FSI, as well as how the ego-network structures (ED and HB) moderate the relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of the ego network. Design/methodology/approachBased on the data of the alliance innovation networks of China's new energy industries in 2009-2019, this study uses the social network analysis method and negative binomial regression model to explore the effect of KD and ego-network structures (ED and HB) on FSI, as well as the moderating effects of ego-network structures (ED and HB) on the relationship between KD and FSI based on the perspective of ego network. FindingsThis study finds that KD, ED and HB can boost FSI. Moreover, ED plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between KD and FSI. However, the negative moderating effect of HB on the relationship between KD and FSI is not significant. Research limitations/implicationsThis study presents fresh empirical evidence and new insights for firms on how to make full use of firms' internal KD and external ego-network structures to facilitate FSI. Originality/valueFirst, this study not only enriches the research on the consequences of KD but also expands our understanding of the knowledge-based view to some extent. Second, this study not only enriches the motivation research of the FSI based on the perspective of ego-network in the context of the GPHE but also expands the application scope of social network theory and sustainable innovation' theory in part.

To date, no network of a health-promoting university has been examined regarding the processes underlying tie formation, network emergence, and maintenance.Objectives and methods The goals of this study are to obtain insight into the mechanisms of cooperation between university actors in a health-promoting network and to identify the structural and attributive factors associated with establishing cooperation between actors in the observed network in order to better understand how to build and develop successful networks in the future. For this purpose, a social network analysis was carried out and exponential random graph models were estimated to test corresponding hypotheses.Results The network at hand consists of 33 actors (e.g. University Sports Center, General Student Committee) and shows a flat, non-hierarchical structure. Data reveal that attributed competence predicts cooperation (0.32; p < 0.05). Significant homophily effects among student actors (1.31; p < 0.05) and among university actors (0.59; p < 0.05) were found. All structural predictors examined were significant (0.22-5.40; p < 0.05) and are therefore essential in determining the likelihood of cooperation between actors involved in the network.Conclusion The results of this study provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cooperation and can be used to further develop the network at hand (e.g. selection of key actors for information dissemination or integration of peripheral actors). In addition, the findings offer starting points for sustained network development at other universities (e.g. significance of network governance form or goal consensus). Knowing the factors that influence the network structure, here the conditions of cooperation, results in opportunities to encourage empowerment among actors. However, the analysis of the network undertaken does not directly bear on the success of the network.","10.1186/s12889-023-16786-2","1911",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:001076952500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,168

In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal \& child health (MCH) and water \& sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries. Method An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH. Results Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.","10.1371/journal.pone.0219786","e0219786","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000482331900044","Gupta, Shivam/JNE-3789-2023 ","Adhikari, Binita/0000-0002-7554-2889 Hoe, Connie/0000-0001-8008-4010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,169

Design: This study used a social network analysis (SNA) approach to assess the Million Hearts initiative network partnerships and identify potential implications for policy and practice. Setting/Participants: The Million Hearts network comprised a core group of federal and private sector partners that participate in Million Hearts activities and align with initiative priorities. To bound the network for the SNA, we used a list of 58 organizations (74\% response rate) from a previously completed qualitative analysis of Million Hearts partnerships. Main Outcome Measures: We used the online PARTNER (Program to Analyze Record and Track Networks to Enhance Relationships-) survey to collect data on individual organizational characteristics and relational questions that asked organizations to identify and describe their relationships with other partners in the network. Key SNA measures include network density, centralizations, value, and trust. Results: Our analyses show a network that is decentralized, has strong perceptions of trust and value among its members, and strong agreement on intended outcomes. Interestingly, partners report a desire and ability to contribute resources to Million Hearts; however, the perceptions between partners are that resources are not being contributed at the level they potentially could be. The majority of partners reported that being in the network helped them achieve their goals related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The largest barrier to successful activities within the network was cited as lack of targeted funding and staff to support participation in the network. Conclusions: The Million Hearts network described in this article is unique in its membership at the national level, agreement on outcomes, its powerful information-sharing abilities that require few resources, and its decentralized structure. We identified strategies that could be implemented to strengthen the network and its activities. By examining a national-level public-private partnership formed to address a public health issue, we can identify ways to strengthen the network and provide a framework for developing other initiatives.","10.1097/PHH.0000000000000781",NA,"1078-4659","1550-5022","WOS:000458115900012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170

Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar (a reference area).

Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683","105683","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000833401100005","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Dietze, Klaas/JJF-6743-2023 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Dietze, Klaas/0000-0002-6138-6707 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

To understand the alignment and structure of each network, we measured network density overall and between sectors, network centralization, and each organization's degree centrality and effective size.Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted to document alignment around shared purpose, data, financing, and governance.Principal Findings: On average, overall and cross-sector network densities in both communities were similar. However, alignment was highest for data sharing and financing in the urban community and for shared purpose and governance in the rural community. Cross-sector partnerships involving healthcare organizations were more prevalent in the rural county (44\% vs. 38\% for healthcare/public health, 44\% vs. 29\% for healthcare/social services), but more prevalent for those involving public health/social services organizations in the urban county (42\% vs. 24\%). A single healthcare organization had the highest degree centrality (Mdn {[}IQR] = 26 [}26-9.5]) and effective size (Mdn {[}IQR] = 15.9 {[}20.6-8.7]) within the rural county.

Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. Methods This paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors. Results The results show that commercial actors' positions on e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs, independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Conclusion Awareness of the various commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3.","10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056084",NA,"0964-4563","1468-3318","WOS:000728273000001",NA,"Hilton, Shona/0000-0003-0633-8152 Wong, Mark Tsun On/0000-0002-5683-8684 Buckton, Christina/0000-0002-6004-4334 Ikegwuonu, Theresa/0000-0001-6633-8512 Smith, Katherine/0000-0002-1060-4102","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,179

We first discuss the networks embedded in the parasite life cycle that propagates disease transmission. Then, we collect 820 questionnaires from three provinces in northeast Thailand to visualize their fish-sharing and sharing-procurement networks, analyze how the connectivity differences in these networks might be linked to participants' consumption behaviors and environmental settings, and determine how all these together affect liver fluke infection risks. The results show that infection was positively associated with procuring fish from ponds, but negatively associated with procuring fish from rivers. Incorporating fish procurement sites substantially increases network connectivity, reinforcing the human connection to key fish sources as a potential risk factor for infection. The consideration of the connections between human, disease hosts, and the environment, compared to the previously human-centric approach of deworming, offers new insights for public health intervention.","10.1080/24694452.2023.2277807",NA,"2469-4452","2469-4460","WOS:001138532800001","Sithithaworn, Paiboon/E-4378-2019 ","Sithithaworn, Paiboon/0000-0002-9480-1778 Law, Andrea/0000-0003-3359-3263","NOV 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,185

Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and future developments in this field. Methods: The bibliometric techniques were applied in the analysis of publications on CEPH in Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson Reuters. One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of publications, including distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection, were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and evolution of CEPH. Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic actions. Based on keyword clustering and co-citation clustering, we propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome) framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the future. Conclusion: This study draws an outline of the global review on the contemporary and cross-disciplinary research of CEPH which might present an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are fundamental to inform policy making.","10.1186/s13690-021-00525-3","6","0778-7367","2049-3258","WOS:000609488000001","Lin, Han/X-5326-2019 Wang, Xuemei/GXF-3702-2022 yuan, ming/JPL-4196-2023 Lin, Han/GRF-1081-2022","Lin, Han/0000-0001-5136-5059 ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,186

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compound disasters of public health emergencies, accident disasters, and natural hazards have occurred frequently all over the world; therefore, it is important to establish effective compound disaster emergency collaboration networks. Thus, this study examined the 7 March building collapse in Quanzhou City as a case study. This case was a typical compound disaster involving a public health emergency and an accident disaster during COVID-19. Based on the network analysis, the overall response and dynamic characteristics of the emergency collaboration for compound disasters were examined in this study. A compound disaster emergency collaboration network (ECN) was constructed by identifying the interactional relationships between emergency organizations. After applying time slices, the dynamic evolution of network structure, organizational-functional relations, organizational attributes, and cross-organizational relationships were discussed. The research results showed the following: (1) The density and connectivity of the compound disaster ECN first decreased before increasing. Meanwhile, the evolution of the network structure followed a path from decentralized to concentrated and from being uneven to an equilibrium. (2) The characteristics and practices of compound disasters during different periods indicated varied emergency needs for emergency organizations. We found that the formation of emergency tasks not only involved the passive adaptation to match the practice for compound disasters, but also the active choices of emergency organizations when facing compound disasters according to their collective experiences and decisions. (3) The national emergency management departments, the government emergency rescue organizations, and the local governments were the core organizations of the ECN. Public health management departments and social organizations were also required to participate in the ECN to improve the diverse and heterogeneous distribution of resources. (4) With increased demands during a compound disaster emergency, the number of cross-organizational collaborative relationships gradually increased. This study explored compound disaster emergencies from the perspective of network analysis to improve our understanding of the current and developing organizational relationships and practices during a compound disaster event. The dynamic characteristics of compound disasters require efficient adaptation and improvements of the collaborative mechanisms involved during emergencies.","10.3390/healthcare10030500","500",NA,"2227-9032","WOS:000775264900001",NA,"Dong, Changqi/0000-0002-2806-6824 liu, ji da/0000-0003-2985-5048 Mai, Qiang/0000-0001-8811-0092",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,187

Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.","10.1111/tbed.14351",NA,"1865-1674","1865-1682","WOS:000714419500001","wang, youming/HJB-0541-2022 ","CAI, CHANG/0000-0002-1122-3045 Tang, Hao/0000-0002-3932-4016 Bruce, Mieghan/0000-0003-3176-2094","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,188

Numerous articles related to ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100 most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations. Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100 most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded. Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation coefficients (CC). Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were excluded because they do not have MeSH terms). Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top 100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and other academic disciplines.","10.1186/s12991-021-00329-3","6",NA,"1744-859X","WOS:000609471900001","smile, chien/AAA-1053-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,189

However, 2 challenges arise when conducting such research. First, some authors may have identical names in the study data, and second, the contributions of coauthors may vary in the article by line, requiring consideration. Failure to address these issues may result in biased research findings. Our objective was to illustrate how the author-weighted scheme (AWS) and betweenness centrality (BC) can be employed to identify the 10 most frequently cited authors in a particular journal and analyze their research themes. Methods: We collected 24,058 abstracts from the PubMed library between 2000 and 2020 using the keyword ``Medicine {[}Journal].{''} Author names, countries/regions, and medical subject headings (MeSH terms) were collected. The AWS to identify the top 10 authors with a higher x-index was applied. To address the issue of authors with identical names affiliated with different research institutes, we utilized the BC method. Social network analysis (SNA) was conducted, and 10 major clusters were identified to highlight authors with a higher x-index within the corresponding clusters. We utilized SNA to analyze the MeSH terms from articles of the 10 top-cited authors to identify their research themes.

We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model.

This calls for systems-based approaches that facilitate the kind of collective and collaborative thinking and working required to address complexity. While the literature on systems thinking, system dynamics and the associated methodologies is extensive, there remains little clear guidance on how to plan, govern and implement participatory systems approaches within a co-creation process.MethodsWe used a three-step process to develop DISCOVER, a framework for implementing, and governing systems-based co-creation:Stage 1: We conducted a literature analysis of key texts to identify well-documented methods and phases for co-creation using a systems approach, as well as areas where gaps existed.Stage 2: We looked for the most appropriate methods and approaches to fill the gaps in the knowledge production chain.Stage 3: We developed the framework, identifying how the different tools and approaches fit together end-to-end, from sampling and recruiting participants all the way through to responding with an action plan.ResultsWe devised DISCOVER to help guide researchers and stakeholders to collectively respond to complex social, health and wider problems. DISCOVER is a strategic research planning and governance framework that provides an actionable, systematic way to conceptualise complex problems and move from evidence to action, using systems approaches and co-creation.

Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis. Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0). Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.","10.1093/cid/ciaa420",NA,"1058-4838","1537-6591","WOS:000670819400065","Sharma, Meenu/AAE-2536-2022 Cameron, Bill/E-9180-2010 Sharma, Meenu/GWM-5030-2022 ","Sharma, Meenu/0000-0002-6020-9995 Cameron, Bill/0000-0002-0090-3539 Pakhale, Smita/0000-0002-4051-962X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,207

Throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), children are consuming unhealthy diets, characterized by energy-dense, processed and ultra-processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages, and limited quantities of fruits and vegetables. Community-based school meal programmes (SMPs) have been identified as useful vehicles to address unhealthy eating among children, and ``farm-to-school{''} approaches have the potential to increase the availability of locally grown nutritious produce, while supporting local agriculture and reducing the region's reliance on food imports. This paper seeks to better understand the barriers to enhancing community-based school feeding value-chains in the CARICOM, by focusing on the Eastern Caribbean Island of Nevis where there is an interest in developing farm-to-school value chains. Using key informant interviews combined with focus groups with actors along the local food value chain, we identify the following barriers to an effective community-based SMP: a lack of communication and an absence of contractual agreements between local farmers and the SMP administration; generally low levels of child acceptance of school meals containing fresh vegetables; and limited intersectoral coordination and collaboration among SMP stakeholders and local farmers. Using social network analysis, we further discuss limitations in group organization and coordination among local farmers and opportunities for SMP improvement. The results point to the need for more integrative public policy development and greater community engagement to coordinate and strengthen the farm-to school approach to school feeding.","10.1007/s12571-023-01395-z",NA,"1876-4517","1876-4525","WOS:001070288200001",NA,NA,"SEP 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,208

To date, there is limited evidence on how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and physical activity providers as well as sports administrating organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations; Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central actors (preferential attachment effect).

The scientific aim of this study was to introduce geospatial thinking to research related to infectious diseases, while the practical aim was to explore the impact on population movements and urban linkages in the longer term following a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study took 366 cities in China as the research subjects while exploring the relationship between urban contact and the outbreak of the pandemic from both national and regional perspectives using social network analysis (SNA), Pearson correlation analysis and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) modeling. The results revealed that the number of COVID-19 infections in China fluctuated with strain variation over the study period; the urban contact network exhibited a significant trend of recovery. The pandemic had a hindering effect on national urban contact, and this effect weakened progressively. Meanwhile, the effect exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with a weakening effect in the eastern region \& AP; northeast region > central region > western region, indicating a decreasing phenomenon from coastal to inland areas. Moreover, the four major economic regions in China featured border barrier effects, whereby urban contact networks constituted by cross-regional flows were more sensitive to the development of the pandemic. The geostatistical approach adopted in this study related to infectious disease and urban linkages can be used in other regions, and its findings provide a reference for China and other countries around the world to respond to major public health events.","10.3390/ijgi12060252","252",NA,"2220-9964","WOS:001015242400001","Wang, Yanan/JVZ-7957-2024 wang, xueting/JPY-2782-2023 liu, sha/JXL-6600-2024 lin, yuan/JXL-9592-2024 Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023 Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020 zhao, sheng/JWO-6127-2024 Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023 Liu, Jingyi/JWP-6326-2024 Liu, Liu/JXM-8208-2024 Liu, Haimeng/R-7364-2018","Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017 Miao, Yi/0000-0003-3829-9557 Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,213

Using a modified spatial gravity model, we constructed and analyzed the spatial correlation network of these health resource agglomeration capacities and their influencing factors through social network analysis. We found that: (i) China's health resource agglomeration capacity had a gradual strengthening trend, with capacity weakening from east to west (strongest in the eastern region, second strongest in the central region, and weakest in the western region). (ii) The spatial network of such capacities became more densely connected, and the network density and level (efficiency) showed an upward (downward) trend. (iii) In terms of centrality, the high-ranking provinces (or municipalities) were Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Tianjin, while the low-ranking were Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xinjiang, Hainan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi.

However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S. Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10\% of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread. Author summary Epidemiologists increasingly use social networks to understand how geography, demographics, and human mobility affect disease spread and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. While highly detailed data on human social networks are now available, the size and density of these modern networks makes them computationally intensive to study. To address this challenge, we study methods for reducing a network to its most important links. Following recent work in computer science, we use the effective resistance, which takes both local and global connectivity into account. We test this method in simulations on a U.S.-wide mobility network and find that it preserves epidemic dynamics with high fidelity. Combined with efficient epidemic simulation algorithms, our approach can facilitate a more effective response to epidemics.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010650","e1010650","1553-734X","1553-7358","WOS:000926070200002",NA,"Mercier, Alexander/0000-0001-6295-1416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,220

The authors examined the associations of social isolation and per-ceived loneliness with cognitive performance in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, social isolation was evaluated by a composite score including marital status, social contact, and social support. The dependent variable was global cognitive performance, which considered memory, verbal fluency, and temporal orientation tests. Lin-ear and logistic regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The authors added interaction terms of depressive symptoms with social isolation and loneliness to examine whether depression, measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, modified these associations. Results: Among 6,986 participants (mean age = 62.1 </n> 9.2 years), higher levels of social connections were associated with better global cognitive performance (B = 0.02, 95\%CI: 0.02; 0.04). Perceived loneliness was associated with worse cognition (B = -0.26, 95\%CI = -0.34; -0.18). Interac-tions of depressive symptoms with social connections scores were found on memory z-score and with loneliness on global and memory z-scores, suggesting a weaker association between social isolation or loneliness and cognition among those with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample from an LMIC, social isolation and loneliness were associated with worse cognitive performance. Surprisingly, depressive symptoms decrease the strength of these associations. Future longitudinal studies are important to assess the direction of the association between social isolation and cognitive performance.

The lessons learned from the S\&T response of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focusof patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.","10.1186/s12889-019-6842-x","530",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000467609400002","FONSECA, FERNANDA/HDN-9451-2022 Fonseca, Fernanda/V-3446-2019 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/AAD-8584-2020 ","FONSECA, FERNANDA/0000-0002-0315-6479 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/0000-0002-4135-4011 Guindalini, Camila/0000-0002-6278-5881 Fonseca, Bruna de Paula/0000-0002-8795-2578 Fonseca, Fernanda/0000-0001-6852-6912",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,224

Frailty seems to behave as a network, and in silico evidence is available on this matter. Having in vivo evidence that frailty behaves as a complex network was the main purpose of our study. Methods: Data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (main data 2012, mortality 2015) was used. Frailty was operationalized with a 35-deficit frailty index (FI). Analyzed nodes were the deficits plus death. The edges, linking those nodes were obtained through structural learning, and an undirected graph associated with a discrete probabilistic graphical model (Markov network) was derived. Two algorithms, hill-climbing (hc) and Peter and Clark (PC), were used to derive the graph structure. Analyses were performed for the whole population and tertiles of the total FI score. Results: From the total sample of 10,983 adults aged 50 or older, 43.8\% were women, and the mean age was 64.6 years (SD = 9.3). The number of connections increased according to the tertile level of the FI score. As the FI score raised, groups of interconnected deficits increased and how the nodes are connected changed. Conclusions: Frailty phenomenon can be modeled using a Bayesian network. Using the full sample, the most central nodes were self-report of health (most connected node) and difficulty walking a block, and all deficits related to mobility were very interconnected. When frailty levels are considered, the most connected nodes differ, but are related with vitality, mainly at lower frailty levels. We derived that not all deficits are equally related since clusters of very related deficits and non-connected deficits were obtained, which might be considered in the construction of the FI score. Further research should aim to identify the nature of all observed interactions, which might allow the development of specific interventions to mitigate the consequences of frailty in older adults.","10.1016/j.exger.2019.110747","110747","0531-5565","1873-6815","WOS:000498165000013","PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/B-7265-2011 GarcÃ­a-PeÃ±a, Carmen/F-1468-2011 ","PEREZ-ZEPEDA, MARIO Ulises/0000-0003-4374-976X GarcÃ­a-PeÃ±a, Carmen/0000-0002-9380-6964 Parra-Rodriguez, Lorena/0000-0002-1107-1571 Gomez Verjan, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-7186-8067",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,226

Chinese OHCs are no exception. However, user-generated content (UGC) and the associated user behaviors in Chinese OHCs are largely underexplored and rarely analyzed systematically, forfeiting valuable opportunities for optimizing treatment design and care delivery with insights gained from OHCs. Objective: This study aimed to reveal both the shared and distinct characteristics of 2 popular OHCs in China by systematically and comprehensively analyzing their UGC and the associated user behaviors. Methods: We concentrated on studying the lung cancer forum (LCF) and breast cancer forum (BCF) on Mijian, and the diabetes consultation forum (DCF) on Sweet Home, because of the importance of the 3 diseases among Chinese patients and their prevalence on Chinese OHCs in general. Our analysis explored the key user activities, small-world effect, and scale-free characteristics of each social network. We examined the UGC of these forums comprehensively and adopted the weighted knowledge network technique to discover salient topics and latent relations among these topics on each forum. Finally, we discussed the public health implications of our analysis findings. Results: Our analysis showed that the number of reads per thread on each forum followed gamma distribution (H-L=0, H-B=0, and H-D=0); the number of replies on each forum followed exponential distribution (adjusted R-L(2) =0.946, adjusted R-B(2)=0.958, and adjusted R-D(2) =0.971); and the number of threads a user is involved with (adjusted R-L(2)=0.978, adjusted R-B(2)=0.964, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.970), the number of followers of a user (adjusted R-L(2)=0.989, adjusted R-B(2)=0.962, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.990), and a user's degrees (adjusted R-L(2)=0.997, adjusted R-B(2)=0.994, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.968) all followed power-law distribution. The study further revealed that users are generally more active during weekdays, as commonly witnessed in all 3 forums. In particular, the LCF and DCF exhibited high temporal similarity (rho=0.927; P<.001) in terms of the relative thread posting frequencies during each hour of the day. Besides, the study showed that all 3 forums exhibited the small-world effect (mean sigma(L)=517.15, mean sigma(B)=275.23, and mean sigma(D)=525.18) and scale-free characteristics, while the global clustering coefficients were lower than those of counterpart international OHCs. The study also discovered several hot topics commonly shared among the 3 disease forums, such as disease treatment, disease examination, and diagnosis. In particular, the study found that after the outbreak of COVID-19, users on the LCF and BCF were much more likely to bring up COVID-19-related issues while discussing their medical issues. Conclusions: UGC and related online user behaviors in Chinese OHCs can be leveraged as important sources of information to gain insights regarding individual and population health conditions. Effective and timely mining and utilization of such content can continuously provide valuable firsthand clues for enhancing the situational awareness of health providers and policymakers.","10.2196/19183","e19183","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000740354600002",NA,"ZHOU, Linyun/0000-0001-6500-537X Lei, Yuqi/0000-0001-6984-9609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,229

Thematic and social network analysis guided by the socio-technical systems framework were subsequently employed.ResultsBarriers and facilitators for detecting emerging drug trends in provinces and territories are a product of the collective linkages and interactions between social (objectives, people, culture), technical (tools, practices, infrastructure), and external environmental (financial, regulatory frameworks, stakeholders) factors. Shortcomings in several of these areas shaped the system's behaviour and together contributed to fragmented operations that lacked strategic focus, poorly designed cross-sector partnerships, and unactionable information outputs. Participants' experiences shaped perceptions of a national substance use EWS, with some voicing potential opportunities and others expressing doubts about its effectiveness.ConclusionThis study highlights interconnected social, technical, and external environmental considerations for the design and implementation of a national substance use EWS in Canada. It also demonstrates the value of using the socio-technical systems framework to understand a complex public health surveillance issue and how it can be used to inform a path forward.

NodeXL Pro software was used to collect tweets using the terms 'food' and 'poverty' in any order somewhere in a tweet sent on selected days between April 5 and May 23, 2020. The data obtained from NodeXL Pro were cleaned. Social network analysis tools were used to analyse and visualise our data. Using this method, sentiment-related words (positive or negative words), the top (the most mentioned) 10 hashtags, top words and top word pairs were identified. The patterns of word pairs communicated in our network were visualised based on each word pair's frequency. This also enabled us to carry out a content analysis to create coding of the word pairs' data. A total of 81 249 tweets were identified that contained the terms 'food' and 'poverty'. Our findings revealed that individuals' tweets overwhelmingly contained views about the increase in hunger, food poverty and food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter users perceived that when the pandemic measures began, many food-secure families were pushed into food insecurity due to a rapid rise in unemployment and rising poverty due to the quarantine and stay-at-home instructions in place at the time. They also addressed the sharp rise in food poverty being driven by panic buying, food shortages, food affordability and disruptions in food supply and food systems. Our analysis of this data suggests that to mitigate food poverty or to prevent a 'hunger pandemic' for future pandemic emergencies, comprehensive and longer term policy responses and economic supports are needed to strengthen the resilience of food systems. However, the highlighted limitations of this study must be considered.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","COVID-19; Twitter data; coronavirus; food poverty; pandemic; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,237

We used social network analysis to evaluate whether contacts have the same S. aureus genotype indicating direct transmission or whether contagiousness is an indirect effect of contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. METHODS: The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among 1038 high school students. S. aureus carriage was determined from two nasal swab cultures and the genotype was determined by spa-typing of positive throat swabs. RESULTS: S. aureus carriage and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (P < 0.001). The probability of carriage increased by 5\% for each S. aureus positive contact. Male sex was associated with a 15\% lower risk of transmission compared to the female sex, although the carriage prevalence was higher for men (36\% vs 24\%). Students with medium physical activity levels, medium/high alcohol use, or normal weight had a higher number of contacts and an increased risk of transmission (P < 0.002). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the direct social transmission of S. aureus. Lifestyle factors are associated with the risk of transmission, suggesting the effects of indirect social groups on S. aureus carriage, such as friends having more similar environmental exposures. The male predominance in the carriage is determined by sex-specific predisposing host characteristics as the social transmission is less frequent in males than females.

RECENT FINDINGS: Most articles published in 2019 used regression analyses, and fewer used higher level modeling techniques, frequencies and descriptive, longitudinal cohort study, and social network analysis. Some employed ethnography, qualitative interviews, or were simply reviews. Most syndemic co-factors were substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, depression, intimate partner violence, stigma, sexually transmitted infections, and trauma and non-communicable diseases. Half of the studies were conducted in the United States and mostly in urban areas. Other contexts were Canada, Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Botswana, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, China, Peru, and Romania. SUMMARY: Most recommendations suggested that people living with HIV need interventions that address other factors situated within their life, such as their mental health, social stigma, experiences of trauma and intimate partner violence, and social stigma and sexual risk taking. Many took an intersectoral approach and emphasized the need to consider the various factors that shape experiences with HIV, from sex, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity, and past trauma.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,241

Given the salience of peer relationships during adolescence, and research suggesting that mental health disorders negatively impact social functioning, this study uses novel methodology from social network analysis to uncover the social processes linking disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders with adolescent friendships. In particular, the study focuses on peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer homophily in relation to both disorders. METHODS: Data come from 15-year old students in four Scottish secondary schools (N = 602). Diagnoses of disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders were produced using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, and peer relationship data were obtained through a friendship nomination survey. Exponential random graph models were used to estimate the probability of peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer homophily based on each disorder. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders were more popular than their peers without disruptive behavior disorders (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). Friendship was also more likely between two adolescents both with or both without disruptive behavior disorders (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), demonstrating peer homophily. There was no evidence that anxiety disorders were related to adolescent peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that disruptive behavior disorders may be socially rewarded (e.g., peer popularity) and socially clustered (e.g., homophily), whereas anxiety disorders show no such trends. Thus, intervention efforts must account for the peer social status that may be gained from engaging in disruptive behavior during this developmental period. Further, given that similarity in DBD status is associated with an increased likelihood of friendship, adolescents are likely to be surrounded by peers who reinforce their behaviors.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Adolescents; Anxiety disorders; Disruptive behaviour disorders; Mental health; Peers; Social networks","en",NA,NA,NA,247

OBJECTIVE: To understand \#BTSM's role as a patient support system, we describe user descriptors, growth, interaction, and content sharing. METHODS: We analyzed all tweets containing \#BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. We created a network plot with all publicly available retweets involving \#BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their connections to other users. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, 59,764 unique users participated in \#BTSM, amassing 298,904 tweets. The yearly volume of \#BTSM tweets increased by 264.57\% from 16,394 in 2012 to 43,373 in 2018 with \#BTSM constantly trending in the top 15 list of disease hashtags, as well the top 15 list of tweet chats. Patient advocates generated the most \#BTSM tweets (33.13\%), while advocacy groups, caregivers, doctors, and researchers generated 7.01\%, 4.63\%, 3.86\%, and 3.37\%, respectively.

In many cities, transitions toward green stormwater infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network-specifically, betweenness centrality and openness-defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,252

To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from international health organizations or scientific authorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged time.

Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION: In young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,255

In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. METHODS: Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61\% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. CONCLUSION: Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,259

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during this to-date largest hospital outbreak in Vietnam using social network analysis (SNA). METHODS: We constructed a directed relational network and calculated network metrics for 'degree', 'betweenness', 'closeness' and 'eigenvector' centrality to understand individual-level transmission patterns. We analysed network components and modularity to identify sub-network structures with disproportionately big effects. RESULTS: We detected 68 connections between 46 confirmed cases, of whom 27 (58.7\%) were ancillary support staff, 7 (15.2\%) caregivers, 6 (13\%) patients and 2 (4.4\%) nurses.

Therefore, this study aims to reveal the characteristics and the driving factors of the social rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Based on a sample of 1,537 rumors collected from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided the sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation analysis were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics and the spatial and temporal correlation characteristics of the rumors, and the four stages of development were also divided according to the number of rumors. Besides, to extract the key driving factors from 15 rumor-driving factors, the social network analysis method was used to investigate the driver-driver 1-mode network characteristics, the generation driver-rumor 2-mode network characteristics, and the spreading driver-rumor 2-mode characteristics. RESULTS: Research findings showed that the number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually decreased as the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the four types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating Panic-type rumors were the most harmful to society. The results of rumor drivers indicated that panic psychology and the lag in releasing government information played an essential role in driving the generation and spread of rumors. The public's low scientific literacy and difficulty in discerning highly confusing rumors encouraged them to participate in spreading rumors. CONCLUSION: The study revealed the mechanism of rumors.

This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of non-work-related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19.

In some of these industries, excellent data exist on animal movements, along with the networks that these movements create, and allow researchers to model spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing System is an online recording system for cattle births, deaths and between-herd movements in the United Kingdom and is an excellent resource for any researchers interested in networks or modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system. Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know how much change is occurring in a network, to help judge the merit of using historical data within a modelling context. This article uses the data to construct weighted directed monthly movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and 2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of the network has changed. Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy-makers directly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn could impact policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13 network metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as total number of nodes with movements and total movements, through to metrics to describe the network (e.g., Giant weakly and strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per node (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that there is a statistically significant effect of the period (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the values of nine of the 13 network metrics. For example median total degree decreased by 19\%. In addition to examining networks for two time periods, two updates of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement data stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates. Examination of these updates shows that there are small decreases in problem movements (such as animals leaving slaughterhouses) and therefore evidence of historical data being improved between updates. In combination with the significant effect of period on many of the network metrics, the modification of data between updates provides further evidence that the most recent available data should be used for network modelling.

Here, we use a suite of spatial statistics and social network analysis to characterize animal movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our model utilized equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks, between-farm horse movements, and spatial landscape data from 2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and the movement of horses between farms with climate variables that foster conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a spatially explicit model that allows the effect of the climate variables on EIAV occurrence to vary through space (i.e., non-stationary). Our results identified important areas in which in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as having high 56 (11.3\%), medium 48 (9.66\%), and low 393 (79.1\%) spatial risk. The majority of the movements were between low-risk areas, altogether representing 68.68\% of all animal movements. Meanwhile, 9.48\% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20\% were within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37\% of the animals entering low-risk areas came from high-risk areas. On the other hand, 4.91\% of the animals in the high-risk areas came from low- and medium-risk areas. Our results demonstrate that animal movements and spatial risk mapping could be used to make informed decisions before issuing animal movement permits, thus potentially reducing the chances of reintroducing infection into areas of low risk.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Germany","disease spread; movement flows; non-stationary Gaussian models; risk areas mapping; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,271

We examined the ability to collaborate during the pandemic as part of a baseline evaluation of an intersectoral network of healthcare and community organizations established to improve the collective response to transgender (trans) persons who have been sexually assaulted (the trans-LINK Network). A validated social network analysis survey was sent to 119 member organizations in Ontario, Canada. Survey respondents were asked, 'Has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate with other organizations on the support of trans survivors of sexual assault?' and 'How has COVID-19 negatively affected your organization's ability to collaborate within the trans-LINK Network?'. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Seventy-eight member organizations participated in the survey (response rate = 66\%). Most organizations (79\%) indicated that the pandemic had affected their ability to collaborate with others in the network, citing most commonly, increased workload (77\%), increased demand for services (57\%), and technical and digital challenges (50\%). Survey findings were shared in a stakeholder consultation with 22 representatives of 21 network member organizations. Stakeholders provided suggestions to prevent and address the challenges, barriers, and disruptions in serving trans survivors experienced during the pandemic, which were organized into themes. Seven themes were generated and used as a scaffold for the development of recommendations to advance the network, including: increase communication and knowledge exchange among member organizations through the establishment of a network discussion forum and capacity building group workshops; enhance awareness of network organizations by developing a member-facing directory of member services, their contributions, and ability to provide specific supports; strengthen capacity to provide virtual and in-person services and programs through enhanced IT support and increased opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill development; and adopt a network wide syndemic approach that addresses co-occurring epidemics (COVID-19 + racism, housing insecurity, transphobia, xenophobia) that impact trans survivors of sexual assault.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,272

METHODS: We assessed the association between social network characteristics and prevalent tuberculosis infection among residents (aged $\geq$15 years) of 9 rural communities in Eastern Uganda. Social contacts named during a census were used to create community-specific nonhousehold social networks. We evaluated whether social network structure and characteristics of first-degree contacts (sex, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, tuberculosis infection) were associated with revalent tuberculosis infection (positive tuberculin skin test [TST] result) after adjusting for individual-level risk factors (age, sex, HIV status, tuberculosis contact, wealth, occupation, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'e}rin [BCG] vaccination) with targeted maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS: Among 3 335 residents sampled for TST, 32\% had a positive TST results and 4\% reported a tuberculosis contact. The social network contained 15 328 first-degree contacts. Persons with the most network centrality (top 10\%) (adjusted risk ratio, 1.3 [95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.1]) and the most (top 10\%) male contacts (1.5 [1.3-1.9]) had a higher risk of prevalent tuberculosis, than those in the remaining 90\%. People with $\geq$1 contact with HIV (adjusted risk ratio, 1.3 [95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.6]) and $\geq$2 contacts with tuberculosis infection were more likely to have tuberculosis themselves (2.6 [ 95\% confidence interval: 2.2-2.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Social networks with higher centrality, more men, contacts with HIV, and tuberculosis infection were positively associated with tuberculosis infection.

These conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign \#yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8(th) to 23(rd), 2020. Tweets included content \#yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS: A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82\% were tweets.

Understanding the care and support networks of a frail individual could therefore prove useful in understanding need and designing support. This study explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of likely frailty, by describing and comparing the individuals' networks as perceived by themselves and as perceived by healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare professionals were recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls Group' programme within North-West London. Individual (i.e., one on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted to establish an individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural characteristics of the networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic analysis aided data interpretation. RESULTS: All reported care and support networks showed a high contribution level from family and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the 'frequency' and 'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare professional reported networks, the reported frequency of interaction as detailed in patient records was used to ascertain 'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the importance of the role of informal carers and friends along with healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with frailty. There was congruence in the makeup of 'patient' and 'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight the multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which could be targeted by healthcare professionals to support the care of frail individuals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Care and Support Networks; Community-Dwelling; Frailty; Older People; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,276

A growing body of work suggests that coalition network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017). Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their nominated discussion partners (``first-degree alters'') related to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties' interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included 558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations, parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected (1\%-3\% of possible ties observed) and most and least centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time, ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources, ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have supported more equal participation and control over intervention efforts.

This study aimed to describe the network between premises such as production herds, slaughterhouses, and traders of pig movements and identify heterogeneities in the connectivity of premises in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, using social network analysis (SNA). We used static and temporal network approaches to describe pig trade in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of node-loyalty, resilience of outgoing contact chains, and communities. Two indexes were implemented, the first one is a normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures and other index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized by a municipality to target and rank surveillance activities. Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in that 80 \% of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were found. The results also showed that premises were highly connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 \% of the paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the use of time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate potential transmission pathways and outbreak sizes.

Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships. However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic. This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities. The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective. The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le{\'o}n, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020. The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.

The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures. The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players. Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection. The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection. The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network. Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.

To propose the precise strategy for supervision of pig movements in Hunan Province, a weighted directed one-mode network was constructed using the data from the electronic animal health certificate platform in 2017. The nodes were designed as districts in Hunan and edges as flows of pig movement between districts. Social network analysis was used to analyse network characteristics and generalized linear models were performed to ascertain the socioeconomic factors that affect the pig movement network. During 2017, the pig movement network within the Hunan Province was composed of 122 nodes and 8562 directed connections, with a total of 510,973 shipments and 17,815,040 pigs moved. The network displayed a small-world topology, which had a higher clustering coefficient (0.4 vs. 0.1) and shorter average shortest path length (1.8 vs. 3.7) compared with equivalent random networks. The degree centrality positively correlated with closeness centrality (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) as well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). After restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the top 10 \% of degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by nearly 50 \% in the network, whereas the number of pigs was reduced by 94.0 \% when movement restrictions were implemented in areas with the top 50 \% of degree centrality. Observed network metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking in November and December. Generalized linear models showed that the size of the human population and per capita gross domestic product were the most important socioeconomic drivers of pig movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a small-world network in which the introduction and spread of diseases may be quicker. More human, material, and financial resources should be allocated to areas with higher centrality.

When such disasters occur, the central government of South Korea and its affiliated local governments-together with nongovernmental organizations-play a crucial role in crisis management systems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to corroborate the characteristics government ministries and domestic and foreign institutions exhibit through their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the social network analysis technique, the span of the COVID-19 pandemic was segmented into 3 time frames, and the relational characteristics of the COVID-19 contagious disease response department and related agencies at home and abroad were analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the second and third time frames indicates that the agents reacting to contagious diseases do not necessarily hold the central position in the network. From this, it can be inferred that it is not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the key to a successful response to various disasters also lies in cooperation with the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruency between the findings of this paper and the existing disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that both the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate for a coordinated crisis response in disaster situations.

METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to develop precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster outbreaks.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Korea (South)","COVID-19; Physical distancing; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,303

The introduction of legislation regulating tobacco use in public spaces varies across countries, impacting the tobacco control context. Thus reviewing our knowledge of how social networks may influence smoking differently within different contexts is required to facilitate the development of context-specific interventions. METHODS: The search, conducted on 31st May 2019, included the following smoking-related terms; schools, adolescents, peers and social networks. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied throughout the title and abstract screening and full text screening. Quality assessment and synthesis followed. Studies were narratively synthesised to identify changes according to legislative context. This synthesis was conducted separately for findings relating to three categories: socioeconomic status; social selection and influence; and network position. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. Differences in the relationship between network characteristics and smoking according to socioeconomic status were measured in five out of fifteen studies in Europe. Results varied across studies, with differences in network characteristics and their association with smoking varying both between schools of a differing and those of a similar socioeconomic composition. For studies conducted both before and after the introduction of comprehensive smoking legislation, the evidence for selection processes was more consistent than influence, which varied according to reciprocity. Findings showed that isolates were more likely to smoke and in-degree and out-degree centrality were related to smoking both before and after the introduction of legislation. The relationship between popularity and smoking was contingent on school level smoking prevalence in studies conducted before the introduction of legislation, but not after. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, effects according to socioeconomic status were underreported in the included studies and no consistent evidence of change after the introduction of a comprehensive smoking ban was observed. Further network analyses are required using more recent data to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how network processes may influence smoking differently according to socioeconomic status, and how adaptation could be used to enhance intervention effectiveness.

Less is known about the relationship between care fragmentation and total spending, and whether this relationship is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on the number of shared patients among providers (ie, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured using average path length, which describes how efficiently information flows among network members; longer path length indicates greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of care fragmentation and multivariable regression were used to analyze the relationship between care fragmentation and LVAD payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81\% male, 73\% white, 11\% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of 63.1 years (11.1). The mean (SD) level of care fragmentation in provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) payment from admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872).

Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content. METHODS: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's $\kappa$ ranged 0.71-1.0 after double-coding. RESULTS: The majority (89\%) of individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as ``trust,'' ``alternatives,'' ``safety,'' and ``conspiracy.'' For example, a comment representative of ``conspiracy'' is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the ``alternatives'' sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water fluoridation and circumcision. CONCLUSIONS: Social media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals.

Here, we analyze multimodal COVID-19-associated data collected during the 2020-2021 academic year at Colorado Mesa University and introduce a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and response framework. METHODS: We analyzed epidemiological and sociobehavioral data (demographics, contact tracing, and WiFi-based co-location data) alongside pathogen surveillance data (wastewater and diagnostic testing, and viral genomic sequencing of wastewater and clinical specimens) to characterize outbreak dynamics and inform policy. We applied relative risk, multiple linear regression, and social network assortativity to identify attributes or behaviors associated with contracting SARS-CoV-2. To characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we used viral sequencing, phylogenomic tools, and functional assays. FINDINGS: Athletes, particularly those on high-contact teams, had the highest risk of testing positive. On average, individuals who tested positive had more contacts and longer interaction durations than individuals who never tested positive. The distribution of contacts per individual was overdispersed, although not as overdispersed as the distribution of phylogenomic descendants. Corroboration via technical replicates was essential for identification of wastewater mutations.

Therefore, optimal vaccination dissemination would appreciably lower the death and infection rates. This paper proposes the Epidemic Vulnerability Index (EVI) that quantitatively evaluates the subject's potential risk. Our primary aim for the suggested index is to diminish both infection rate and death rate efficiently. EVI was accordingly designed with clinical factors determining the mortality and social factors incorporating the infection rate. Through statistical COVID-19 patient dataset analysis and social network analysis with an agent-based model that is analogous to a real-world system, we define and experimentally validate the capability of EVI. Our experiments consist of nine vaccination distribution scenarios, including existing indexes which estimate the risk and stochastically proliferate the contagion and vaccine in a 300,000 agent-based graph network. We compared the outcome and variation of the three metrics in the experiments: infection case, death case, and death rate. Through this assessment, vaccination by the descending order of EVI has shown to have a significant outcome with an average of 5.0\% lower infection cases, 9.4\% lower death cases, and 3.5\% lower death rate than other vaccine distribution routes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,310

We sought to understand the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on ethnocultural communities to inform intersectoral advocacy and community action. METHODS: The Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with social network analysis. RESULTS: Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal health and social system supports. INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation.

This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. METHODS: Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. RESULTS: In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6\%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend.

However, little is known about the impact of collective-level social isolation on health outcomes. We sought to examine the association of group-level segregation with cardiovascular health (CVH) in older adults. METHODS: From the prospective Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project database, we identified 528 community-dwelling older adults who were aged $\geq$60 years or were married to those aged $\geq$60 years. Participants who belonged to smaller social groups separate from the major social group were defined as group-level-segregated. The CVH score was calculated as the number of ideal non-dietary CVH metrics (0-6), as modified from the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between group-level segregation and CVH. RESULTS: Of the 528 participants (mean age, 71.7 years; 60.0\% female), 108 (20.5\%) were segregated at baseline. In the crosssectional analysis, group-level segregation was significantly associated with lower odds of having a higher CVH score at baseline after adjusting for socio-demographic factors and cognitive function (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.95).

Research on economic patterns and urban network systems can provide a reference for healthy development of the regional economic system. The evolution of the economic pattern and urban network system of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2010 to 2020 is investigated using methods (e.g., the gravity center model, the gravitational force model, social network analysis, and geographic information system). (1) The gravity center of gross domestic product (GDP) of the GBA is located in Nansha district, Guangzhou, with a skewing direction northwest-east-northwest and a movement rate of ``large-small-large.'' The center of import and export and the center of consumption show a ``zigzagging migration'' in which the center of investment shows an ``irregular (random) migration''. (2) The economic connection degree of cities in the GBA exhibits a high ascending velocity, and the whole area tends to be mature, with a significant effect of spatial proximity. With the steady increase in network density, there is significant polarization of network centrality in the region. The four major cohesive subgroups have been relatively stable and consistent with the degree of geographic proximity of the cities. The center-periphery structure is more significant, in which the core area is extended to the cities on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary, thus forming the core cluster of ``Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Dongguan.'' In this study, the evolution of economic patterns and urban network systems in the GBA over the past decade is analyzed using multiple methods (i.e., gravity model, urban network system analysis, and geographic information system) based on urban socioeconomic data by starting from various spatial elements (e.g., ``points, lines, and networks'') to gain insights into and optimize research on regional economic development after the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area (GBA); economic pattern; gravity center model; social network; urban network","en",NA,NA,NA,332

We conducted a 2-mode social network analysis of people by the types of places they visited, focusing on the forms of centrality exhibited by place types. RESULTS: The most exposed locations were grocery stores, commercial stores, restaurants, commercial services, and schools. These types of locations also have the highest ``betweenness,'' meaning that they tend to serve as hubs between other kinds of locations since people would usually visit more than 1 location in a day or when infected. The highest pairs of locations were grocery store/retail store, restaurant/retail store, and restaurant/grocery store. Schools are not at the top but are 3 times in the top 7 pairs of locations and connected to the 3 types of locations in those top pairs.

We conducted a review of case notes and a social network analysis to understand how workplace and social networks enabled the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among RACS. DESIGN: Retrospective outbreak review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Staff involved in COVID-19 outbreaks in RACS in Victoria, Australia, May-October 2020. METHODS: The Victorian Department of Health COVID-19 case and contact data were reviewed to construct 2 social networks: (1) a work network connecting RACS through workers and (2) a household network connecting to RACS through households. Probable index cases were reviewed to estimate the number and size (number of resident cases and deaths) of outbreaks likely initiated by multisite work versus transmission via households. RESULTS: Among 2,033 cases linked to an outbreak as staff, 91 (4.5\%) were multisite staff cases. Forty-three outbreaks were attributed to multisite work and 35 were deemed potentially preventable had staff worked at a single site. In addition, 99 staff cases were linked to another RACS outbreak through their household contacts, and 21 outbreaks were attributed to staff-household transmission.

Some studies argue that high-density urban centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19. While several studies have examined the role of urban density and connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing different measures of urban density and connectivity during the first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database. We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county level, collected individually from regional government websites in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure, particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better indicator of COVID-19 proliferation than the density measures. Our findings imply that policies that take into account different types of connectivity between cities might be necessary to contain the outbreak in the early phase.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","COVID-19; connectivity; density; negative binomial regression; social network analysis; spatial proliferation","en",NA,NA,NA,340

These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,343

Therefore, public authorities in many countries mandate livestock holdings to report all movements of animals. However, the reported data often does not contain information about the exact sequence of transports, making it impossible to assess the effect of truck sharing and truck contamination on disease transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig transport network by means of social network analysis and to assess the implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In particular, we studied how additional information about transport sequences changes the topology of the contact network. The study is based on the official animal movement database in Switzerland and a sample of transport data from one transport company. The results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease outbreak. By considering the time sequence of transports, we found that even in the worst case, only 0.34\% of all farm-pairs were connected within one month. However, both network connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if truck sharing and especially truck contamination were considered. Therefore, the extent to which a disease may be transmitted between animal holdings may be underestimated if we only consider data from the official animal movement database. Our results highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck sharing and contamination. As the nature of animal transport networks is inherently temporal, we strongly suggest the use of temporal network measures in order to evaluate individual and overall risk of disease transmission through animal transportation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,346

This approach, along with user behavior indicators, can optimize the pharmacovigilance process by flagging the need for immediate attention and further investigation. We specifically focus on the Levothyrox\textregistered{} case in France, which sparked media attention due to changes in the medication formula and affected patient behavior on medical forums. For classification, we propose a deep learning architecture called Word Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN), trained on word clouds from patient comments.

Recently, a growing number of layer farms have been heavily damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased virulence of the virus and the intensification of the production system. Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive practices at the farm level that are aligned with contingency measures at the national level to minimize poultry losses. However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm workers to follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and control. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices varies with the geographical condition and inter-farm contact structures. Hence, the objective of our study was to examine the preventive effect of five biosecurity actions commonly practiced at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: (i) fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a farm; iii) disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection protocols, iv) an anterior room in the sheds before entering the bird area and v) boots changes when moving between sheds in the same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer case farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI epidemic. The odds ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices implemented in those study groups were estimated as a preventive effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, including seven geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location weighted logistic regression. The results showed that the use of a disinfection booth for personnel reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 \% credible interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263).

Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols at the farm of entry for layer farms is recommended to effectively prevent and respond to HPAIv H5N6 infection under different local condition.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States","Inuit; molecular epidemiology; tuberculosis; whole-genome sequencing","en",NA,NA,NA,362

Little is known, however, about whether policies affect how behaviours are shared in a network. To contribute to this literature, we apply the concept of diffusion centrality to school tobacco policies and adolescent smoking. Diffusion centrality is a measure of centrality which refers to a person's ability to diffuse a given property-in our case, smoking-related behaviours. We hypothesized that stronger school tobacco policies are associated with less diffusion centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in general. A whole network study was carried out in 2013 and 2016 among adolescents (n = 18,805) in 38 schools located in six European cities. Overall, diffusion centrality of smoking in general and of smoking on school premises significantly decreased over time. Diffusion centrality of smoking significantly decreased both in schools where the policy strengthened or softened over time, but for diffusion of smoking on school premises, this decrease was only significant in schools where it strengthened. Finally, stronger school tobacco policies were associated with lower diffusion centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in general, though to a lesser extent. With such policies, smoking may, therefore, become less prevalent, less popular, and less clustered, thereby lowering the risk of it spreading within networks in, and even outside the school.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States","Adolescent behaviour; Diffusion centrality; Key players; Smoke-free policy; Social network analysis; Whole network design","en",NA,NA,NA,363

Social relations and multigenerational networks (i.e., peer, family, kinship, and community) remain a salient fixture of AI culture, survival and thriving in reservation communities. Research in other populations has demonstrated how social networks impact youth risk and resilience, but data are lacking on AI adolescent networks. Intergenerational trauma from settler colonialism leads some AI youth to early initiation of substance use and subsequent substance misuse, along with disproportionately high risk for suicide and vulnerability to witnessing and experiencing violence. Using network data to develop prevention strategies among this population is a promising new avenue of research. In this study protocol paper, we describe the rationale and methodology of an exploratory study to be conducted with American Indian 9th and 10th graders at three schools on a Northern Plains reservation. METHODS: This mixed methods study will collect quantitative social network surveys (N = 300) and qualitative interviews (n = 30). The study will examine the extent to which existing social network theories and data metrics adequately characterize AI youth networks or how they may need to be expanded for this population. Associations of network characteristics with risk and protective factors for substance use, exposure to violence, and suicide will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This innovative methodological approach holds promise for informing the development of effective preventive approaches to address co-occurring risks for substance use, violence and suicide among AI adolescents. Understanding processes that impact social networks among AI adolescents can promote culturally resonant social relationships that may support better outcomes for youth.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Indigenous; Native; Social network analysis; Substance use; Suicide; Violence","en",NA,NA,NA,365

Active case finding was conducted among workers in both factories using face-to-face interviews. Suspected cases were defined as a worker who developed fever with rash with one of the following symptoms: cough, coryza or conjunctivitis. Testing for measles IgM antibodies and viral identification through throat swabs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to confirm diagnosis. Vaccination history among cases was reviewed. Nationality and age-specific attack rates (AR) were calculated. An environmental study and a social network analysis were conducted to better understand the transmission process. A total 56 cases (AR = 0.97\%) were identified. Of 21 serum measles IgM collected, 8 (38.0\%) were positive. Of 8 throat swabs collected, 5 (62.5\%) were positive for measles genotype D8. The disease attack rate in migrant employees was twice as large as the rate in Thai counterparts (AR = 0.7 and 1.4\%). The first case was identified as a Myanmar worker who arrived in Thailand two weeks prior to his illness. The Myanmar workers' accommodation was more crowded than that for Thai workers. The hot spots of transmission were found at a drinking water tank which had shared glasses. Among the cases, 62.5\% could not recall their vaccination history, and 25\% had never had an injection containing a measles vaccination. The majority of migrant cases had never completed a two-dose measles vaccination. To halt the outbreak, measles vaccines were administered to the employees, particularly those working in the same sections with the cases and shared glasses were removed. For future policy action, a vaccination program should be incorporated into the work permit issuance process.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","Thailand; measles; migrant; outbreak","en",NA,NA,NA,366

METHODS: We analyzed the electronic medical records (EMRs) of lung cancer patients over age 65 in the Jilin Province of China. The data studied were obtained from 20 hospitals of Jilin Province in 2018. In total, 1510 patients were identified. We conducted a rank-frequency analysis and social network analysis to identify the predominant comorbidities and comorbidity networks. We applied the association rules to mine the comorbidity combination with the values of confidence and lift. A heatmap was utilized to visualize the rules. RESULTS: Our analyses discovered that (1) there were 31 additional medical conditions in older patients with lung cancer. The most frequent comorbidities were pneumonia, cerebral infarction, and hypertension. (2) The network-based analysis revealed seven subnetworks. (3) The association rules analysis provided 41 interesting rules. The results revealed that hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and pneumonia are the most frequent comorbid combinations. Heart failure may not have a strong implicating role in these comorbidity patterns. Cerebral infarction was rarely combined with other diseases. In addition, glycoprotein metabolism disorder comorbid with hyponatremia or hypokalemia increased the risk of anemia by more than eight times in older lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the comorbidity patterns of older men with lung cancer in China. Understanding the comorbidity patterns of older patients with lung cancer can assist clinicians in their diagnoses and contribute to developing healthcare policies, as well as allocating resources.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","aging; association rules; chronic disease management; comorbidity; lung cancer","en",NA,NA,NA,368

Arguments based on social identity theory, however, suggest that only same-ethnic but not cross-ethnic friends are important for ERI development. Using longitudinal social network analysis, we examined peer influence of both same- and cross-ethnic friends on ERI attachment and private regard. Data were drawn from six ethnically diverse schools in Western Germany (N = 1,349; M(age) = 13.3). Our results provide empirical evidence for early adolescents' ERI being influenced by same- but less by cross-ethnic friends. Considering peers' ethnicity therefore is crucial for understanding peer influence on ERI development.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,370

We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia.
