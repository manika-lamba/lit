We examined different network properties that might affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public health officials and health agencies. Methods: We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as Twitter. Results: We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public health. Conclusions: Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and evaluate risk communication efforts.","10.1017/dmp.2020.347","PII S193578932000347X","1935-7893","1938-744X","WOS:000851039600027",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

Social media use increased worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials and methods Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network analysis would help reduce the ``infodemic{''} before administering the vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively in this regard.","10.1080/21645515.2021.2025008",NA,"2164-5515","2164-554X","WOS:000750770500001","Durmaz, Nihal/AAV-7433-2021 ","Durmaz, Nihal/0000-0002-3079-1769 HENGIRMEN, ENGIN/0000-0001-9330-3251","JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

Publishing social network data not only bring benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also give birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding.

In Nigeria, stillbirths are a common public health problem. However, limited attention has been given to the social ramifications of stillbirths. This study describes the social networks of women who have experienced a stillbirth and the factors influencing their social networks. Interviews and social network diagrams were used to collect data from 20 women about their social networks before and after stillbirth. Findings suggest that the experience of shame, unmet expectation of support, and a lack of trust led to relationship changes after stillbirth. Most participants met bereavement needs with their existing social networks before stillbirth, but many participants also experienced relationship losses (even among family networks).

Such method has been applied to many aspects of illicit drug research, including in the areas of public health, epidemiology, and criminology. Previous reviews about social networks and drugs have lacked a focus on the use of sociometric network analysis for illicit drugs research across disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the sociometric network analysis methods used in illicit drugs research and to assess how such methods could be used for future research. MethodsA systematic search of six databases (Web of Science, ProQuest Sociology Collection, Political Science Complete, PubMed, Criminal Justice Abstracts, and PsycINFO) returned 72 relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to mention illicit drugs and use whole social network analysis as one of their methods. Studies were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively using a data-charting form and a description of the studies' main topics. ResultsSociometric network analysis in illicit drugs research has grown in popularity in the last decade, using mostly descriptive network metrics, such as degree centrality (72.2\%) and density (44.4\%). Studies were found to belong to three study domains. The first, drug crimes investigated network resilience and collaboration patterns in drug trafficking networks. The second domain, public health, focused on the social networks and social support of people who use drugs. Finally, the third domain focused on the collaboration networks of policy, law enforcement, and service providers. ConclusionFuture illicit drugs research using whole network SNA should include more diverse data sources and samples, incorporate mixed and qualitative methods, and apply social network analysis to study drug policy.","10.1371/journal.pone.0282340","e0282340","1932-6203",NA,"WOS:000996122900034","Ritter, Alison/K-1195-2012 ","/0000-0003-3582-3261",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11

Objective: Health conspiracy theories are gaining in popularity. This study's objective was to evaluate the Twitter social media network related to the magnetic vaccine conspiracy theory and apply social capital theory to analyze the unique social structures of influential users. As a strategy for web-based public health surveillance, we conducted a social network analysis to identify the important opinion leaders sharing the conspiracy, the key websites, and the narratives. Methods: A total of 18,706 tweets were retrieved and analyzed by using social network analysis. Data were retrieved from June 1 to June 13, 2021, using the keyword vaccine magnetic. Tweets were retrieved via a dedicated Twitter application programming interface. More specifically, the Academic Track application programming interface was used, and the data were analyzed by using NodeXL Pro (Social Media Research Foundation) and Gephi. Results: There were a total of 22,762 connections between Twitter users within the data set. This study found that the most influential user within the network consisted of a news account that was reporting on the magnetic vaccine conspiracy. There were also several other users that became influential, such as an epidemiologist, a health economist, and a retired sports athlete who exerted their social capital within the network. Conclusions: Our study found that influential users were effective broadcasters against the conspiracy, and their reach extended beyond their own networks of Twitter followers. We emphasize the need for trust in influential users with regard to health information, particularly in the context of the widespread social uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when public sentiment on social media may be unpredictable. This study highlights the potential of influential users to disrupt information flows of conspiracy theories via their unique social capital.","10.2196/43497","e43497","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:001005979900003","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/L-6071-2017 ","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Hardey, Mariann (Maz)/0000-0002-1027-0165 Fuster-Casanovas, Aina/0000-0001-9128-9580 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12

Method/process We study SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' personal (i.e., self-disclosure) and situational (i.e., social networks) attributes, using a mixed design of content analysis and social network analysis. Result/conclusion We compare users' within-person changes in self-disclosure and social networks in two phases (over half a year), drawing on Weibo Depression SuperTalk, an online community for depression, and find: Several network attributes strengthen social support, including network connectivity, global efficiency, degree centralization, hubs of communities, and reciprocal interactions. Users' self-disclosure attributes reflect positive changes in mental well-being and increased attachment to the community. Correlations exist between users' topological and self-disclosure attributes. A Poisson regression model extracts self-disclosure attributes that may affect users' received social support, including the writing length, number of active days, informal words, adverbs, negative emotion words, biological process words, and first-person singular forms. Innovation We combine social network analysis with content analysis, highlighting the need to understand SNS' effects on well-being by accounting for users' self-disclosure (content) and communication partners (social networks). Implication/contribution Authentic user data helps to avoid recall bias commonly found in self-reported data. A longitudinal within-person analysis of SNS' effects on well-being is helpful for policymakers in public health intervention, community managers for group organizations, and users in online community engagement.","10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1092884","1092884","1664-1078",NA,"WOS:000967089900001",NA,"Khoo, Zhao Wei/0009-0009-8469-7864 shi, jiayi/0000-0003-4215-3374",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16

Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak in an educational setting. Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection. Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M. tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated with case status and risk communities. Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7\% positivity rate) and nine active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was 39.1\% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious case (odds ratio 7.3, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The community structure analysis divided the students into five communities based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social network analysis identified that the community including the suspected index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds ratio 7.5, 95\% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single SNP difference. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological approaches to direct public health action in this setting.","10.1186/s12879-019-3734-8","154","1471-2334",NA,"WOS:000458616900001",NA,"Brooks-Pollock, Ellen/0000-0002-5984-4932 /0000-0002-9157-3650 Beck, Charles Richard/0000-0002-0967-5333",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17

The historical towns in China have evolved into massive rural-urban migration under the rapid urbanization over the past forty years. In this context, many of these historical towns experienced ``declining built environment and disintegrating social networks, `` which does not contribute to the adaptive renewal of the built environment and social networks in historical towns, as well as the psychological health of residents. This article intends to explore the adaptive renewal of the built environment and social networks of historical towns based on the SSNS. Data on ``households `` and ``social ties `` (i.e., kinship, geographic, and job relationship) among households were collected via a field survey in seven historical towns in Chongqing, China. K-core models of social network analysis (SNA) were calculated to analyze SSNS. The result shows that the social networks of historical towns with centripetal-shaped structures were more stable than historical towns with divergent-shaped structures. Moreover, spatial layout forms and functions of households might affect the stability of social networks in historical towns. Based on the results of the analysis of SSNS, strategies for adaptive renewal of the built environments and social networks were put forward in two aspects. The built environment, such as the classification of public spaces and service facilities, can be designed based on the k-core indicator for increasing the spatial connection of households in the historical towns. In addition, increased social activities in historical towns with weak SSNS may promote social connection of households, and are also helpful in boosting public health in psychological aspects.","10.3389/fpubh.2022.867407","867407",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000790887900001","Zhang, Junxue/JZD-4517-2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18

Most of the proposals have focused on dealing with static datasets gathered from social networks, which are processed and mined off-line. However, little work has been done on providing a general framework to analyse the highly dynamic data of social networks from a multidimensional perspective. In this paper, we claim that such a framework is crucial for including social data in PHS systems. Methods: We propose a dynamic multidimensional approach to deal with social data streams. In this approach, dynamic dimensions are continuously updated by applying unsupervised text mining methods. More specifically, we analyse the semantics and temporal patterns in posts for identifying relevant events, topics and users. We also define quality metrics to detect relevant user profiles. In this way, the incoming data can be further filtered to cope with the goals of PHS systems. Results: We have evaluated our approach over a long-term stream of Twitter. We show how the proposed quality metrics allow us to filter out the users that are out-of-domain as well as those with low quality in their messages. We also explain how specific user profiles can be identified through their descriptions. Finally, we illustrate how the proposed multidimensional model can be used to identify main events and topics, as well as to analyse their audience and impact. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed dynamic multidimensional model is able to identify relevant events and topics and analyse them from different perspectives, which is especially useful for PHS systems.","10.3390/ijerph17072289","2289",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000530763300121","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/ABF-5171-2021 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/K-9590-2014","Aramburu, MarÃ­a JosÃ©/0000-0002-8026-8351 Lanza Cruz, Indira Lazara/0000-0003-2413-2799 Berlanga Llavori, Rafael/0000-0002-9155-269X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20

A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are ``empty.{''} Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. Objective: This study set out to evaluate the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future. Methods: Twitter data related to the \#FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots. Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network. Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content.","10.2196/22374","e22374","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000600296800001","Katz, Matthew/AAS-7308-2020 Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Lopez Segui, Francesc/A-6483-2019 ","Katz, Matthew/0000-0002-0239-9807 Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Lopez Segui, Francesc/0000-0003-0977-0215 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21

However, community partners' collaboration experiences remain understated in the literature. Thus, there is a need to further advance methodological approaches that examine the effectiveness of CAPs, while also highlighting community voice to, ultimately, improve public health outcomes. Objectives: (1) To demonstrate how a practical approach to mixed methods social network analysis (MMSNA) can highlight power dynamics in community health partnerships and use MMSNA data to build relationships across stakeholders for systems change efforts Methods: MMSNA was used to examine a CAP focused on public health equity in a Midwest region. The project applied a sequential mixed methods design (QUAN -> QUAL) with a network survey and individual semi-structured interviews. Both data strands served the function of expansion, where quantitative data identified what relationships existed in the network, level of activity, and factors for motivations, providing breadth of collaboration. Qualitative data further elaborated on how partners perceived these experiences, providing depth and contextualizing quantitative results. Conclusions: Systems level approaches must be applied to capture broader contexts (e.g., community, interpersonal, and individual) surrounding community health partnerships. The use of MMSNA maximizes benefits from a systems methodology-social network analysis-with qualitative interviews that allow for the critical assessment of network structure and community centered perspectives. Community health partnerships are encouraged to utilize this approach in order to deliver more sustainable public health efforts centered on the community that is directly impacted.","10.1353/cpr.2022.0029",NA,"1557-0541","1557-055X","WOS:000814210800005","Bustos, Tatiana/AHA-0252-2022","Bustos, Tatiana/0000-0002-0776-7701",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24

Little attention has been paid to the effect of patient transfers on MDRO dissemination among health care entities in health care systems. In this study, the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) developed a baseline social network analysis of patient movement across health care entities in Orange County, Florida, and regionally, within 6 surrounding counties in Central Florida. Materials and Methods DOH-Orange constructed 2 directed network sociograms-graphic visualizations that show the direction of relationships (ie, county and regional)-by using 2016 health insurance data from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services, which include metrics that could be useful for local public health interventions, such as MDRO outbreaks. Results We found that both our county and regional networks were sparse and centralized. The county-level network showed that acute-care hospitals had the highest influence on controlling the flow of patients between health care entities that would otherwise not be connected. The regional-level network showed that post-acute-care hospitals and other facilities (behavioral hospitals and mental health/substance abuse facilities) served as the primary controls for flow of patients between health care entities. The most prominent health care entities in both networks were the same 2 acute-care hospitals. Practice Implications Social network analysis can help local public health officials respond to MDRO outbreak investigations by determining which health care facilities are the main contributors of dissemination of MDROs or are at high risk of receiving patients with MDROs. This information can help epidemiologists prioritize prevention efforts and develop county- or regional-specific interventions to control and halt MDRO transmission across a health care network.","10.1177/0033354920930213","0033354920930213","0033-3549","1468-2877","WOS:000540706300001","Rankin, Danielle A/AAT-8589-2021 ","Rankin, Danielle A/0000-0003-3018-3373 Matthews, Sarah/0000-0001-8372-1185","JUN 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28

Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media marketing, where influencers-for example, bloggers, brand ambassadors-post promotional materials. This study analysed the network of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. Methods We tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of 1\%-25\% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities) influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers' followers aged 13-17 years old and the age verification practices restricting youth access were also assessed. Results There is a highly interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55) worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers compared with the European influencers. 75\% of the influencers did not restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20). Conclusions It is important to understand associations among influencers and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective public health communication and potential policies that could regulate social media marketing sponsored by e-cigarette companies.","10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2021-057053",NA,"0964-4563","1468-3318","WOS:000753985400001","Laestadius, Linnea/AAC-1911-2019 ","Laestadius, Linnea/0000-0003-3272-9317 Stanton, Cassandra/0000-0001-5329-6261 Li, Dongmei/0000-0001-9140-2483 Vassey, Julia/0000-0003-3002-2000 Unger, Jennifer/0000-0001-9064-6603 Cruz, Tess Boley/0000-0002-5894-1802","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online information, particularly information on social media. The first step toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization debate on social media platforms.Objective: We aimed to evaluate societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance.Methods: Social network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets published in English and French were collected through the Twitter application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised machine learning approach to natural language processing using a sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine hesitancy.Results: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2\%) of the conversations on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8\%) expressed criticism toward the government's handling of the pandemic.Conclusions: Social media content analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered, as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.","10.2196/28800","e28800",NA,"2564-1891","WOS:001129248500004","Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015 ","Benham, Jamie L/0000-0002-2233-4613 Fullerton, Madison/0000-0002-8345-2859 Tang, Theresa/0000-0001-8569-5953 Mourali, Mehdi/0000-0002-9969-3892 Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37

The complete procedure for carrying out a social network analysis (SNA) is a time-consuming task that entails a series of steps in which the expert in social network analysis could make mistakes. This research presents a multi-domain knowledge model capable of automatically gathering data and carrying out different social network analyses in different domains, without errors and obtaining the same conclusions that an expert in SNA would obtain. The model is represented in an ontology called OntoSNAQA, which is made up of classes, properties and rules representing the domains of People, Questionnaires and Social Network Analysis. Besides the ontology itself, different rules are represented by SWRL and SPARQL queries. A Knowledge Based System was created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a real case study in order to show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the results of an SNA analysis obtained through the model were compared to those obtained from some of the most widely used SNA applications: UCINET, Pajek, Cytoscape and Gephi, to test and confirm the validity of the model.

Graph embedding methods build an important bridge between social network analysis and data analytics, as social networks naturally generate an unprecedented volume of graph data continuously. Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also gives birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework using ground truth social network datasets.","10.26599/TST.2021.9010015",NA,"1007-0214","1878-7606","WOS:000703899400003","Cai, Zhipeng/AAA-7659-2021 ","Zhang, Kainan/0000-0003-4267-7143 Cai, Zhipeng/0000-0001-6017-975X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39

Many community-based programmes design interventions to address tangible challenges within the social determinants of health, such as asset insecurity or food insecurity, to address health inequities. The growing need to address social isolation within marginalised communities also requires organisations to collaborate and create community partnerships that strengthen their own social integration within the community. The present research reports on the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of community programmes within three southern U.S. cities and their local collaborations to address social isolation. After interviewing representatives of 46 community organisations, it was found that social service organisations that also offer public health services play a central role in community efforts to improve social isolation. The participating organisations primarily collaborate through referrals and information sharing, and report inadequate resources. With a growing recognition that social services and supports play a considerable role in addressing health inequities, this study provides evidence of opportunities for interorganisational collaboration to promote individual and community health.","10.1111/hsc.14044",NA,"0966-0410","1365-2524","WOS:000862272800001",NA,"Creel, Liza/0000-0003-1222-678X","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41

The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is still a challenge.","10.3390/su12114655","4655",NA,"2071-1050","WOS:000543391800318","Fernandez de Arroyabe, Juan Carlos/T-5755-2017 ","Fernandez de Arroyabe, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-1451-3782 Calvo Gallardo, Elena/0000-0002-2002-6190",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,42

Algorithmic recommendation-based technology along with users' selective exposure and group pressure lead to online echo chambers, causing inefficiency in vaccination promotion. Avoiding or breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior. Objective: With the ultimate goal of eliminating the impact of echo chambers related to vaccine hesitancy on social media during public health emergencies, the aim of this study was to develop a framework to quantify the echo chamber effect in users' topic selection and attitude contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations; detect online opinion leaders and structural hole spanners based on network attributes; and explore the relationships of their behavior patterns and network locations, as well as the relationships of network locations and impact on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Methods: We called the Sina Weibo application programming interface to crawl tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user information on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. Adopting social network analysis, we examined the low echo chamber effect based on topics in representational networks of information, according to attitude in communication flow networks of users under different interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual analyses were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and to explore their function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Results: Users showed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, whereas the opposite trend was found for the latter. Speakers, replicators, and monologists tended to be opinion leaders, whereas common users, retweeters, and networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and spanners tended to be ``bridgers{''} to disseminate diverse topics and communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, users who tended to echo a single topic could bridge multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also tended to serve as bridgers for different attitudes. Conclusions: This study not only revealed a low echo chamber effect in vaccine hesitancy, but further elucidated the underlying reasons from the perspective of users, offering insights for research about the form, degree, and formation of echo chambers, along with depolarization, social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination pattern of topic, and sentiment. Therefore, this work can help to provide strategies for public health and public opinion managers to cooperate toward avoiding or correcting echo chamber chaos and effectively promoting online vaccine campaigns.","10.2196/40701","e40701","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000964999100004",NA,"Wang, Dandan/0000-0002-5319-5820",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44

The consumption of alcohol in adolescents is known to be influenced by seeing friends and even parents drinking alcohol. Building on this fact, a number of studies into alcohol consumption among adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to study the different social networks (peers, friends, family, etc.) with whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need an initial phase of data gathering by means of questionnaires and a subsequent analysis phase using the SNA techniques. The process involves a number of manual data handling stages that are time consuming and error-prone. The use of knowledge engineering techniques (including the construction of a domain ontology) to represent the information, allows the automation of all the activities, from the initial data collection to the results of the SNA study. This paper shows how a knowledge model is constructed, and compares the results obtained using the traditional method with this, fully automated model, detailing the main advantages of the latter.

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the \#5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. Results: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8\% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2\% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0\% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2\% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. Conclusions: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used. This study is the first to analyze the 5G conspiracy theory in the context of COVID-19 on Twitter offering practical guidance to health authorities in how, in the context of a pandemic, rumors may be combated in the future.","10.2196/19458","e19458","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000530598600001","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/P-5975-2017 Lopez Segui, Francesc/A-6483-2019 ","Vidal-Alaball, Josep/0000-0002-3527-4242 Lopez Segui, Francesc/0000-0003-0977-0215 Ahmed, Wasim/0000-0001-8923-1865",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46

Online-social-network-based parental-health-education is a potential way to reduce child unintentional injuries. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms by which online-social-network-based health education may reduce the unintentional injuries among children aged 0-3 years. MethodsWe conducted a participant-blinded, randomized controlled, online-social-network-based health-education intervention study from March 2019 to February 2020 in Shanghai. We established four WeChat groups (two intervention groups and two control groups). For the intervention groups, a doctor's assistant regularly delivered information regarding unintentional injuries among children, and community childcare doctors answered parents' questions concerning their children's health, including unintentional injuries. Meanwhile, the control groups did not receive any information from the assistant. The study selected one intervention group and one control group and compared the ego network and whole network indicators to determine the differences between the intervention and control groups. ResultsIn the intervention and control groups, 64.5\% and 31.9\% of the members, respectively, engaged in communication, and 1,736 and 273 records, respectively, were obtained. Regarding ego network, the doctor showed the largest network in the intervention group, and the size of the intervention group's network was twice that of the control group; the number of ties in the intervention group was nine times that of the control group. Fourteen and four parents in the intervention and control group played an active role, respectively. Regarding centrality, all WeChat groups were loose and multiple centers existed. Regarding subgroup cohesion, the intervention group had 28 cliques with 27 members, and the control group had 4 cliques with 4 members. For structural hole, 23.7\% and 7.5\% members in the intervention and control group actively participated in interactions, respectively, having strong control and influence over other parents; 69.2\% and 59.1\% members in the intervention and control group, respectively, had values of < 1.000, showing that they had strong ability to cross-jump structural holes. DiscussionOnline-social-networks-based health education interventions could enhance communication among parents, and between parents and community childcare doctors, and also shorten the social distance between them. Thus, online-social-network-based parental-health-education-intervention can be a feasible and generalizable means of preventing unintentional injuries among children.","10.3389/fpubh.2022.1049851","1049851",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000917837200001","Feng, Yuheng/JQX-2576-2023 lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,54

We divide these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events-and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.","10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177","102177","0306-4573","1873-5371","WOS:000510524700018","lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023 ","Liu, Zixuan/0000-0003-1778-3112",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,58

Data Sources We used 2018 National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems data, a nationally representative cohort of the US public health systems. Study Design Social network analysis measures were computed to indicate the extent of tribal organization participation in public health networks and to understand the sectors and social services that engage with tribal organizations in public health activities. Two-part regression models estimated predictors of tribal engagement. Data Collection A stratified random sample of local public health agencies was surveyed, yielding 574 respondents. An additional cohort of oversampled respondents was also surveyed to include jurisdictions from the entire state upon the request of their respective state health departments (n = 154). Analyses were restricted to jurisdictions with a nearby American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) serving health facility, yielding a final sample size of 258 local public health systems. Principal Findings When an AI/AN serving health facility was present in the region, tribal organizations participated in 28\% of public health networks and 9\% of implemented public health activities. Networks with tribal engagement were more comprehensive in terms of the breadth of sectors and social services participating in the network and the scope of public health activities implemented relative to networks without tribal engagement. The likelihood of tribal engagement increased significantly with the size of the AI/AN population, the presence of a tribal facility with Indian Health Service funding in the region, and geographic proximity to reservation land (p < 0.10). Conclusions The vast majority of public health networks do not report engagement with tribal organizations. Even when AI/AN serving health facilities are present, reported engagement of tribal organizations remains low.","10.1111/1475-6773.14012",NA,"0017-9124","1475-6773","WOS:000806587300001",NA,"Owsley, Kelsey/0000-0002-3745-4976 Bauer, Kyla/0000-0003-0074-6374","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,64

Detection of these groups can be helpful in many applications, such as finding networks of protein interaction in biological networks, finding the users of similar mind for ads and suggestions, finding a shared research field in collaborative networks, analyzing public health, future link prediction in social networks, analyzing criminology, and many more. However, with the increase in the number of profiles and content shared on social media platforms, the analysis is often time-consuming and exhaustive. In order to speed up and optimize the community detection process, parallel processing and Shared/Distributed memory techniques are widely used. Despite community detection has widespread use in social networks, no attempt has ever been made to compile and systematically discuss research efforts on the emerging subject of identifying parallel and distributed methods for community detection in social networks. Most of the surveys described the serial algorithms used for community detection. Our survey work comes under the scope of new design techniques, exciting or novel applications, components or standards, and applications of an educational, transactional, and co-operational nature. This paper accommodates and presents a systematic literature review with state-of-the-art research on the application of parallel processing and Shared/Distributed techniques to determine communities for social network analysis. Advanced search strategy has been performed on several digital libraries for extracting several studies for the review. The systematic search landed in finding 3220 studies, among which 65 relevant studies are selected after conducting various screening phases for further review. The application of parallel computing, shared memory, and distributed memory on the existing community detection methodologies have been discussed thoroughly. More specifically, the central significance of this paper is that a systematic literature review is conducted to gather the relevant studies from different digital libraries and gray literature. Then, different parametric values of each selected study are appropriately compared. Moreover, the need for further research to speed up the process of community formation in parallel and shared approaches has been pinpointed more suitably.

Decreased physical activity is one of the main societal changes driving the current obesity pandemic. Objective: Our goals are to fill a gap in the literature and study whether users organically utilize a social media platform, Twitter, for providing motivation. We examine the topics of messages and social network structures on Twitter. We discuss social media's potential for providing peer support and then draw insights to inform the development of interventions for long-term health-related behavior change. Methods: We examined motivational messages related to physical activity on Twitter. First, we collected tweets related to physical activity. Second, we analyzed them using (1) a lexicon-based approach to extract and characterize motivation-related tweets, (2) a thematic analysis to examine common themes in retweets, and (3) topic models to understand prevalent factors concerning motivation and physical activity on Twitter. Third, we created 2 social networks to investigate organically arising peer-support network structures for sustaining physical activity and to form a deeper understanding of the feasibility of these networks in a real-world context. Results: We collected over 1.5 million physical activity-related tweets posted from August 30 to November 6, 2018. A relatively small percentage of the tweets mentioned the term motivation; many of these were made on Mondays or during morning or late morning hours. The analysis of retweets showed that the following three themes were commonly conveyed on the platform: (1) using a number of different types of motivation (self, process, consolation, mental, or quotes), (2) promoting individuals or groups, and (3) sharing or requesting information. Topic models revealed that many of these users were weightlifters or people trying to lose weight. Twitter users also naturally forged relations, even though 98.12\% (2824/2878) of these users were in different physical locations. Conclusions: This study fills a knowledge gap on how individuals organically use social media to encourage and sustain physical activity. Elements related to peer support are found in the organic use of social media. Our findings suggest that geographical location is less important for providing peer support as long as the support provides motivation, despite users having few factors in common (eg, the weather) affecting their physical activity. This presents a unique opportunity to identify successful motivation-providing peer support groups in a large user base. However, further research on the effects in a real-world context, as well as additional design and usability features for improving user engagement, are warranted to develop a successful intervention counteracting the current obesity pandemic. This is especially important for young adults, the main user group for social media, as they develop lasting health-related behaviors.","10.2196/15055","e15055","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000966389600001",NA,"Park, Albert/0000-0002-2419-0131",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,72

Industry funding is contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network analysis. Methods We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of funding, and THR stance. Results About 284 (20\%) out of 1405 authors were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors. E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association with undisclosed industry support. Conclusions Authors with industry support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be necessary to achieve funding parity.","10.1093/ntr/ntac250",NA,"1462-2203","1469-994X","WOS:000885661300001","Hendlin, Yogi/Q-9777-2019 ","Hendlin, Yogi/0000-0002-1714-6132 Vassey, Julia/0000-0003-3002-2000","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,74

Social network analysis of top influencers, associated hashtags, and keywords was performed to understand the context of the posts. With over 60 000 tweets reaching more than 250 million impressions, World Hypertension Day was a highly impactful event. A large spike of over 800\% yearly increase was seen in 2021 that has greatly facilitated wider dissemination. However, there was limited collaboration among the top influencers and negligible participation from several African and non-English-speaking European countries. Conclusion With support from several governmental bodies, organizations and media outlets, World Hypertension Day is a highly impactful healthcare awareness day and presents a global case study of effectively utilizing digital resources for creating awareness among the global audience.

Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.","10.1038/s41562-020-0898-6",NA,"2397-3374",NA,"WOS:000538012000001","Dowd, Jennifer/C-1127-2012 ","Hoffman, Marion/0000-0002-0741-7760 Dowd, Jennifer/0000-0003-2006-5656 Block, Per/0000-0002-7583-2392 Kashyap, Ridhi/0000-0003-0615-2868","JUN 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,83

Eliminating the disease requires collaboration among important government, community, healthcare providers and non-governmental organizations representatives working on schistosomiasis. The current level of cooperation and collaboration among these representatives in Oyo state, Nigeria is unknown. This study aimed to measure the extent and strength of collaboration among these representatives looking at three relationships: contact, collaboration and resource sharing activities using social network analysis method. Undertaking this research will support a better understanding of barriers against meeting the disease elimination deadline. The social network analysis found that the three relationships patterns had considerable clustering among representatives and few connections, signifying low interconnectedness across several representative groups. The contact and collaborative relationships were the most active, with the resource-sharing network having the lowest amount of interconnectedness. Representatives were more active in rural areas than urban, and representatives in the organized government and the public health system were the most active actors in the schistosomiasis control program. The schistosomiasis control program's representative's poor connectedness, unbalanced relationships patterns should be addressed in order to stimulate improvement and reach the WHO schistosomiasis elimination objective. BackgroundSchistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by 2030. Achieving disease elimination requires collaboration between stakeholders, country ownership and the involvement of community-level stakeholders. The state of stakeholder relationship determines the ease and timeliness of meeting disease elimination targets. Mapping stakeholder relationships is critical for assessing gaps in the schistosomiasis control program implementation, and providing a roadmap for improved stakeholder cohesion. The study aimed to measure the cohesiveness of the contact, collaboration and resource-sharing networks, across 2 local government areas in Oyo state, Nigeria. Materials and methodsThis study used a Network Representative design for Social Network Analysis (SNA). The study was conducted within Oyo state, Nigeria using 2 Local Government Areas (LGAs): Ibadan North (urban) and Akinyele (rural). Stakeholders were identified using a link-tracing approach. Data was collected using Qualtrics software from stakeholders across the state, local government, healthcare, academia, and non-governmental organizations. Data was analysed using Gephi software for network cohesion across the three networks. ResultsThe social network analysis revealed high clustering and low density across the three networks implying low cohesion across multiple stakeholder categories. The contact and collaborative networks were the most active with the lowest level of cohesion seen in the resource-sharing network. Stakeholders were more active in the rural LGA than the urban, and stakeholders within the organized governance and public health system were the dominant actors in the schistosomiasis control program. ConclusionThe low cohesion, high clustering and low network density among stakeholders within the schistosomiasis control program should be addressed in other to drive innovation and meet the WHO schistosomiasis elimination target.","10.1371/journal.pntd.0011266","e0011266","1935-2735",NA,"WOS:000970599600001","Diehl, Jan Carel/L-6621-2013","Onasanya, Adeola/0000-0001-9599-4316 Diehl, Jan Carel/0000-0002-4007-2282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,87

This study particularly focuses on the evolution of intra- and inter-sectoral collaboration ties in the network. The data for the study were collected through a content analysis of government documents and news articles. Using social network analysis, the authors found that the network evolved into a centralized structure around a small number of governmental organizations at the central level, organizing the ties between participating organizations rather hierarchically. The network displayed a preponderance of internal ties both among health and non-health organizations and among public and nonpublic health organizations, but under different influences of structural characteristics. This tendency was intensified during the peak period. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the centralization of disaster management may not or only marginally be conducive to cross-sector collaboration during public health disasters, calling for a careful design of governance structures for disaster response.","10.3390/ijerph19010018","18",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000752645300001",NA,"Han, Ahreum/0000-0001-6519-0579 Lee, Keon-Hyung/0000-0003-1885-4314",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89

This study applied social network analysis to examine whether adolescents with more pain problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents with similar pain problems name each other more often as being part of the same peer group (RQ2), dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship qualities (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate the relationship between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study used data from the first wave of a longitudinal study (N = 2767) which followed up Swedish adolescents from 19 public schools. For RQ1-3, Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was applied. For RQ4, standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents with less pain problems.

First, unrealized or newly emerging relationships among planned actors contributed to the low congruence. Second, the response plan overlooked the role and relationships of several intermediary actors between the local and national actors in the government system.

During these times of uncertainty and crisis, people have turned to social media platforms as communication tools and primary information sources. Online discourse is conducted under the influence of many different factors, such as background, culture, politics, etc. However, parallel comparative research studies conducted in different countries to identify similarities and differences in online discourse are still scarce.

Some researchers anticipate benefits stemming from improved public awareness of the value of vaccines while others worry concerns around vaccine development and public health mandates may have damaged public trust. There is a need to understand whether the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine mandates have influenced HPV vaccine attitudes and sentiments to inform health communication strategies.MethodsWe collected 596,987 global English-language tweets from January 2019-May 2021 using Twitter's Academic Research Product track. We determined vaccine confident and hesitant networks discussing HPV immunization using social network analysis. Then, we used a neural network approach to natural language processing to measure narratives and sentiment pertaining to HPV immunization.ResultsMost of the tweets in the vaccine hesitant network were negative in tone (54.9\%) and focused on safety concerns surrounding the HPV vaccine while most of the tweets in the vaccine confident network were neutral (51.6\%) and emphasized the health benefits of vaccination. Growth in negative sentiment among the vaccine hesitant network corresponded with legislative efforts in the State of New York to mandate HPV vaccination for public school students in 2019 and the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a Global Health Emergency in 2020. In the vaccine confident network, the number of tweets concerning the HPV vaccine decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic but in both vaccine hesitant and confident networks, the sentiments, and themes of tweets about HPV vaccine were unchanged.ConclusionsAlthough we did not observe a difference in narratives or sentiments surrounding the HPV vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased focus on the HPV vaccine among vaccine confident groups. As routine vaccine catch-up programs restart, there is a need to invest in health communication online to raise awareness about the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine.","10.1186/s12889-023-15615-w","694",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000969776100001","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/JLK-8537-2023 ","Jessiman-Perreault, Genevieve/0000-0002-2755-7891 Boucher, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-5529-6572",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96

Timely and effective communication is essential for response to such incidents. However, the emergency response to such incidents usually lasts longer and break out repeatedly, and the existing static emergency communication network (ECN) analysis cannot fully reflect the dynamic information interaction between organizations during the emergency process. Therefore, this article takes the recent COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China as a case, and uses social network analysis to reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks, positions, roles, and tasks of organizations from the time dimension. The results show that: (1) the ECN has changed from concentrated to decentralized over time; (2) the positions and roles of participating organizations in the ECN has changed, but there are still a few key organizations that at the central position in all phases of emergency communication; (3) the core tasks have changed due to emergency needs at each stage; (4) under the concentrated management system, the core organization of the ECN mainly comes from government organizations. The research results reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks between different types of emergency organizations, which is beneficial to guide emergency management of public health emergencies. In actual emergency, the emergency communication mode should be dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of the emergency situation at different stages, comprehensively using the advantages of the concentrated and decentralized emergency network. In addition, communication between different types of organizations such as governments, research institutions, and enterprises should be strengthened, and channels for diversified organizations to participate in emergency communication should be set up. The research helps to improve communication between emergency response organizations and is of great significance to controlling and reducing the harm caused by public health emergencies.","10.1007/s11069-021-04908-1",NA,"0921-030X","1573-0840","WOS:000670199100001",NA,NA,"JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,99

We also identified certain relevant sectors not to be part of the network. We discuss that the success of the network depends on the members' active participation in and their outreach beyond the existing network, between city and county levels, and across sectors to promote health and build health-promoting structures in the region.","10.3390/ijerph18168372","8372",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000690517700001","Frahsa, Annika/P-7574-2019 ","Frahsa, Annika/0000-0002-0207-3989 Thiel, Ansgar/0000-0001-9217-0442",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,102

The network is composed of 6477 vertices with 59\% of them concentred in a giant component clustered around London and Milton Keynes. We found minimal disassortative mixing by degree between sex workers and their clients, and that a few clients and sex workers are highly connected whilst the majority only have one or few sexual contacts. Finally, our simulation models suggested that prevention strategies targeting both sex workers and clients with high centrality scores are the most effective in reducing network connectedness and average closeness centrality scores, thus limiting the transmission of STIs.","10.1080/13691058.2020.1788725",NA,"1369-1058","1464-5351","WOS:000567004900001",NA,"Melendez-Torres, G.J./0000-0002-9823-4790 Giommoni, Luca/0000-0002-3127-654X Berlusconi, Giulia/0000-0003-4654-1059","JUL 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,103

The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help ``prove{''} that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the \#FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.","10.1177/2053951720938405","2053951720938405","2053-9517",NA,"WOS:000554923700001",NA,"Mai, Philip/0000-0002-6950-1220 Gruzd, Anatoliy/0000-0003-2366-5163",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,106

The severity of the disease depends on the route, dose and frequency of infection. Group-living social mammals thus have the ability to exacerbate the spread of the disease. LionsPanthera leoare social carnivores with individuals interacting on a regular basis. We used observations of lion behaviours to define potential transmission routes between individuals and the likely spread of diseases in the lion population of the Kruger National Park. This allowed description of the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis to mimic and predict the potential rate of horizontal disease transmission within lion prides. Social network analysis allowed us to identify the most important pride members and the implications of interactions with these members for spreading disease in prides. Three prides in the southern region of the Kruger National Park comprised degrees of relatedness within prides that predict variable links between pride members. The interactive behaviour of young lions with each other, a key element of learning in social mammals, play a key role in dictating contact rates that enhance disease transmission. Even so, within prides,R-0< 1 predicts that bovine tuberculosis should disappear from a pride. Persistence of the disease as noted for lions in Kruger can only realize through unlikely transmissions or through feeding on infected prey. Our results support lions as a spill-over host.","10.1007/s13364-020-00526-7",NA,"2199-2401","2199-241X","WOS:000563784100001",NA,"Mzileni, Nkabeng/0000-0002-7628-5327 Goodall, Victoria/0000-0002-9448-5664","AUG 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,111

Social network analysis (SNA) generates data on hyperlocal social-demographic structures that contribute to disease transmission.MethodsWe collected social contact data in five villages and built SNA-informed village-specific stochastic TB transmission models in remote Madagascar. A name-generator approach was used to elicit individual contact networks. Recruitment included confirmed TB patients, followed by snowball sampling of named contacts. Egocentric network data were aggregated into village-level networks. Network- and individual-level characteristics determining contact formation and structure were identified by fitting an exponential random graph model (ERGM), which formed the basis of the contact structure and model dynamics. Models were calibrated and used to evaluate WHO-recommended interventions and community resiliency to foreign TB introduction.ResultsInter- and intra-village SNA showed variable degrees of interconnectivity, with transitivity (individual clustering) values of 0.16, 0.29, and 0.43. Active case finding and treatment yielded 67\%-79\% reduction in active TB disease prevalence and a 75\% reduction in TB mortality in all village networks. Following hypothetical TB elimination and without specific interventions, networks A and B showed resilience to both active and latent TB reintroduction, while Network C, the village network with the highest transitivity, lacked resiliency to reintroduction and generated a TB prevalence of 2\% and a TB mortality rate of 7.3\% after introduction of one new contagious infection post hypothetical elimination.ConclusionIn remote Madagascar, SNA-informed models suggest that WHO-recommended interventions reduce TB disease (active TB) prevalence and mortality while TB infection (latent TB) burden remains high. Communities' resiliency to TB introduction decreases as their interconnectivity increases. ``Top down{'' population level TB models would most likely miss this difference between small communities.

Methodological advances permit simultaneous modeling of these contexts to understand their relative and joint importance. Few empirical studies include these contexts, and studies that do typically: examine each context separately; include contexts for the sole purpose of accounting for clustering in the data; or do not disaggregate by sex.Objectives: This study takes an eco-epidemiologic approach to examine the role of socio-contextual contributions to variance in adolescent alcohol use. The primary parameters of interest are therefore variance rather than beta parameters (i.e. random rather than fixed effects). Sex-stratified models are also used to understand how each context may matter differently for male and female adolescents.Method: Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 8,534 females, n = 8,102 males). We conduct social network analysis and traditional and cross-classified multilevel models (CCMM) in the full and sex-disaggregated samples.Results: In final CCMM, peer groups, schools, and neighborhoods contributed 10.5\%, 10.8\%, and 0.4\%, respectively, to total variation in adolescent alcohol use. Results do not differ widely by gender.Conclusions: Peer groups and schools emerge as more salient contributing contexts relative to neighborhoods in adolescent alcohol use for males and females. These findings have both methodological and practical implications. Multilevel modeling can model contexts simultaneously to prevent the overestimation of variance in youth alcohol use explained by each context. Primary prevention strategies addressing youth alcohol use should focus on schools and peer networks.","10.1080/00952990.2023.2222431",NA,"0095-2990","1097-9891","WOS:001024903500001","Barker, Kathryn/KBD-4684-2024",NA,"JUL 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,115

Compared to 3\% of prescriptions (involving 6\% of prescribers and 7\% of beneficiaries) that directed >= 90 MME/day, discoordination accounted for a greater share of high-risk exposures-13\% of prescriptions (involving 23\% of prescribers and 24\% of beneficiaries). The following specialties were at highest risk of discoordinated prescribing compared to internal medicine: dental (incident rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) 5.9 (4.6, 7.5)), emergency medicine (4.7 (3.8, 5.8)), and surgical subspecialties (4.2 (3.0, 5.8)). Social network analysis identified 2 small interconnected prescriber communities of high-volume pain management specialists, and 3 sparsely connected groups of predominantly low-volume primary care or emergency medicine clinicians. Using multivariate models, we found that the sparsely connected sociometric positions were a risk factor for high-risk exposures.ConclusionLow-volume prescribers in the social network's periphery were at greater risk of intended or discoordinated prescribing than interconnected high-volume prescribers. Interventions addressing discoordination among low-volume opioid prescribers in non-integrated practices should be a priority. Demands for enhanced functionality and integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs or referrals to specialized multidisciplinary pain management centers are potential policy implications.","10.1007/s11606-019-05114-3",NA,"0884-8734","1525-1497","WOS:000495795700037","Aks, Steven/AAF-1924-2020 ","Hinami, Keiki/0000-0002-1927-2546 Trick, William/0000-0002-3243-5098",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,117

May is recognized as Stroke Awareness Month to involve the concerned stakeholders. The goal of this month is to raise public awareness of the risk factors for stroke and to minimize its occurrence. We, for the first time, evaluated the actual impact of this awareness campaign to formulate evidence-based recommendations to promote stroke awareness.Methods: The total number of tweets posted in the month of May from 2014 to 2022 were extracted. The search queries used were ``stroke awareness month OR stroke month OR \#strokemonth OR \#strokewarenessmonth{''} and ``stroke OR \#stroke{''}. Social network analysis of the tweets was done to understand the context of posts. Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and gives insights into useful information about impact, reach, and interactions in an environment. The top 100 related hashtags, influencers, and keywords were extracted. Beyond social media usage, Google Trends web search analysis was done for the search term `stroke awareness month' for interest by region of the last five years to get an overall idea of the internet search trends globally.Results: Out of the total 989,935 tweets about stroke posted in May 2022, only 1.07\% of the tweets were specific to Stroke Awareness Month. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage of targeted action from 2014 to 2022 have been 3.14\% and 1.35\%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the top users never collaborated with each other. On Google Trends analysis, the event had primary involvement from the United States and the United Kingdom.

Theme trends were investigated using evolutionary analysis with the SciMAT software. In total, 1,305 papers were analyzed. The research output on the dietary factors associated with MetS increased steadily. The research scope was gradually expanding and diverse. Overall, eight research hot spots, four key dietary nodes, and four motor themes on the dietary factors associated with MetS were identified. Fatty acids, dietary fiber, and polyphenols have been the focus of research in this field over the years. Evolutionary analysis showed that fish oil and vitamin C were well-developed research foci recently. Prebiotics was recognized as an emerging theme with certain developmental potential. These findings provide a better understanding of the research status of the dietary factors associated with MetS and a reference for future investigations.","10.3389/fnut.2021.655533","655533","2296-861X",NA,"WOS:000661012700001","wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023 liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023 Wu, Lijuan/JJG-0701-2023 Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023 li, Li/JPA-0218-2023 zhou, xian/JYQ-9844-2024 Wang, Guanhua/JXM-6373-2024 Zhang, Tie-Ning/GPK-5202-2022 XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023 liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023 Liu, Kai/IST-6808-2023 wen, Wen/KBB-1727-2024 chen, yuying/JNS-9778-2023 Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023 ","Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156 Wu, Qi-Jun/0000-0001-9421-5114 Zhang, Tie-Ning/0000-0003-4954-5370 cao, xia/0000-0001-9228-276X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,137

A Network Analysis of Campaign-Style Enforcement in China","SUSTAINABILITY",2019,"11","2",NA,"JAN 2","Haze pollution has become one of the most important environment problems in China, raising increasing serious public health concerns. When carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's structure, and the centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure of the enforcement network became flatter, with a horizontal' management arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy implementation.","10.3390/su11020340","340",NA,"2071-1050","WOS:000457129900044","3107-2022 ","0000-0001-9631-9283 wu, jian nan/0000-0003-1795-7266",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,138

We used a mixed-methods approach to assess collaborative relationships between multiple government sectors and civil society and to suggest possible health promotion interventions and policy alternatives for the urban poor in deprived neighborhoods. A total of 18 participants involved in health promotion interventions and policy processes related to the inner-city area of Seoul were recruited using purposive sampling methods. Participants included stakeholders working for or engaging in governments (3), public health care institutions (5), social service providers (3), community-based organisations (CBOs) (4) and faith-based organisations (3). We conducted semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and then collected survey data. Quantitative data were analysed using social network analysis, and qualitative data were analysed through iterative and consensus processes. The social network analysis indicated that a CBO plays the most substantial role in sharing and controlling informational resources to promote health. A stakeholder analysis showed that the CBO neutrally and negatively viewed the possibility of collaboration with other stakeholders. Three themes related to challenges to intersectoral collaboration emerged: (1) lack of trust and communication, (2) need of a coalition with a committed leading actor for future collaboration and (3) organisational and political silos within and across public sectors. Increased understanding of the current status of and challenges to collaboration can inform the planning and implementation of complex intervening strategies and policies tailored to vulnerable people in deprived neighborhoods. Community-led collaborative actions empower people in marginalised communities to envision a healthier community.","10.1177/1757975918791517",NA,"1757-9759","1757-9767","WOS:000543978800006",NA,"Chung, Haejoo/0000-0002-2661-4161 Heo, Hyun-Hee/0000-0002-8046-2752",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,139

We aimed to identify network measures used in studies on adolescent health behaviours.Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify network measures in studies investigating adolescent health behaviours with SNA. Measures were grouped into eight categories based on network concepts commonly described in the literature: popularity, position within the network, network density, similarity, nature of relationships, peer behaviours, social norms, and selection and influence mechanisms. Different subcategories were further identified. We detailed all distinct measures and the labels used to name them in included articles.Results Out of 6686 articles screened, 201 were included. The categories most frequently investigated were peer behaviours (n=201, 100\%), position within the network (n=144, 71.6\%) and popularity (n=110, 54.7\%). The number of measurement methods varied from 1 for `similarity on popularity' (within the `similarity' category) to 28 for the `characterisation of the relationship between the respondent and nominated peers' (within the `nature of the relationships' category). Using the examples of `social isolation', `group membership', `individuals in a central position' (within the `position within the network' category) and `nominations of influential peers' (sub within the `popularity' category), we illustrated the inconsistent reporting and heterogeneity in measurement methods and semantics.Conclusion Robust methodological recommendations are needed to harmonise network measures in order to facilitate comparison across studies and optimise public health intervention based on SNA.","10.1136/jech-2023-220980",NA,"0143-005X","1470-2738","WOS:001153345300001",NA,NA,"JAN 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,140

The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55\%). Backyard producers made up 89\% of the network premises, and the top 2\% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50\% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to improve its procedures and update the disease control and management policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based surveillance.","10.1111/tbed.14640",NA,"1865-1674","1865-1682","WOS:000825780500001","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Grisi-Filho, Jose/J-2523-2012 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 Ferreira, Fernando/C-9038-2013 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Amaku, Marcos/0000-0003-4752-6774 Grisi-Filho, Jose/0000-0002-3263-2147 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353 Pisuna Torres, Luis Enrique/0000-0002-1272-3981 Vinueza, Rommel Lenin/0000-0002-4587-8795 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Ferreira, Fernando/0000-0002-9160-7355 ardila galvis, jason/0000-0003-2811-7684","JUL 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,149

To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel multivariate spatio-network model for jointly modelling all three of these behaviours, with inference conducted in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model is motivated by survey data from five schools in Los Angeles, California, and the results indicate the important roles that individual factors and friendship networks play in driving the uptake of these health behaviours.","10.1111/rssc.12531",NA,"0035-9254","1467-9876","WOS:000722928100001","Lee, Duncan/HPH-6789-2023 ","Gerogiannis, George/0000-0001-6067-0047","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,150

Measure the extent to which companies target payments at the same recipients in each country and whether it differs depending on the type of recipient. Design Cross-sectional comparative and social network analysis. Setting England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland. Participants 100 donors (pharmaceutical companies) reporting payments to 4229 recipients (healthcare organisations and patient organisations) in 2015. Main outcome measures For each country: payment totals and distribution; average number of common recipients between companies; share of payments to organisations fulfilling different roles in the health ecosystem and payments for different activities. Results Companies prioritised different types of recipient and different types of activity in each country. There were significant differences in the distribution of payments across the four countries, even for similar types of recipients. Recipients in England and Wales received smaller individual payments than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Overall, targeting shared recipients occurred most frequently in England, but was also common in certain pockets of each country's health ecosystem. We found evidence of reporting errors in Disclosure UK. Conclusions Our findings suggest a strategic approach to payments tailored to countries' policy and decision-making context, indicating there may be specific vulnerabilities to financial conflicts of interest at subnational level. Payment differences between countries may be occurring in other countries, particularly those with decentralised health systems and/or high levels of independence across its decision-making authorities.

Specifically, we wanted to determine whether the patterns of connectivity over time can predict future infections, and whether this pattern can distinguish between different sources of infection. The study population included 13,409 individuals nested in a larger population of birds that were closely monitored in zoological facilities for over 22 years (1992-2014). A retrospective cohort study design and social network connectivity were used to estimate the association between exposure to an infected bird, and development of mycobacteriosis. Avian mycobacteriosis was diagnosed from histopathology and network connectivity was defined by enclosure histories over discrete time periods. Single-variable and multivariable longitudinal, mixed effects logistic regression models examined whether exposure to infected birds, both directly- and indirectly-connected, was associated with development of mycobacteriosis at the next time step. Our adjusted model showed an increased odds of developing mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 2.15; 95 \% CI: 1.48 3.12; p < 0.001) for birds that were directly exposed (i.e., housed in the same aviary) to another infected bird, compared to those with no exposure. Exposure to a positive, indirectly-connected bird at a previous time step was independently associated with an increased risk of mycobacteriosis (odds ratio = 1.56; 95 \% CI: 1.11 2.19). This association persisted in adjusted models even when the indirect contacts were housed in distinctly different aviaries and never had contact with the subject of interest or its environment. Adjusted, risk-stratified models further characterized the type of exposure that increased the risk of avian mycobacteriosis. Birds that were exposed in small aviaries were more likely to develop mycobacteriosis than those exposed in larger aviaries and those with no exposure. The lesion distribution and species of the contact (same species versus different species) were also significant predictors of disease risk. Some findings were sensitive to model variation of time divisions and initiation time. Our study shows avian mycobacteriosis spread through the social network in quantifiable and discernable patterns. We provide empirical evidence that a contagious process drives some of the observed infection, but we also show low transmissibility based on sustained patterns of low incidence over time even when large groups of birds are exposed. Targeted risk mitigation efforts based on the characteristics of the exposure may be effective at reducing risk of avian mycobacteriosis while enhancing population sustainability.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105415","105415","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000675466300004","Fowler, James H/C-2750-2008 ","Witte, Carmel/0000-0001-9086-3333","JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,158

Network composition may affect priorities, processes, and the reach of health information to key stakeholders. This study seeks to elucidate variation in local network structures to examine how different constellations may affect information sharing across audiences. Design: This study analyzes data from a 2016 US survey of 491 metropolitan LHDs and 556 nonmetropolitan LHDs. Researchers first conducted social network analysis of network density, defined as the total number of potential organizations contributing to a jurisdiction's health communication activities. Researchers then conducted logistic regression to compare the relationship between network density and reported health communication activities targeting 3 specific audiences: policy makers, lay publics, and mass media. Results: Three network types emerged on the basis of the number of organizations that contribute to health communication activities, with low-density Minimal networks more common in nonmetropolitan jurisdictions and higher-density Expanded and Robust networks more common in metropolitan jurisdictions. LHDs in Minimal networks were significantly less likely to communicate with policy makers, lay publics, and mass media than their counterparts in higher-density networks (P < .05). Conclusions: LHDs are embedded in organizational communication networks that vary in both the number of communication partners and the types of audiences reached. Examining their own local organizational communication networks may provide insights into LHDs that wish to improve the effectiveness of public health messaging. By adding organizational communication partners and reaching new audiences, LHDs in Minimal networks can expand the reach of messages designed to help policy makers, communities, and individuals promote health and prevent disease.","10.1097/PHH.0000000000001265",NA,"1078-4659","1550-5022","WOS:000675577300016",NA,"Hoover, Anna/0000-0002-3996-3571",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,161

Systems science may be well suited to tackle such wicked problems. While there is a growing application of systems thinking tools and resources in public health, there are fewer examples that incorporate both systems tools and systemic inquiry processes. Prevention Tracker offered an opportunity to trial the combination of systems tools and systems thinking at the level of community chronic disease prevention efforts. Our methodology comprised four Domains of Inquiry. 1. Describing a prevention system 2. Guiding system change efforts 3. Monitoring change 4. Cross case comparison. We applied systems tools and methods to investigate each domain of inquiry such as group model building, social network analysis, graphic illustration, causal loop diagrams and system action learning. These methods were connected through the application of systemic inquiry processes that elevated the ongoing interrogation of boundary judgments, awareness of diverse and multiple perspectives, interrelationships and the importance of social learning. Prevention Tracker demonstrated that it is possible to apply a range of systems methods while also keeping focus on the overall systems science and the need for theoretical consistency.

With the greater uptake of orthodontic treatment in recent decades, it can be assumed that fixed braces are increasingly perceived as normal or even socially desirable. This study investigated how wearing visible fixed braces affects adolescents' social position in their peer networks using cross-sectional survey data.Methods A total of 3002 students in the seventh grade (ages 12/13) at 39 secondary schools were asked about their social relationships in school. These directed network data were used to compare different indegrees (friendship, popularity and victimisation) of students with and without fixed braces. Statistical analyses were performed using ordinary least squares multiple regression models with school cohort fixed effects.Results In all, 19\% of the surveyed students indicated that they wear visible fixed braces. Girls with fixed braces were slightly more likely to be nominated for friendship and popularity and slightly less likely to be nominated for victimisation than girls without fixed braces (p < 0.05). These associations also remained stable when controlling for socioeconomic differences. Among boys, all observed associations were statistically insignificant.Conclusion We found no evidence that wearing fixed braces in adolescence is socially sanctioned by peers. Rather, female students with fixed braces even tend to hold a slightly more favourable position in their peer networks than girls without braces do. These analyses exemplify how network-analytic approaches can be successfully applied in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of sociology, epidemiology and medicine.","10.1007/s00056-023-00506-x",NA,"1434-5293","1615-6714","WOS:001127631200001",NA,NA,"DEC 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,164

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. Objective: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. Methods: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. Results: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2\% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4\%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9\% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.","10.2196/22609","e22609","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000602398100006","Al-Khalifa, Hend/AAY-5219-2020 alSaeed, Duaa/AAU-9469-2020 Al-Khalifa, Hend S./F-3945-2011 AlBaity, Heyam/AAJ-7949-2021","Al-Khalifa, Hend/0000-0002-7328-4935 alSaeed, Duaa/0000-0002-8464-7279 Al-Khalifa, Hend S./0000-0002-7328-4935 AlBaity, Heyam/0000-0002-4590-3399",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165

Design: This study used a social network analysis (SNA) approach to assess the Million Hearts initiative network partnerships and identify potential implications for policy and practice. Setting/Participants: The Million Hearts network comprised a core group of federal and private sector partners that participate in Million Hearts activities and align with initiative priorities. To bound the network for the SNA, we used a list of 58 organizations (74\% response rate) from a previously completed qualitative analysis of Million Hearts partnerships. Main Outcome Measures: We used the online PARTNER (Program to Analyze Record and Track Networks to Enhance Relationships-) survey to collect data on individual organizational characteristics and relational questions that asked organizations to identify and describe their relationships with other partners in the network. Key SNA measures include network density, centralizations, value, and trust. Results: Our analyses show a network that is decentralized, has strong perceptions of trust and value among its members, and strong agreement on intended outcomes. Interestingly, partners report a desire and ability to contribute resources to Million Hearts; however, the perceptions between partners are that resources are not being contributed at the level they potentially could be. The majority of partners reported that being in the network helped them achieve their goals related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The largest barrier to successful activities within the network was cited as lack of targeted funding and staff to support participation in the network. Conclusions: The Million Hearts network described in this article is unique in its membership at the national level, agreement on outcomes, its powerful information-sharing abilities that require few resources, and its decentralized structure. We identified strategies that could be implemented to strengthen the network and its activities. By examining a national-level public-private partnership formed to address a public health issue, we can identify ways to strengthen the network and provide a framework for developing other initiatives.","10.1097/PHH.0000000000000781",NA,"1078-4659","1550-5022","WOS:000458115900012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170

Excluding Thailand, publications on risk factors for OV-CCA from the GMS Countries are few, especially data on behavioral risk factors for OV-CCA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the behavior-related risk factors and to compare the risk of OV-CCA among rural people living along the Mekong River in five GMS countries. It was a cross-sectional analytic study during June and October 2017. All participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of risk factors. Odds ratio with 95\% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk of OV-CCA. It was found that there were more drinkers than non-drinkers in all areas, except in Vietnam. The highest history of liver fluke infection was found in Cambodia. Praziquantel use and consumption of raw freshwater fish dishes were mostly found in Lao PDR. The highest consumption of nitrosamine-contaminated foodstuffs was found in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. The spatial comparison of OV-CCA risk showed that Lao PDR and Ubon Ratchathani were two risk areas when compared to Tachileik, Myanmar (a reference area). This study provided the behavior-related risk factors for OV-CCA among people in five GMS Countries which would be a major jigsaw puzzle leading to proactive surveillance for OV-CCA prevention in the future.","10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.105221","105221","0001-706X","1873-6254","WOS:000500186700027","Le, Cua Ngoc/IRZ-5264-2023 ","Sripa, Banchob/0000-0001-8899-5919 Nguyen, Thi To Uyen/0000-0003-3049-4841 Le, Cua Ngoc/0000-0001-5634-7669",NA,"NTD-Asia-International-Research-Network Conference, Khon Kean, THAILAND, AUG 07-09, 2019","NTD Asia Int Res Network",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,171

Recently, the National Veterinary Service (NVS), has dedicated its efforts to control the disease by implementing pig identification, mandatory vaccination against CSF and movement control. Our objective was to characterise pig premises according to risk criteria, to model the effect of movement restriction strategies and to consider the temporal evolution of the network. Social network analysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network modelling and temporal analysis were used. The network contained 751,003 shipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. Participating premises consisted of 144,118 backyard farms, 138 industrial farms, 21,337 traders and 51 markets. The 10 most influential markets, in the Andean highlands, received between 500 and 4600 pigs each week. The 10 most influential traders made about 3 shipments with 17 pigs per week. Simulations without control strategy resulted in an average CSF prevalence of 14.4 \%; targeted movement restriction reduced the prevalence to 7.2 \%, while with random movement restriction it was 13 \%. Targeting the top 10 national traders and markets and one of the high-risk premises in every parish was one of the best strategies with the surveillance infrastructure available, highlighting its major influence and epidemiological importance in the network. When comparing the static network with its temporal counterpart, causal fidelity (c = 0.62) showed a 38 \% overestimation in the number of transmission paths, also traversing the network required 4.39 steps, lasting approximately 233 days. In conclusion, NVS surveillance strategies could be more efficient by targeting the most at-risk premises, and in particular, taking into account the temporal information would make the risk assessment much more precise. This information could contribute to implement risk-based surveillance reducing the time to eradicate CSF and other infectious animal diseases.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105683","105683","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000833401100005","Acosta, Alfredo/Q-7728-2017 Amaku, Marcos/D-5252-2012 Dietze, Klaas/JJF-6743-2023 Goncalves, Vitor/H-2688-2012 ","Acosta, Alfredo/0000-0001-9627-3094 Dietze, Klaas/0000-0002-6138-6707 Goncalves, Vitor/0000-0001-5083-9224 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

By analyzing different patterns of normative influence associated with cervical cancer detection among Latinas (N = 982), the study concludes that network brokerage provides individuals with nonredundant information, helps resist normative pressure, and contributes to efficacy beliefs, promoting more informed decision making. Conversely, network closure perpetuates conformity, increases the influence of social norms, and induces less confidence in individual's ability to comply with cervical cancer screening, subjecting Latinas to unnecessary health risks. Overall, the results suggest that the study of normative influence should be combined with social network analysis, trying to shed a light on the distinct social structures and communication practices that can either reinforce or challenge norms. These findings extend the discussion of social norms in health-related decision making to a more nuanced approach that recognizes the antecedents and outcomes of normative influence.","10.1177/0093650217718655",NA,"0093-6502","1552-3810","WOS:000469841700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,174

Community-clinical partnerships offer particular promise, but delivery and sustainment of preventive services through these systems face several challenges related to service integration and collaboration. We used a social network analysis perspective to explore (a) the range of contributions made by community-clinical partnership network members to support the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and (b) important influences on the ability of these partnerships to sustain service delivery. Methods:Data come from an implementation evaluation of the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund initiative, which supported nine Massachusetts communities to coordinate delivery of evidence-based prevention and address inequities in hypertension, pediatric asthma, falls among older adults, or tobacco use. In 2016, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (a) leadership teams representing nine community-level partnerships and (b) practitioners from four high-implementation partnerships (n= 23). We managed data using NVivo11 and utilized a framework analysis approach. Results:Key network contributions for delivery of evidence-based preventive services included creating referrals, delivering services, providing links to community members, and administration and leadership. Less emphasized contributions included wraparound services, technical assistance, and venue provision. Implementers from high-implementation partnerships also highlighted contributions such as program adaptation, creating buy-in, and sharing information to improve service delivery. Expected drivers of program sustainability included the ability to develop a business case, ongoing network facilitation, technology support, continued integrated action, and sufficient staffing to maintain programming. Conclusion:The study highlights the need to take a long-term, infrastructure-focused approach when designing community-clinical partnerships. Strategic partnership composition, including identifying sources of necessary network contributions, in conjunction with efforts from the outset to link systems, align effort, and build a long-term funding structure can support the required coordinated action around preventive services needed to improve health equity.","10.3389/fpubh.2020.00213","213",NA,"2296-2565","WOS:000551642900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,184

Then, we collect 820 questionnaires from three provinces in northeast Thailand to visualize their fish-sharing and sharing-procurement networks, analyze how the connectivity differences in these networks might be linked to participants' consumption behaviors and environmental settings, and determine how all these together affect liver fluke infection risks. The results show that infection was positively associated with procuring fish from ponds, but negatively associated with procuring fish from rivers. Incorporating fish procurement sites substantially increases network connectivity, reinforcing the human connection to key fish sources as a potential risk factor for infection. The consideration of the connections between human, disease hosts, and the environment, compared to the previously human-centric approach of deworming, offers new insights for public health intervention.","10.1080/24694452.2023.2277807",NA,"2469-4452","2469-4460","WOS:001138532800001","Sithithaworn, Paiboon/E-4378-2019 ","Sithithaworn, Paiboon/0000-0002-9480-1778 Law, Andrea/0000-0003-3359-3263","NOV 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,185

Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95\% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20\%) exporting/importing more than 90\% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements.

Numerous articles related to ADHD have been published in the literature. However, which articles had ultimate influence is still unknown, and what factors affect the number of article citations remains unclear as well. This bibliometric analysis (1) visualizes the prominent entities with 1 picture using the top 100 most-cited articles, and (2) investigates whether medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms) can be used in predicting article citations. Methods: By searching the PubMed Central (R) (PMC) database, the top 100 most-cited abstracts relevant to ADHD since 2014 were downloaded. Citation rank analysis was performed to compare the dominant roles of article types and topic categories using the pyramid plot. Social network analysis (SNA) was performed to highlight prominent entities for providing a quick look at the study result. The authors examined the MeSH prediction effect on article citations using its correlation coefficients (CC). Results: The most frequent article types and topic categories were research support by institutes (56\%) and epidemiology (28\%). The most productive countries were the United States (42\%), followed by the United Kingdom (13\%), Germany (9\%), and the Netherlands (9\%). Most articles were published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (15\%) and JAMA Psychiatry (9\%). MeSH terms were evident in prediction power on the number of article citations (correlation coefficient = 0.39; t = 4.1; n = 94; 6 articles were excluded because they do not have MeSH terms). Conclusions: The breakthrough was made by developing 1 dashboard to display 100 top-cited articles on ADHD. MeSH terms can be used in predicting article citations on ADHD. These visualizations of the top 100 most-cited articles could be applied to future academic pursuits and other academic disciplines.","10.1186/s12991-021-00329-3","6",NA,"1744-859X","WOS:000609471900001","smile, chien/AAA-1053-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,189

Comorbidity-i.e., the presence of multiple chronic diseases-is associated with adverse health outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life as well as financial burden. Understanding the progression of comorbidities can provide valuable insights towards the prevention and better management of chronic diseases. Administrative data can be used in this regard as they contain semantic information on patients' health conditions. Most studies in this field are focused on understanding the progression of one chronic disease rather than multiple diseases. This study aims to understand the progression of two chronic diseases in the Australian health context. It specifically focuses on the comorbidity progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the prevalence of these chronic diseases in Australians is high. A research framework is proposed to understand and represent the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM using graph theory and social network analysis techniques. Two study cohorts (i.e., patients with both T2DM and CVD and patients with only T2DM) were selected from an administrative dataset obtained from an Australian health insurance company. Two baseline disease networks were constructed from these two selected cohorts. A final disease network from two baseline disease networks was then generated by weight adjustments in a normalized way. The prevalence of renal failure, fluid and electrolyte disorders, hypertension and obesity was significantly higher in patients with both CVD and T2DM than patients with only T2DM. This showed that these chronic diseases occurred frequently during the progression of CVD in patients with T2DM. The proposed network-based model may potentially help the healthcare provider to understand high-risk diseases and the progression patterns between the recurrence of T2DM and CVD. Also, the framework could be useful for stakeholders including governments and private health insurers to adopt appropriate preventive health management programs for patients at a high risk of developing multiple chronic diseases.","10.3390/ijerph17020596","596",NA,"1660-4601","WOS:000516827400217","Uddin, Shahadat/E-1963-2011 Moni, Mohammad Ali/ABG-3606-2020 ","Uddin, Shahadat/0000-0003-0091-6919 Moni, Mohammad Ali/0000-0003-0756-1006 Hossain, Md Ekramul/0000-0001-6913-8313 Khan, Arif/0000-0002-5793-933X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,190

This study applies an innovative combination of relative risk and social network analysis to enrolment data of a single cohort of commencing students from an Australian regional university. Relative risk, often used in epidemiology studies, is used to strategically investigate whether first year mathematics subjects at the university demonstrated a higher risk of attrition when compared to other subjects offered in the first year of study. The network analysis is used to illustrate the connections of those mathematics subjects, identifying service subjects through their multiple connections. The analysis revealed that attrition rates for eight of the nine subjects were within acceptable limits, and this included identified service subjects. The exception highlighted the issue of mathematics competencies in this cohort. This combined analytical technique is proposed as appropriate for use when investigating attrition and retention at faculty and institutional levels, including the determination of levels of intervention and support for any subject.","10.1080/0020739X.2018.1520932",NA,"0020-739X","1464-5211","WOS:000460163100007","Chamberlain, Dan E/K-1809-2015 ","Woolcott, Geoff/0000-0003-0094-7256",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,192

Despite rapid methodological advances, how to effectively and efficiently estimate the parameters of spatial dynamic panel models remains a challenging problem. To tackle this problem, we construct consistent complex least-squares estimators by the eigendecomposition of a spatial weight matrix method originally proposed for undirected networks. We no longer require all eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be real, which is a remarkable achievement as it implies that the proposed method is now applicable to spatiotemporal data modeling of directed networks. Under mild, interpretable conditions, we show that the proposed parameter estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We also present a complex orthogonal greedy algorithm for variable selection and rigorously investigate its convergence properties. Moreover, we incorporate fixed effects into the spatial dynamic panel models and provide a model transformation so that the proposed method can also be applied to the transformed model. Extensive simulation studies and data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","10.1016/j.jeconom.2023.105605","105605","0304-4076","1872-6895","WOS:001110850900001",NA,NA,"NOV 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,198

Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term goal is to use risk-based information from empirical socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors. Objective: This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2) evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission of S aureus. Methods: We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history, etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S aureus transmission. Results: We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on the original funded design for this project (\#NIH U54MD012388). That design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337 individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined data monitoring procedures. Conclusions: This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for completion of this 5-year study of the social and cultural parameters of S aureus carriage and transmission.","10.2196/14853","e14853","1929-0748",NA,"WOS:000488621400005","Pearson, Talima/O-7840-2019 Barger, Steven D./I-3724-2012 Lininger, Monica/N-4833-2015","Pearson, Talima/0000-0003-3696-041X Wayment, Heidi A./0000-0001-5287-5966 Hepp, Crystal/0000-0002-0612-3648 Kyman, Shari/0000-0001-5386-5866 Villa, Francisco/0000-0002-0522-7576 Hurtado, Kevin/0000-0002-8237-414X Barger, Steven D./0000-0002-8296-0974 Lininger, Monica/0000-0001-6221-0642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,199

This polymerisation process is used to manufacture a broad range of polymeric materials, including: polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, and many others. We link features of step-growth polymerisation to the properties of the directed configuration model. In this way, we obtain new analytical expressions describing the polymeric microstructure and compare them to data from experiments and computer simulations. The molecular weight distribution is related to the sizes of connected components, gelation to the emergence of the giant component, and the molecular gyration radii to the Wiener index of these components. A model on this level of generality is instrumental in accelerating the design of new materials and optimizing their properties, as well as it provides a vital link between network science and experimentally observable physics of polymers.","10.1038/s41598-018-37942-4","2276","2045-2322",NA,"WOS:000459092800046","Kryven, Ivan/X-3284-2019 ","Kryven, Ivan/0000-0002-3964-2196 Schamboeck, Verena/0000-0001-8357-2204",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,201

Contagion models, in particular, have proven helpful in the study of information diffusion, a very topical issue thanks to its applications to social media/network analysis, viral marketing campaigns, influence maximization and prediction. In bibliographic networks, for instance, an information diffusion process takes place when some authors, that publish papers in a given topic, influence some of their neighbors (coauthors, citing authors, collaborators) to publish papers in the same topic, and the latter influence their neighbors in their turn. This well-accepted definition, however, does not consider that influence in bibliographic networks is a complex phenomenon involving several scientific and cultural aspects. In fact, in scientific citation networks, influential topics are usually considered those ones that spread most rapidly in the network. Although this is generally a fact, this semantics does not consider that topics in bibliographic networks evolve continuously. In fact, knowledge, information and ideas are dynamic entities that acquire different meanings when passing from one person to another. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new definition of influence that captures the diffusion of inspiration within the network. We call it inspiration score, and show its effectiveness in detecting the most inspiring topics, authors, papers and venues in a citation network built upon two large bibliographic datasets. We show that the inspiration score can be used as an alternative or complementary bibliographic index in academic ranking applications.","10.1007/s10994-019-05828-9",NA,"0885-6125","1573-0565","WOS:000542345400004","Pensa, Ruggero G./B-5994-2011","Pensa, Ruggero G./0000-0001-5145-3438",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,202

Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. Methods: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a <= 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis. Results: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility (kappa score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0). Conclusions: Our study suggests that socioeconomic factors, namely residing in a homeless shelter and spending time in a gambling house, combined with the superspreading event effect may have been significant factors explaining the rise in cases in this predominantly Inuit Arctic community.","10.1093/cid/ciaa420",NA,"1058-4838","1537-6591","WOS:000670819400065","Sharma, Meenu/AAE-2536-2022 Cameron, Bill/E-9180-2010 Sharma, Meenu/GWM-5030-2022 ","Sharma, Meenu/0000-0002-6020-9995 Cameron, Bill/0000-0002-0090-3539 Pakhale, Smita/0000-0002-4051-962X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,207

Throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), children are consuming unhealthy diets, characterized by energy-dense, processed and ultra-processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages, and limited quantities of fruits and vegetables. Community-based school meal programmes (SMPs) have been identified as useful vehicles to address unhealthy eating among children, and ``farm-to-school{''} approaches have the potential to increase the availability of locally grown nutritious produce, while supporting local agriculture and reducing the region's reliance on food imports. This paper seeks to better understand the barriers to enhancing community-based school feeding value-chains in the CARICOM, by focusing on the Eastern Caribbean Island of Nevis where there is an interest in developing farm-to-school value chains. Using key informant interviews combined with focus groups with actors along the local food value chain, we identify the following barriers to an effective community-based SMP: a lack of communication and an absence of contractual agreements between local farmers and the SMP administration; generally low levels of child acceptance of school meals containing fresh vegetables; and limited intersectoral coordination and collaboration among SMP stakeholders and local farmers. Using social network analysis, we further discuss limitations in group organization and coordination among local farmers and opportunities for SMP improvement. The results point to the need for more integrative public policy development and greater community engagement to coordinate and strengthen the farm-to school approach to school feeding.","10.1007/s12571-023-01395-z",NA,"1876-4517","1876-4525","WOS:001070288200001",NA,NA,"SEP 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,208

To date, there is limited evidence on how and why such networks emerge. Therefore, the aims of this study were (a) to analyze the structural properties and (b) to identify the conditions of cooperation in interorganizational community networks of sport and physical activity promotion. Methods: Survey data on cooperative relationships and organizational attributes of sports and physical activity providers as well as sports administrating organizations in two community networks located in urban districts in southern Germany were collected (Network I: n = 133 organizations; Network II: n = 50 organizations). Two quantitative descriptive procedures - network analysis and stochastic analyses of network modeling (exponential random graphs) - were applied. Results: Similar structures and conditions of cooperation were found in the networks (e.g. low density, centralization). The community sports administrations had the most central positions in both networks. Exponential random graph modeling showed that cooperation took place more frequently in triangular structures (closure effect) and revolved around a few central actors (preferential attachment effect). Organizations from different sectors cooperated more often than organizations from the same sector (heterophily effect). Conclusion: The study provided valid and robust findings on significant mechanisms and conditions of interorganizational cooperation in community networks focused on sport and physical activity promotion.

Therefore, this study took 366 cities in China as the research subjects while exploring the relationship between urban contact and the outbreak of the pandemic from both national and regional perspectives using social network analysis (SNA), Pearson correlation analysis and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) modeling. The results revealed that the number of COVID-19 infections in China fluctuated with strain variation over the study period; the urban contact network exhibited a significant trend of recovery. The pandemic had a hindering effect on national urban contact, and this effect weakened progressively. Meanwhile, the effect exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with a weakening effect in the eastern region \& AP; northeast region > central region > western region, indicating a decreasing phenomenon from coastal to inland areas. Moreover, the four major economic regions in China featured border barrier effects, whereby urban contact networks constituted by cross-regional flows were more sensitive to the development of the pandemic.

Using a modified spatial gravity model, we constructed and analyzed the spatial correlation network of these health resource agglomeration capacities and their influencing factors through social network analysis. We found that: (i) China's health resource agglomeration capacity had a gradual strengthening trend, with capacity weakening from east to west (strongest in the eastern region, second strongest in the central region, and weakest in the western region). (ii) The spatial network of such capacities became more densely connected, and the network density and level (efficiency) showed an upward (downward) trend. (iii) In terms of centrality, the high-ranking provinces (or municipalities) were Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Tianjin, while the low-ranking were Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xinjiang, Hainan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. (iv) Block 1 (eight provinces or municipalities), including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, had a ``net spillover{''} effect in the spatial network of health resource agglomeration capacities; Block 2, (seven provinces or municipalities), including Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, had a ``bidirectional spillover{''} effect in the spatial network; Block 3 (seven provinces or municipalities), including Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, had a ``mediator{''} effect in the network; and Block 4, (nine provinces or municipalities), including Sichuan, Guizhou, and Tibet, had a ``net beneficial{''} effect in the network. (v) The economic development, urbanization wage, and financial health expenditure levels, and population size had significant positive correlations with the spatial network of health resource agglomeration capacities.

We provide a case study of systems science application to address geographic CVD health disparities at the community level - informing the science of CVD health disparities research. MethodsWe conducted a two-phased, multi-methods needs assessment in the Denver, Colorado area. Phase I consisted of a social network analysis to map a two-mode network of existing CVD prevention interventions and their implementing organizations. In Phase II, group model building (GMB) sessions with key community, public health, and healthcare provider stakeholders, were utilized to identify and visualize community factors contributing to disparities in CVD risk, producing a consensus-based causal loop diagram. ResultsBetween May 2021 and June 2022, we conducted 24 virtual, semi-structured interviews in Phase I to describe CVD prevention interventions, and 7 virtual GMB sessions in Phase II to describe experiences of disparities in CVD risk. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on a subset of results for both phases. In Phase I we identified 89 active CVD prevention interventions, 29 of which addressed tobacco use. In Phase II, causal loop diagrams revealed root causes of disparities in CVD risk. We provide an example of a causal loop diagram that focuses on the community prevalence of tobacco use, identifying stress as a key underlying factor driving disparities. The integration of findings from both phases highlighted the alignment and misalignment between quit tobacco intervention goals and how they are being experienced in marginalized communities. ConclusionSystems science methods were useful to organize a large number of CVD prevention efforts, and evaluate the root causes of CVD health disparities in a high risk community. By integrating these two aspects, interventions may be reoriented to more effectively address the root causes of CVD health disparities.","10.3389/fcvm.2023.1216436","1216436","2297-055X",NA,"WOS:001034163700001",NA,"Haapanen, Krista/0000-0002-5014-3363",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,218

These datasets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical ``laws{''} that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis.

However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where a representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S. Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate approach uses the effective resistances of edges, which prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10\% of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread. Author summary Epidemiologists increasingly use social networks to understand how geography, demographics, and human mobility affect disease spread and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. While highly detailed data on human social networks are now available, the size and density of these modern networks makes them computationally intensive to study. To address this challenge, we study methods for reducing a network to its most important links. Following recent work in computer science, we use the effective resistance, which takes both local and global connectivity into account. We test this method in simulations on a U.S.-wide mobility network and find that it preserves epidemic dynamics with high fidelity. Combined with efficient epidemic simulation algorithms, our approach can facilitate a more effective response to epidemics.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010650","e1010650","1553-734X","1553-7358","WOS:000926070200002",NA,"Mercier, Alexander/0000-0001-6295-1416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,220

These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (similar to 94\%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7\% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50\%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.","10.3390/microorganisms9020227","227",NA,"2076-2607","WOS:000622821000001","Pozo, Pilar/CAG-1393-2022 Alvarez, Julio/H-8292-2013 Pozo, Pilar/O-1728-2018 Grisi-Filho, Jose/J-2523-2012","Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873 Alvarez, Julio/0000-0002-8999-9417 Pozo, Pilar/0000-0002-2003-2873 Cespedes Cardenas, Nicolas/0000-0001-7884-2353 Grisi-Filho, Jose/0000-0002-3263-2147",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,221

The lessons learned from the S\&T response of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to assess how new S\&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20\% of all publications and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5\% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focusof patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.","10.1186/s12889-019-6842-x","530",NA,"1471-2458","WOS:000467609400002","FONSECA, FERNANDA/HDN-9451-2022 Fonseca, Fernanda/V-3446-2019 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/AAD-8584-2020 ","FONSECA, FERNANDA/0000-0002-0315-6479 Pereira-Silva, Marcus VinÃ­cius/0000-0002-4135-4011 Guindalini, Camila/0000-0002-6278-5881 Fonseca, Bruna de Paula/0000-0002-8795-2578 Fonseca, Fernanda/0000-0001-6852-6912",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,224

A novel guidance document was introduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia (BC), Canada, which supported clinicians to prescribe opioids, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. We aimed to determine the extent to which uptake and discontinuation of an initial attempt at a prescribed safer supply (PSS) program were influenced through networks of prescribers.MethodsWe executed a retrospective population-based study using linked health administrative data that captured all clinicians who prescribed to at least one client with a substance use disorder from March 27, 2020, to August 31, 2021. Our main exposure was the prescribing patterns of an individuals' peers, defined as the proportion of a prescribers' professional network (based on shared clients), which had previously prescribed PSS, updated monthly. The primary outcome measured whether a clinician had prescribed their initial PSS prescription during a given calendar month. The secondary outcome was the discontinuation of PSS prescribing, defined as an absence for PSS prescriptions for at least 3 months. We estimated logistic regression models using generalized estimated equations on monthly repeated measurements to determine and characterize the extent to which peer networks influenced the initiation and discontinuation of PSS prescribing, controlling for network, clinician, and caseload characteristics. Innovators were defined as individuals initiating PSS prior to May 2020, and early adopters were individuals initiating PSS after.ResultsAmong 14,137 prescribers treating clients with substance use disorder, there were 228 innovators of prescribed safer supply and 1062 early adopters through the end of study follow-up, but 653 (50.6\%) were no longer prescribing by August 2021. Prescribers with over 20\% of peers whom had adopted PSS had a nearly fourfold higher adjusted odds of PSS prescribing themselves (aOR: 3.79, 95\% CI: (3.15, 4.56)), compared to those with no connected safer supply prescribers.ConclusionsThe uptake of PSS in BC was highly dependent on the behavior of prescribers' peer networks. Future implementation strategies to support PSS or other policies would benefit from leveraging networks of prescribers.","10.1186/s13012-023-01331-x","3","1748-5908",NA,"WOS:001137205500001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,225

Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. Methods and analysis A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5-7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences.

Chinese OHCs are no exception. However, user-generated content (UGC) and the associated user behaviors in Chinese OHCs are largely underexplored and rarely analyzed systematically, forfeiting valuable opportunities for optimizing treatment design and care delivery with insights gained from OHCs. Objective: This study aimed to reveal both the shared and distinct characteristics of 2 popular OHCs in China by systematically and comprehensively analyzing their UGC and the associated user behaviors. Methods: We concentrated on studying the lung cancer forum (LCF) and breast cancer forum (BCF) on Mijian, and the diabetes consultation forum (DCF) on Sweet Home, because of the importance of the 3 diseases among Chinese patients and their prevalence on Chinese OHCs in general. Our analysis explored the key user activities, small-world effect, and scale-free characteristics of each social network. We examined the UGC of these forums comprehensively and adopted the weighted knowledge network technique to discover salient topics and latent relations among these topics on each forum. Finally, we discussed the public health implications of our analysis findings. Results: Our analysis showed that the number of reads per thread on each forum followed gamma distribution (H-L=0, H-B=0, and H-D=0); the number of replies on each forum followed exponential distribution (adjusted R-L(2) =0.946, adjusted R-B(2)=0.958, and adjusted R-D(2) =0.971); and the number of threads a user is involved with (adjusted R-L(2)=0.978, adjusted R-B(2)=0.964, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.970), the number of followers of a user (adjusted R-L(2)=0.989, adjusted R-B(2)=0.962, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.990), and a user's degrees (adjusted R-L(2)=0.997, adjusted R-B(2)=0.994, and adjusted R-D(2)=0.968) all followed power-law distribution. The study further revealed that users are generally more active during weekdays, as commonly witnessed in all 3 forums. In particular, the LCF and DCF exhibited high temporal similarity (rho=0.927; P<.001) in terms of the relative thread posting frequencies during each hour of the day. Besides, the study showed that all 3 forums exhibited the small-world effect (mean sigma(L)=517.15, mean sigma(B)=275.23, and mean sigma(D)=525.18) and scale-free characteristics, while the global clustering coefficients were lower than those of counterpart international OHCs. The study also discovered several hot topics commonly shared among the 3 disease forums, such as disease treatment, disease examination, and diagnosis. In particular, the study found that after the outbreak of COVID-19, users on the LCF and BCF were much more likely to bring up COVID-19-related issues while discussing their medical issues. Conclusions: UGC and related online user behaviors in Chinese OHCs can be leveraged as important sources of information to gain insights regarding individual and population health conditions. Effective and timely mining and utilization of such content can continuously provide valuable firsthand clues for enhancing the situational awareness of health providers and policymakers.","10.2196/19183","e19183","1438-8871",NA,"WOS:000740354600002",NA,"ZHOU, Linyun/0000-0001-6500-537X Lei, Yuqi/0000-0001-6984-9609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,229

In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity. Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways, though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p < 0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread transmission via this route. By combining genetic data with network analysis, this research advances our understanding of dynamics of between-farm spread of PRRSV, helps establish the relative importance of transmission via animal movements versus local area spread, and highlights the potential for targeted control strategies based upon heterogeneities in network connectivity.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.104977","104977","0167-5877","1873-1716","WOS:000533510200014","Makau, Dennis/I-2883-2019 Paploski, Igor/D-7015-2014","Makau, Dennis/0000-0002-1802-2545 VanderWaal, Kimberly/0000-0002-5764-6430 Paploski, Igor/0000-0002-3689-2042",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,230

We used social network analysis to evaluate whether contacts have the same S. aureus genotype indicating direct transmission or whether contagiousness is an indirect effect of contacts sharing the same lifestyle or characteristics. METHODS: The Fit Futures 1 study collected data on social contact among 1038 high school students. S. aureus carriage was determined from two nasal swab cultures and the genotype was determined by spa-typing of positive throat swabs. RESULTS: S. aureus carriage and spa-type were transmitted in the social network (P < 0.001). The probability of carriage increased by 5\% for each S. aureus positive contact. Male sex was associated with a 15\% lower risk of transmission compared to the female sex, although the carriage prevalence was higher for men (36\% vs 24\%). Students with medium physical activity levels, medium/high alcohol use, or normal weight had a higher number of contacts and an increased risk of transmission (P < 0.002). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the direct social transmission of S. aureus. Lifestyle factors are associated with the risk of transmission, suggesting the effects of indirect social groups on S. aureus carriage, such as friends having more similar environmental exposures. The male predominance in the carriage is determined by sex-specific predisposing host characteristics as the social transmission is less frequent in males than females.

In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate to each other and call for a complexity science approach to advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in 191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs. We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time. We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling) could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens in an urban context.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,242

In this phase, the group of friends becomes increasingly important, being a situation of vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an escape mechanism or due to peer's influence. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the structure of the consumption and friendship network, the intention to use cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: An online platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were used for data collection. RESULTS: The sample consisted of adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from a third-year class of compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (Le{\'o}n, Spain). Significant differences were obtained concerning consumption intention and the different network metrics in both the friendship and consumption networks. Subsequently, the representation of these networks was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Social Network Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a picture of the context in which adolescents are located.

Reasons for that increase remain unclear, but the inter-organizational arrangement of organ donation programs may have contributed. However, there is a paucity of literature investigating these inter-organizational arrangements, with a limited understanding of how communication facilitates organ donation. Understanding these arrangements may help to re-establish rising organ donation rates post-pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe interprofessional interactions of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators (OTDCs) during organ donation cases, within organ donation programs in Ontario, from an organizational perspective (describing structure, context, process). METHODS: Mixed-method social network analysis (SNA) approach analyzing 14 organ donation cases just before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Structure: Social network graphs depict the joint work performed by hospital staff and OTDCs, with a great part of the communication being processed through the OTDC. CONTEXT: Network density ranged from 0.05 to 0.24 across cases, and health care professionals perceived an atmosphere of shared vision and trust among team members. PROCESS: Most networks had a degree centralization <0.50 suggesting a decentralized information flow, and participants perceived decisions being jointly made. The characteristic path length of cases ranged from 1.6 to 3.2, suggesting potential for rapid information diffusion. Overall, data reinforced the OTDC role of intermediator within the communication process, and hospital staff perceived OTDCs as central players. Hospital staff and OTDCs reported frustration with some aspects of the flow of information during the organ allocation processes.

Given the salience of peer relationships during adolescence, and research suggesting that mental health disorders negatively impact social functioning, this study uses novel methodology from social network analysis to uncover the social processes linking disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders with adolescent friendships. In particular, the study focuses on peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer homophily in relation to both disorders. METHODS: Data come from 15-year old students in four Scottish secondary schools (N = 602). Diagnoses of disruptive behavior disorders and anxiety disorders were produced using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, and peer relationship data were obtained through a friendship nomination survey. Exponential random graph models were used to estimate the probability of peer withdrawal, peer popularity, and peer homophily based on each disorder. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders were more popular than their peers without disruptive behavior disorders (OR: 1.47, CI: 1.20, 1.87). Friendship was also more likely between two adolescents both with or both without disruptive behavior disorders (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.07, 1.47), demonstrating peer homophily. There was no evidence that anxiety disorders were related to adolescent peer relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that disruptive behavior disorders may be socially rewarded (e.g., peer popularity) and socially clustered (e.g., homophily), whereas anxiety disorders show no such trends. Thus, intervention efforts must account for the peer social status that may be gained from engaging in disruptive behavior during this developmental period. Further, given that similarity in DBD status is associated with an increased likelihood of friendship, adolescents are likely to be surrounded by peers who reinforce their behaviors.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Adolescents; Anxiety disorders; Disruptive behaviour disorders; Mental health; Peers; Social networks","en",NA,NA,NA,247

The model was able to produce networks with largely comparable characteristics and total numbers of incident HIV infections. Although the model was unable to produce networks with comparable cohesiveness (where the observed network had a transitivity value 35.7 standard deviations from the mean of the simulated networks), the structural variability of the simulated networks allowed for investigation into their potential facilitation of HIV transmission.

METHODS: We analyzed all tweets containing \#BTSM from 2012 to 2018 using the Symplur Signals platform to obtain data and to describe Symplur-defined user categories, tweet content, and trends in use over time. We created a network plot with all publicly available retweets involving \#BTSM in 2018 to visualize key stakeholders and their connections to other users.

In many cities, transitions toward green stormwater infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network-specifically, betweenness centrality and openness-defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,252

We characterize the retweet network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization.

Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways.

A key question is whether the impact of social position on smoking depends on an adolescent's level of coping motives (i.e., their desire to use smoking to mitigate negative affect). METHOD: We assessed how social position predicts nicotine dependence in a longitudinal sample (N = 3,717; 44.8\% male; mean age = 13.41 years) of adolescent lifetime smokers measured between 6th and 12th grades. Using both social network analysis and multilevel modeling, we assessed this question at the between-person and within-person level, hypothesizing that within-person decreases in social position would lead to increased risk of nicotine dependence among those with high levels of coping motives. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, only interactions with the between-person measures of social position were found, with a slight negative relationship at low levels of coping motives. In addition, the main effect of coping motives was considerably stronger than that of social position at the between-person level, and social position had no significant within-person main effect on nicotine dependence risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adolescents with higher overall levels of social position among their peers may have slightly decreased risk for nicotine dependence, but only when coping motives are low.

Here, we use a suite of spatial statistics and social network analysis to characterize animal movement among areas with an estimated distinct risk of disease circulation to ultimately enhance surveillance activities. Our model utilized equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) outbreaks, between-farm horse movements, and spatial landscape data from 2015 through 2017. We related EIAV occurrence and the movement of horses between farms with climate variables that foster conditions for local disease propagation. We then constructed a spatially explicit model that allows the effect of the climate variables on EIAV occurrence to vary through space (i.e., non-stationary). Our results identified important areas in which in-going movements were more likely to result in EIAV infections and disease propagation. Municipalities were then classified as having high 56 (11.3\%), medium 48 (9.66\%), and low 393 (79.1\%) spatial risk. The majority of the movements were between low-risk areas, altogether representing 68.68\% of all animal movements. Meanwhile, 9.48\% were within high-risk areas, and 6.20\% were within medium-risk areas. Only 5.37\% of the animals entering low-risk areas came from high-risk areas. On the other hand, 4.91\% of the animals in the high-risk areas came from low- and medium-risk areas. Our results demonstrate that animal movements and spatial risk mapping could be used to make informed decisions before issuing animal movement permits, thus potentially reducing the chances of reintroducing infection into areas of low risk.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Germany","disease spread; movement flows; non-stationary Gaussian models; risk areas mapping; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,271

This study investigates whether and how public participation can affect central government policy response to this pandemic in the context of China. METHODS: This study constructs the theoretical framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New Media, and the central government response in this pandemic. RESULTS: Findings show that the Chinese central government does not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the central government, public participation firstly creates ``participation'' with the authority of the media, forms public opinion, and then the prompt policy response from the central government. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the central government will refer to public participation to decide the policy response.

Understanding the care and support networks of a frail individual could therefore prove useful in understanding need and designing support. This study explored the care and support networks of community-dwelling older people accessing a falls prevention service as a marker of likely frailty, by describing and comparing the individuals' networks as perceived by themselves and as perceived by healthcare providers involved in their care. METHODS: A convenience sample of 16 patients and 16 associated healthcare professionals were recruited from a community-based NHS 'Falls Group' programme within North-West London. Individual (i.e., one on one) semi-structured interviews were conducted to establish an individual's perceived network. Principles of quantitative social network analysis (SNA) helped identify the structural characteristics of the networks; qualitative SNA and a thematic analysis aided data interpretation. RESULTS: All reported care and support networks showed a high contribution level from family and friends and healthcare professionals. In patient-reported networks, 'contribution level' was often related to the 'frequency' and 'helpfulness' of interaction. In healthcare professional reported networks, the reported frequency of interaction as detailed in patient records was used to ascertain 'contribution level'. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the importance of the role of informal carers and friends along with healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with frailty. There was congruence in the makeup of 'patient' and 'provider' reported networks, but more prominence of helper/carers in patients' reports. These findings also highlight the multidisciplinary makeup of a care and support network, which could be targeted by healthcare professionals to support the care of frail individuals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"England","Care and Support Networks; Community-Dwelling; Frailty; Older People; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,276

This study was implemented in the critical care unit, outpatient department, operation room, and ward of a small animal hospital. We conducted an observational study used for key player determination (or key node identification), then observed the selected key nodes twice with a one-month interval. Next, surface swabs of key nodes and their connecting nodes were analysed using bacterial identification, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Altogether, our results showed that veterinarians were key players in this contact network in all departments. We found two predominant similarity clusters; dendrogram results suggested E. coli isolates from different time points and places to be closely related, providing evidence of HAI circulation within and across hospital departments.

A growing body of work suggests that coalition network ties, which facilitate transmission of information and advocacy, may be a key part of how such leadership operates. This study provides an understanding of the structure of coalition networks and how this structure changes over time. Methods: We administered semiannual network surveys during a pilot whole-of-community intervention in Somerville, MA (2015-2017). Participants included 16 multisector coalition members and their nominated discussion partners (``first-degree alters'') related to childhood obesity prevention. Coalition and first-degree alter respondents named up to 20 discussion partners and reported ties' interaction frequency and perceived influence. Networks were assessed with visualization, descriptive analysis, and exponential random graph models. Results: Total network included 558 stakeholders representing community-based organizations, parents, health care, childcare, universities, among others. Size and membership varied over time. We observed the largest network (n = 256) during intervention planning, and the largest proportion of stakeholders communicating frequently (daily/weekly) about childhood obesity prevention during the peak intervention period. Networks were sparsely interconnected (1\%-3\% of possible ties observed) and most and least centralized at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Over time, ties were increasingly perceived as influential and siloed within community groups. Conclusions: The network's extensive evolving membership may indicate access to a wide range of resources, ideas, and an ability to broadly disseminate intervention messages. The attenuating network hierarchy over time may have supported more equal participation and control over intervention efforts.

This study aimed to identify patient-sharing networks among physicians in China and explore the effect of attributes of physician networks on healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was undertaken based on healthcare claims from Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance Data spanning the years 2015 to 2018. We identified patients with hypertension and modeled physician patient-sharing networks using social network analysis. Relationships among physicians were further quantified using network measures. We fitted a log-linear model to examine the association between networks and healthcare at the physician level. RESULTS: 29,321 patients, seen by 3,429 physicians from 57 hospitals in one eastern city of China were included. Physicians were connected to 21 other physicians (threshold = 1 shared patients) or 7 other physicians (threshold = 4, 6, or 8 shared patients). Degree and centrality measures of physicians at primary care facilities were significantly lower than those at secondary or tertiary hospitals (p < 0.001). The links between physicians at different hospital grades were weak and patients tended to flow among physicians at the same hospital grade. Compared with a low closeness centrality, a medium level was associated with fewer hospitalization costs and days, and high closeness centrality was accompanied by a sharper decrease (all P < 0.001).

Ego-centric and sociometric analyses were used to describe the support networks of marginalized young women. Marginalized young women go to other women and relatives for support, and they communicate face to face rather than using social media. Network maps show how young women were connected to each other.

The forwarding behavior of social media users on posts concerned with COVID-19 vaccine topics can rapidly disseminate vaccine information in a short period, which has a significant effect on transmission and helps the public access relevant information. However, the factors of social media users' forwarding posts are still uncertain thus far. In this paper, we investigated the factors of the forwarding COVID-19 vaccines Weibo posts on Chinese social media and verified the correlation between social network characteristics, Weibo textual sentiment characteristics, and post forwarding. METHODS: This paper used data mining, machine learning, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis. Using `` (COVID-19 vaccine)'' as the keyword, we used data mining to crawl 121,834 Weibo posts on Sina Weibo from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2021. Weibo posts not closely correlated with the topic of the COVID-19 vaccines were filtered out using machine learning. In the end, 3,158 posts were used for data analysis. The proportions of positive sentiment and negative sentiment in the textual of Weibo posts were calculated through sentiment analysis. On that basis, the sentiment characteristics of Weibo posts were determined. The social network characteristics of information transmission on the COVID-19 vaccine topic were determined through social network analysis. The correlation between social network characteristics, sentiment characteristics of the text, and the forwarding volume of posts was verified through regression analysis. RESULTS: The results suggest that there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of posting users in the social network structure and the amount of forwarding. The relationship between the closeness centrality and the forwarding volume was significantly positive. The betweenness centrality was significantly positively correlated with the forwarding volume. There was no significant relationship between the number of posts containing more positive sentiments and the forwarding volume of posts. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts containing more negative sentiments and the forwarding volume. CONCLUSION: According to the characteristics of users, COVID-19 vaccine posts from opinion leaders, ``gatekeepers,'' and users with high-closeness centrality are more likely to be reposted. Users with these characteristics should be valued for their important role in disseminating information about COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the sentiment contained in the Weibo post is an important factor influencing the public to forward vaccine posts. Special attention should be paid to the negative sentimental tendency contained in this post on Weibo to mitigate the negative impact of the information epidemic and improve the transmission effect of COVID-19 vaccine information.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","COVID-19 vaccine; emotion; forwarding behavior; social media; social network structure","en",NA,NA,NA,291

Heterosexual cycle (HET4) of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) is a social network strategy implemented in jurisdictions. The main objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate the utility of the NHBS HET cycle data for network analysis; 2) to apply statistical analysis in support of previous HIV research, as well as to develop new research results focused on demographic variables and prevention/intervention with respect to heterosexual HIV risk; and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with respect to the EHE plan. METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects. RESULTS: The results showed 3\% were tested positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI\% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645).

CONCLUSION: The network visualization was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest behavioral supplements for DC's HIV planning activities.

To propose the precise strategy for supervision of pig movements in Hunan Province, a weighted directed one-mode network was constructed using the data from the electronic animal health certificate platform in 2017. The nodes were designed as districts in Hunan and edges as flows of pig movement between districts. Social network analysis was used to analyse network characteristics and generalized linear models were performed to ascertain the socioeconomic factors that affect the pig movement network. During 2017, the pig movement network within the Hunan Province was composed of 122 nodes and 8562 directed connections, with a total of 510,973 shipments and 17,815,040 pigs moved. The network displayed a small-world topology, which had a higher clustering coefficient (0.4 vs. 0.1) and shorter average shortest path length (1.8 vs. 3.7) compared with equivalent random networks. The degree centrality positively correlated with closeness centrality (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) as well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). After restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the top 10 \% of degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by nearly 50 \% in the network, whereas the number of pigs was reduced by 94.0 \% when movement restrictions were implemented in areas with the top 50 \% of degree centrality. Observed network metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking in November and December. Generalized linear models showed that the size of the human population and per capita gross domestic product were the most important socioeconomic drivers of pig movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a small-world network in which the introduction and spread of diseases may be quicker. More human, material, and financial resources should be allocated to areas with higher centrality. Swine movements were seasonal, and the inspection and quarantine work should be reinforced in the fourth quarter, especially in November and December. Pig movements were more active in areas with larger populations and advanced economy, and stricter supervision in these areas should be implemented.

When such disasters occur, the central government of South Korea and its affiliated local governments-together with nongovernmental organizations-play a crucial role in crisis management systems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to corroborate the characteristics government ministries and domestic and foreign institutions exhibit through their interconnection when the parties are undergoing a disease-related catastrophe such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using the social network analysis technique, the span of the COVID-19 pandemic was segmented into 3 time frames, and the relational characteristics of the COVID-19 contagious disease response department and related agencies at home and abroad were analyzed based on 3 centralities. RESULTS: Evidence from the second and third time frames indicates that the agents reacting to contagious diseases do not necessarily hold the central position in the network. From this, it can be inferred that it is not only the primary host that plays a pivotal role but the key to a successful response to various disasters also lies in cooperation with the relevant parties. CONCLUSIONS: The incongruency between the findings of this paper and the existing disaster response system gives rise to the corollary that both the essential parties and the adjoining ones need to collaborate for a coordinated crisis response in disaster situations. Furthermore, much significance lies in the fact that this paper explores the various aspects that could surface among the host and relevant parties in a real-life pandemic.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canada","COVID-19; contagious disease response; government departments' networks; network structure; social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,301

A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67\% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95\% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95\% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to develop precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster outbreaks.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Korea (South)","COVID-19; Physical distancing; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,303

The introduction of legislation regulating tobacco use in public spaces varies across countries, impacting the tobacco control context. Thus reviewing our knowledge of how social networks may influence smoking differently within different contexts is required to facilitate the development of context-specific interventions. METHODS: The search, conducted on 31st May 2019, included the following smoking-related terms; schools, adolescents, peers and social networks. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied throughout the title and abstract screening and full text screening. Quality assessment and synthesis followed. Studies were narratively synthesised to identify changes according to legislative context. This synthesis was conducted separately for findings relating to three categories: socioeconomic status; social selection and influence; and network position. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. Differences in the relationship between network characteristics and smoking according to socioeconomic status were measured in five out of fifteen studies in Europe. Results varied across studies, with differences in network characteristics and their association with smoking varying both between schools of a differing and those of a similar socioeconomic composition. For studies conducted both before and after the introduction of comprehensive smoking legislation, the evidence for selection processes was more consistent than influence, which varied according to reciprocity. Findings showed that isolates were more likely to smoke and in-degree and out-degree centrality were related to smoking both before and after the introduction of legislation. The relationship between popularity and smoking was contingent on school level smoking prevalence in studies conducted before the introduction of legislation, but not after. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, effects according to socioeconomic status were underreported in the included studies and no consistent evidence of change after the introduction of a comprehensive smoking ban was observed. Further network analyses are required using more recent data to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how network processes may influence smoking differently according to socioeconomic status, and how adaptation could be used to enhance intervention effectiveness.

Less is known about the relationship between care fragmentation and total spending, and whether this relationship is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on the number of shared patients among providers (ie, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured using average path length, which describes how efficiently information flows among network members; longer path length indicates greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of care fragmentation and multivariable regression were used to analyze the relationship between care fragmentation and LVAD payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81\% male, 73\% white, 11\% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of 63.1 years (11.1). The mean (SD) level of care fragmentation in provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) payment from admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872).

Fast and efficient contact tracing and Sars-CoV-2 PCR-based testing of the close contacts of Health Care Workers with confirmed infections are essential steps to limit nosocomial outbreaks. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Bari Policlinico General University-Hospital (Apulia, Italy) and describes the management of a cluster of SARS-COV-2 infections in three Operative Units. The contact tracing activities and the measures implemented to control the outbreak are described. RESULTS: Among the 186 Health Care Workers active in the cluster setting, there were 9 (4.8\%) confirmed cases, including the index case. Due to the outbreak, three Operative Units were closed to limit virus circulation. Health Care Workers with confirmed infections tested negative after a mean of 28.0$\pm$6.6 days (range: 13-37) and none required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the health of Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 pandemic should be a public health priority.

Using social media analysis, data on information about services and care institutions were collected from virtual sources using the Google search engine, so as to assess relations among these actors in 2018. The results revealed a fragmented network centred on virtual sources and secondary and tertiary public care services, with striking proximity of press sources to public services. Also salient was the isolation of private services and the lack of dialogue between philanthropic and public services. Moreover, the information offered was found to be insufficient and superficial, despite the gaps in the formal rehabilitation network.

We sought to understand the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on ethnocultural communities to inform intersectoral advocacy and community action. METHODS: The Illuminate Project used participatory action research, with cultural health brokers as peer researchers, from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, 2020, in Edmonton, Alberta. Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with social network analysis. RESULTS: Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal health and social system supports. INTERPRETATION: The Illuminate Project has illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation.

To assess the actionability and success of that plan, both scientific and implementation elements must be taken into account. The aim of this study is to assess the 'Zero Childhood Cancer Personalised Medicine Program' (the Zero Program), an Australian first-ever and most comprehensive personalised medicine programme for children with high-risk or relapsed cancer, in terms of its structure, process and implementational effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will assess Program delivery mechanisms. The development of the implementation and evaluation strategy will concentrate on the work of the Zero Program as a complex whole. This includes the structure of collaborative links across stakeholder groups involved in Program development and delivery, changes to collaborative relationships over time and the impact of group working on Program outcomes. We are applying a mixed-methods design including: a rapid ethnography (observations of stakeholder interactions and informal conversations), Program professionals' completion of a rapid health implementation proforma and a social network analysis. Formative evaluations of the implementation science effects, applying feedback techniques, for example, Formative Evaluation Feedback Loops and the Zero Program professionals' feedback, will determine where Program tailoring may be needed. A repeat of the social network analysis downstream will examine network changes over time, followed by an expert panel using the expert recommendations for implementing change to assess the integration of implementation strategies into the Program structure. A summative evaluation of the Program will bring the research elements together, leading to comprehensive data triangulation and determining the sustainability and implementational effects of Program delivery.

Through the research, it is found that (1) on the national scale, the Chinese biomedicine innovation network becomes denser from west to the east as its complexity continuously increases. Its spatial structure takes the form of a radial network pattern with Beijing and Shanghai as its centers. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had an obvious negative impact on this network at present. (2) On the interregional scale, the strength of interregional network ties is greater than that of intraregional network ties. The eastern, central and western biomedicine innovation networks appear to be heterogeneous networks with regional central cities as the cores.

Research on economic patterns and urban network systems can provide a reference for healthy development of the regional economic system. The evolution of the economic pattern and urban network system of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2010 to 2020 is investigated using methods (e.g., the gravity center model, the gravitational force model, social network analysis, and geographic information system). (1) The gravity center of gross domestic product (GDP) of the GBA is located in Nansha district, Guangzhou, with a skewing direction northwest-east-northwest and a movement rate of ``large-small-large.'' The center of import and export and the center of consumption show a ``zigzagging migration'' in which the center of investment shows an ``irregular (random) migration''. (2) The economic connection degree of cities in the GBA exhibits a high ascending velocity, and the whole area tends to be mature, with a significant effect of spatial proximity. With the steady increase in network density, there is significant polarization of network centrality in the region. The four major cohesive subgroups have been relatively stable and consistent with the degree of geographic proximity of the cities. The center-periphery structure is more significant, in which the core area is extended to the cities on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary, thus forming the core cluster of ``Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Dongguan.'' In this study, the evolution of economic patterns and urban network systems in the GBA over the past decade is analyzed using multiple methods (i.e., gravity model, urban network system analysis, and geographic information system) based on urban socioeconomic data by starting from various spatial elements (e.g., ``points, lines, and networks'') to gain insights into and optimize research on regional economic development after the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Switzerland","Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area (GBA); economic pattern; gravity center model; social network; urban network","en",NA,NA,NA,332

However, most analyses focus solely on direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution of live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases. Here, we used French live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one of the largest transport companies to compare direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate how these patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614 farms were included in the study, and two directed networks were generated: the animal introduction network (exchange of live ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles). Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were scrutinized in relation to farm infection status during the epidemic. Results showed that farms were substantially more connected in the transit network than in the animal introduction network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals. We also showed that animal introduction and transit networks' statistics decreased substantially during the epidemic (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a probability of 33.3 \% that a farm exposed to the infection through either of the two live duck movement networks (i.e. that was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was reported as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within seven days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that the level of exposure of farms by these two contact patterns was low, leading only to a handful of transmission events through these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live animal movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but have been efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the French 2020-2021 epidemic. These results underpin the relevance of studying indirect contacts resulting from the movement of animals to understand their transmission potential and the importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease control strategies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Animal introduction and transit networks; Biosecurity; Disease transmission; Epidemiological modelling; Poultry; Social network analysis","en",NA,NA,NA,333

Here, we sought here to assign unreported HIV risk factors in blood donors (BDs) and reevaluated the MSM-associated fraction of HIV transfusion residual risk (\%RR(MSM) ). METHODS: We applied a genetic distance-based approach to infer an HIV transmission network for 384 HIV sequences from French BDs and 1337 HIV sequences from individuals with known risk factors (ANRS PRIMO primary HIV infection cohort). We validated the possibility of assigning a risk factor according to clustering using assortative mixing. Finally, we recalculated the \%RR(MSM) . RESULTS: A total of 81 of 284 (28.5\%) male and 5 of 100 (5\%) female BDs belonged to a cluster; 72 (88.9\%) of the 81 male BDs belonged to MSM clusters. After cluster correction, 8 of 67 (11.9\%), 4 of 21 (19.0\%), and 19 of 88 (21.6\%) HIV-positive (HIV+) male BDs with heterosexual, other, or unknown risk factors could be reclassified as MSM, accounting for 10.9\% of the total HIV+ male BDs. Overall, 139 of 284 HIV+ male donors (48.9\%) could be considered MSM between 2000 and 2016 in France. Between 2005 and 2016, the \%RR(MSM) increase varied from 0 to 19\%, without differing significantly from the \%RR(MSM) before reclassification.

Survey data were collected in Chicago, Illinois, USA, between 2018 and 2019 from Black SGM. A total of 371 participants provided individual-level information about sociodemographic characteristics and HIV vulnerability from sex (i.e., condomless sex, group sex, use of alcohol/drugs to enhance sex) and completed an egocentric network inventory assessing perceptions of their social network members' (alters') injunctive and descriptive norms surrounding sexual behaviors with increased HIV vulnerability. We used Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify network-level norms based on the proportion of alters' approval of the participant engaging in condomless sex, group sex, and use of drugs to enhance sex (i.e., injunctive norms) and alters' engagement in these behaviors (i.e., descriptive norms). We then used binomial regression analyses to examine associations between network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV vulnerability from sex. The results of our LPA indicated that our sample experienced five distinct latent profiles of network-level norms: (1) low HIV vulnerability network norm, (2) moderately high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability network norm, (4) condomless sex dominant network norm, and (5) approval of drug use during sex dominant network norm. Condomless anal sex, group sex, and using drugs to enhance sex were positively and significantly associated with higher HIV vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV vulnerability norm profiles.

Interview themes were identified and inter-relationships between themes were explored through social network analysis. Participants discussed the importance of cultural traditions in coping, including subsistence, dancing and drumming, intergenerational transmission of knowledge, and reflective awareness of interconnections with others. Participants found strength in family relationships, spirituality, helping others, and coming together as a community. Three coping clusters emerged: Ilaliurucaraq (be welcoming) involved opening one's frame of mind and building connections; Yuuyaraq (Yup'ik way of life) focused on Yup'ik traditions and values; and Assircaarturluni Yuuyaraq (try to live a better life) involved healing from historical trauma. Findings illustrate the resilience and evolving strengths of rural Yup'ik communities facing a continually changing cultural landscape and provide information for developing community-driven culturally based interventions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,344

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,347

Our aim was to better understand the transmission dynamics of TB in this remote region of Canada using whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: Isolates from patients who had culture-positive pulmonary TB in Iqaluit, Nunavut, between 2009 and 2015 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The number of transmission events between cases within clusters was calculated using a threshold of a $\leq$3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference between isolates and then combined with detailed epidemiological data using a reproducible novel algorithm. Social network analysis of epidemiological data was used to support the WGS data analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 140 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 135 cases were sequenced. Four clusters were identified, all from Euro-American lineage. One cluster represented 62\% of all cases that were sequenced over the entire study period. In this cluster, 2 large chains of transmission were associated with 3 superspreading events in a homeless shelter. One of the superspreading events was linked to a nonsanctioned gambling house that resulted in further transmission. Shelter to nonshelter transmission was also confirmed. An algorithm developed for the determination of transmission events demonstrated very good reproducibility ($\kappa$ score .98, 95\% confidence interval, .97-1.0).

A whole network study was carried out in 2013 and 2016 among adolescents (n = 18,805) in 38 schools located in six European cities. Overall, diffusion centrality of smoking in general and of smoking on school premises significantly decreased over time. Diffusion centrality of smoking significantly decreased both in schools where the policy strengthened or softened over time, but for diffusion of smoking on school premises, this decrease was only significant in schools where it strengthened. Finally, stronger school tobacco policies were associated with lower diffusion centrality of smoking on school premises and of smoking in general, though to a lesser extent.

Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on Twitter.

Indeed, the movement of live animals and of the means of transport is one of the main risk factors in the spread of diseases and this is particularly relevant in areas with high stocking density. DESIGN: statistical analysis on movements of pigs entering Lombardy was carried out. Data on pigs' movements and farm characteristics were collected from the National and Regional databases. Social Network Analysis (SNA) was used to analyse the flows of pigs to Lombardy, to identify the holdings and geographical areas that are central in the trading network and that could have a role in the introduction of swine pathogens into the region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data on pigs' movements introduced into Lombardy in 2016 were analysed. Lombardy is a region of Northern Italy with intensive livestock husbandry. The pig sector is of particular economic relevance also in view of the processing industry, suited to the production of high quality pork products. Annually about 1.8 million pigs are introduced into the region also to satisfy the request of the processing industry for the production of pork products. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: in this study, the farms that buy pigs from outside the region were identified as well as the territories where the largest number of pigs are introduced. The analysis was carried out also considering certain factors related to the movement of animals, which can be relevant for the transmission of pathogens, such as number of commercial partners, number of exchanged animals, and number of shipments. RESULTS: in 2016, 1,782,568 pigs were introduced into Lombardy; by using SNA, it was possible to highlight a complex trade network of pigs, mainly involving the Northern regions. Indeed, the pigs were mostly purchased from Emilia Romagna (33.4\%), followed by Veneto and Piedmont. These regions have been the most closely analysed in this study. SNA was also used to identify Lombardy territories (provinces and municipalities) which, based on the number of introduced pigs, are potentially most exposed to the introduction of pathogens from outside the region. Mantua and Brescia provinces resulted the most exposed area. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is one of most important European producers of pigs and about 50\% of national pig assets is present in Lombardy; furthermore, about 1.8 million pigs are introduced yearly into the region. Currently, the region is free from the main diseases of pigs and the introduction of an epidemic disease into the pig population could adversely affect the entire productive sector. For this reason, an analysis of the movements of pigs entering the region was carried out to identify the areas (provinces, municipalities) and holdings most exposed to the risk of introduction of pathogens. This information is relevant for the veterinary authorities to plan appropriate control activities (official controls, surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination, where possible) in order to enhance disease prevention and promote early detection.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Italy","pig movements; social network analysis; pathogen transmission","it",NA,NA,NA,371

Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia. To sum up, races/ethnicities not only vary in structure and timing of death but they differ in morbid processes leading to death as well.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"United States",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,372
